It occurred to me that some of them may have been alive when George VI gave the actual speech to the British Nation which had just declared war with Hitler.The King's Speech is a feel good movie, but a very adult one, and while it tells a good story, well scripted, absorbing and believable (except for an odd line or two), Tom Hooper's film is far more driven by character than by plot.You may need to see it to believe it but, Colin Firth has no obvious competition for the best actor awards which are coming his way. He is absorbed in the role of the stammering king who is timid, low in self-confidence, and frustrated but perfectly warm-hearted. The only time he doesn't stammer is oddly enough when he curses. This is something which his new speech therapist suggests he use as a practise tool in the one scene which earned the film an R rating. The King's Speech is arguably a proud moment for Geoffrey Rush as well. This is him at his best, and he and Firth together almost make the movie. Their exchange of dialogue is flawless.The King's Speech boasts an exceptional cast, which includes Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi and Guy Pearce, all of whom help contribute to the picture with the smallest amount of screen time.The King's Speech says a mouthful, and it warms the heart without question. There is also no question is arguing that it is among the very best of the year."
The Sixth Sense,1999,8.2,"After being shot by a resentful former patient whom he failed to help, a Philadelphia child psychologist seeks redemption by treating a young boy with a disturbing secret.","Reviewers say 'The Sixth Sense' is acclaimed for its iconic twist, altering film perception. Strong performances by Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis are highlighted. Central themes include fear, loss, and understanding. The eerie atmosphere, suspense, and emotional depth are frequently praised. Critics note its impact on the horror genre and influence on later movies. Some point to slow pacing and reliance on the twist as drawbacks. Overall, it is regarded as a well-crafted thriller blending psychological suspense with supernatural elements."
Platoon,1986,8.1,"Chris Taylor, a neophyte recruit in Vietnam, finds himself caught in a battle of wills between two sergeants, one good and the other evil. A shrewd examination of the brutality of war and the duality of man in conflict.","Reviewers say 'Platoon' is acclaimed for its realistic Vietnam War portrayal, highlighting soldiers' moral and psychological struggles. Oliver Stone's veteran experience enhances authenticity. The film is lauded for its gritty style and strong performances by Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger. However, some critics argue it oversimplifies moral issues and lacks historical accuracy. Its anti-war message is both praised and criticized for being simplistic and propagandistic. Despite mixed views on artistic merit, 'Platoon' is recognized for its emotional impact and resonance."
Kill Bill,2003,8.2,"After waking from a four-year coma, a former assassin wreaks vengeance on the team of assassins who betrayed her.","Reviewers say 'Kill Bill' is acclaimed for its stylized action, dynamic fight scenes, and genre-blending approach. Tarantino's direction and Thurman's performance are praised, along with the eclectic soundtrack and vibrant visuals. However, some find the violence excessive and the narrative simplistic. The film is seen as bold and visually striking, though it divides opinions on artistic merit and storytelling."
V for Vendetta,2005,8.1,"In a future British dystopian society, a shadowy freedom fighter, known only by the alias of ""V"", plots to overthrow the tyrannical government - with the help of a young woman.","Reviewers say 'V for Vendetta' is a thought-provoking film exploring oppression, freedom, and rebellion. Hugo Weaving's performance as V is highly praised, alongside the powerful script. However, the film's political views are criticized for being simplistic. Pacing issues and Evey's character development, portrayed by Natalie Portman, are also points of contention. Despite these criticisms, the movie is lauded for its visual style, action sequences, and its ability to stimulate discussion on political issues."
Annie Hall,1977,7.9,"Alvy Singer, a divorced Jewish comedian, reflects on his relationship with ex-lover Annie Hall, an aspiring nightclub singer, which ended abruptly just like his previous marriages.","Woody is an intelligent man who worries about the issues of film-making. The primary concern, the very first problem, is always to decide what the relationships are among the audience, the camera, the narrator if any, and the characters.Woody was on his way to making a murder mystery, which is the purest form of messing about with these relationships. In a much studied decision, they decided to cut out all the mystery and just focus on the context. In this case, that context is a richly layered evocation of a relationship. I really wish I could see the original film to discover the mysteries Woody intended to hide in the folds.And the folds are as numerous and complex as they can get. We have a framing device where Woody speaks to us partly as a conversation which blends into a standup, which is mirrored as a part of the story. We have timeshifting where we move back and forth in time in a simple 'Tarantino' way; but we go way past: characters from the 'present' enter the past as Dickensian ghosts, then they talk to characters in the past. we have characters in different pasts talking to each other via split screen. We have a layering of Woody and Diane's relationship in real life, then the film, then TWO films within: a play which is part of the action and a cartoon which is the action itself.More: we have Woody talking to the audience as if we were shifted into the play -- early in that play we are introduced to Bergman and Fellini: in both cases while they are waiting outside. These are the two inventors of folded narrative. Even more: while some bozo perfessor spouts off about Fellini and McLuhan, Woody enlists the audience to challenge him and drags out McLuhan himself! The joke of course is that McLuhan himself was a vapid weaver of lowbrow theories.And more and more with the constant weaving of 'analysis' and other film-like activities: singers, photographers, TeeVee stars, models...This period was when he was first exposed to Wallace Shawn who was hanging out with Terrence Malick, two other innovators in narrative folding. All the 'New Yorker' stuff means more when you know Shawn's father was the long-time editor of that publication and defined the self-absorbed reflection that characterizes the city and this film.Keaton's manner was essential to pulling this off, someone who could pull off the story about her uncle dying while waiting for a Turkey. Watch her.. she is clued in to simultaneously being in herself (Keaton), herself (Hall), inside the story she is telling and inside the story Woody is telling. She shifts and guffaws just as if she were stoned and moving among realities, just as her character.Just amazing and intelligent. Will we ever see this the way it was written and shot? Or is that mystery too intelligent for us, who prefer to think of this as a funny, endearing love story."
The Wizard of Oz,1939,8.1,"Young Dorothy Gale and her dog Toto are swept away by a tornado from their Kansas farm to the magical Land of Oz and embark on a quest with three new friends to see the Wizard, who can return her to her home and fulfill the others' wishes.","Reviewers say 'The Wizard of Oz' is cherished for its themes of home, friendship, and self-discovery. Judy Garland's performance and ""Over the Rainbow"" are celebrated. The black and white to Technicolor transition is noted for its impact. Characters like the Scarecrow and Tin Man symbolize personal growth. The film's cultural significance and moral lessons resonate across ages. Some critique its allegorical elements and societal reflections. Though dated, the special effects and set designs are admired for their creativity and era-specific impact."
Finding Nemo,2003,8.2,"After his son is captured in the Great Barrier Reef and taken to Sydney, a timid clownfish sets out on a journey to bring him home.","Reviewers say 'Finding Nemo' is acclaimed for its breathtaking animation and vibrant underwater world. The story of a father's journey to find his son resonates deeply, emphasizing themes of family, friendship, and perseverance. Humor, especially through characters like Dory, adds a delightful layer. The film's emotional depth and memorable music enhance its appeal. While some find it formulaic, 'Finding Nemo' remains a beloved classic with universal charm."
Ben Hur,1959,8.1,"A Jewish prince is betrayed and sent into slavery by a Roman friend in 1st-century Jerusalem, but it's not long before he regains his freedom and comes back for revenge.","Reviewers say 'Ben-Hur' is celebrated for its grand scale, stunning visuals, and iconic chariot race. Praised for production values, cinematography, and performances by Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd, it explores themes of revenge, forgiveness, and faith. However, some find it overly long with pacing issues and underdeveloped subplots. Despite mixed opinions on narrative and runtime, 'Ben-Hur' remains a significant and influential film in Hollywood history."
Black Swan,2010,8.0,"Nina is a talented but unstable ballerina on the verge of stardom. Pushed to the breaking point by her artistic director and a seductive rival, Nina's grip on reality slips, plunging her into a waking nightmare.","Reviewers say 'Black Swan' is acclaimed for its psychological drama, with Natalie Portman's compelling performance as a ballerina. The film delves into obsession, perfection, and duality, using visual elements like colors and mirrors. Critics praise the choreography and ballet portrayal, though some find horror elements overdone. The supporting cast enhances the atmosphere, making 'Black Swan' notable for its bold storytelling despite mixed opinions on certain aspects."
Rocky,1976,8.1,A small-time Philadelphia boxer gets a supremely rare chance to fight the world heavyweight champion in a bout in which he strives to go the distance for his self-respect.,"Reviewers say 'Rocky' is lauded for its inspirational narrative, emphasizing perseverance and the American Dream. Sylvester Stallone's performance as Rocky Balboa is highly praised, alongside the iconic training montage and Art Museum steps run. The love story between Rocky and Adrian adds emotional depth. Despite critiques on pacing, dialogue, and predictability, the film's emotional impact and cultural significance are widely recognized. The memorable soundtrack enhances its resonance."
District 9,2009,7.9,"In a future Earth in which aliens are isolated in a remote ghetto, a government agent finds himself banished there.","This movie different from the rest of the Alien movies. Though the gross awful looking aliens creeps me out most of the time at but that doesn't distract me from enjoying this the unique story. It kept at the edge of the seat whole time. It surprises, saddens, and amazes me at the same time. I never imagined this movie would end in this way."
The Terminator,1984,8.1,A cyborg assassin from the future attempts to find and kill a young woman who is destined to give birth to a warrior that will lead a resistance to save humankind from extinction.,"Reviewers say 'The Terminator' is acclaimed for its inventive time travel and AI premise, pioneering special effects, and powerful performances, especially Arnold Schwarzenegger's menacing cyborg. The film's dark, tech-noir ambiance, gripping storyline, and Sarah Connor's evolution from a naive waitress to a formidable guardian are often lauded. Its examination of fate versus free will and the consequences of cutting-edge technology strikes a chord with viewers, solidifying its status as a sci-fi classic."
Star Trek: The Future Begins,2009,7.9,The brash James T. Kirk tries to live up to his father's legacy with Mr. Spock keeping him in check as a vengeful Romulan from the future creates black holes to destroy the Federation one planet at a time.,"For folks who dissed this movie, and the second, because it wasn't the Star Trek of yester year, get over it. Roddenbury rolling over in his grave? Oh, please. The events in the first movie somehow made all the other off-shoots impossible? Yikes! How does anything in this movie affect the series with Piccard, Janeway, etc.? Give it a break, eh?Yeah, both movies had some corny lines and one or two ridiculous scenarios (Spock and Uhura making out?), but the first two movies in this reboot were great fun. The actors were brilliant even when their lines weren't, the action decent. Was either movie award-worthy? No, but not every movie has to be in order to enjoy it. I wasn't disappointed. Both kept me very well entertained. Sometimes it's good just to sit back, relax, enjoy, and not take everything so damn seriously.Now, the third installment is altogether another matter. While it did have its moments, it was really terribly written. There is a limit to how much even good actors can do with pervasively bad lines, and how much slop a viewer can put up with. And if Hollywood doesn't stop with their ""wokeness"", I think I'll have to stick with foreign flicks."
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,2003,8.1,"Blacksmith Will Turner teams up with eccentric pirate ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow to save Elizabeth Swann, the governor's daughter and his love, from Jack's former pirate allies, who are now undead.","Reviewers say 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' is acclaimed for its adventurous spirit, humor, and fantasy elements. Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow is lauded for charisma and originality. Special effects, especially cursed pirates and ship scenes, are highly regarded. The cast's chemistry, including Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, enriches the narrative. Yet, some note pacing issues, plot inconsistencies, and CGI overuse. Despite these, the film is celebrated for entertainment, memorable characters, and pirate genre revival."
Belle en het Beest,1991,8.0,A prince cursed to spend his days as a hideous monster sets out to regain his humanity by earning a young woman's love.,"Who can resist this beautiful story? I love the fact that even though Belle hated Beast at first, she saw underneath that he was a kind and gentle soul, and didn't care what he looked like on the outside! And what girl hasn't known a Gaston in their lives? I thought it was so great how he was put in his place! All the voiceovers are amazing, especially Robby Benson as Beast. Another Disney masterpiece."
The Truman Show,1998,8.2,An insurance salesman begins to suspect that his whole life is actually some sort of reality TV show.,"Reviewers say 'The Truman Show' is acclaimed for its innovative concept and profound themes like media manipulation and consumerism. Jim Carrey's performance is celebrated for its depth, while Peter Weir's direction and Andrew Niccol's screenplay are praised for creativity. The film's satire on reality TV and societal norms is appreciated, though some find the plot predictable. Cinematography and hidden cameras enhance realism and suspense. Despite minor critiques, it is seen as a significant cinematic work."
Ratatouille,2007,8.1,A rat who can cook makes an unusual alliance with a young kitchen worker at a famous Paris restaurant.,"Reviewers say 'Ratatouille' received widespread acclaim for its animation, storytelling, and voice acting, especially Peter O'Toole's performance as Anton Ego. Critics praised its unique premise, emotional depth, and technical achievements, considering it one of Pixar's finest works. However, some found the story predictable and the humor less effective compared to other Pixar films."
Rain Man,1988,8.0,"After a selfish L.A. yuppie learns his estranged father left a fortune to an autistic-savant brother in Ohio that he didn't know existed, he absconds with his brother and sets out across the country, hoping to gain a larger inheritance.","Dustin Hoffman's performance as Raymond Babbitt is,bar none,the best acting performance I have ever seen.I have never seen an actor get so deeply immersed in a character than Hoffman does in this film.He is excellent here,and he deserved nothing less than the Oscar he won for it.As for Tom Cruise,his performance as Raymond's childish and hotheaded brother is also worthy of note.To watch his character slowly shed his ignorance throughout the course of the film was indeed a delight.If you have not seen it,don't deprive yourself any longer.Buy it.It's a keeper."
Shutter Island,2010,8.2,Two US marshals are sent to a mental institution on an inhospitable island in order to investigate the disappearance of a patient.,"Reviewers say 'Shutter Island' is lauded for its suspenseful atmosphere, intricate plot, and standout performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Ben Kingsley. The film delves into themes of guilt, grief, and reality. However, some find the plot convoluted and the twist predictable. Critics also note slow pacing and excessive length. Despite these issues, many praise Martin Scorsese's direction and the film's striking visual style."
Big Fish,2003,8.0,A frustrated son tries to determine the fact from fiction in his dying father's life.,"It was either ""Cheaper by the Dozen,"" ""The Haunted Mansion"" or this. I didn't exactly feel like watching my favorite comedian run around with a horde of little kids cracking bad poopy jokes behind them, and I didn't want to see Eddie Murphy do this either (it was bad enough in last year's ""Daddy Day Care""), so I chose to see the more adult-oriented of these three films, and I'm glad I did, because Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"" is a marvelous film--full of wit and imagination and eerie vibes that sometimes don't fit into Burton's films the way he wants them to--but actually have a purpose here.""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"" is simply one of the best films of all time, and you can quote me on that. That was Burton's breakthrough--then came ""Batman,"" which was very good but slightly lacking in substance, and then came ""Edward Scissorhands""--one of my sister's favorite films, a beautiful love story and an eerie fable...but just missing a very small ingredient that kept it from becoming a great movie (perhaps the same with his film ""Ed Wood""--a very good film, but not exactly one of my all-time favorites).I have my doubts as to whether anyone other than Tim Burton could have pulled off ""Big Fish."" Here's a movie I expected I would dislike and come away feeling a little bit empty--but that's only partially true. The movie doesn't quite exceed on the level it tries to, but as a film, it's one of the best motion pictures of the year.It stars Albert Finney as Edward Bloom, an old man who loves to exaggerate tales of his past and pass these on to his friends and family. One night his son, William (Billy Crudup), tires of hearing the story about how he caught the town's largest fish in a lake using a gold ring--so he ignores his father for three whole years, until his mother (Jessica Lange) informs Will that his father is dying of cancer, and that he wishes to speak with his son one last time.Drawn back to his old Alabama hometown with his new wife, Will finally learns the truth about these so-called ""exaggerated"" stories--and we, as the audience, get to see them in flashback mode. It begins with a young Edward (Ewan McGregor), a ""big fish"" who was just too small for his own town and had to move away to search for brighter prospects. On his journey he comes across an assortment of odd fellows, including a ""Gentle Giant,"" a failed poet living in a heavenly town named Spectre, and a strange circus ringleader who also happens to be a werewolf.All of these stories that Edward Senior tells his family relate to their current positions, and to call the film simply beautiful would be what John Candy once said is ""the understatement of the year."" My particular favorite character was the poet living in Spectre, played by Steve Buscemi (a wonderful supporting actor), who I had no idea played any role in this film prior to viewing the opening credits and seeing ""with Steve Buscemi"" appear on screen.Buscemi's poet has been working on a particular poem for twelve years whilst living in Spectre. ""Can I see it?"" asks Edward. It says, ""Roses are red, violets are blue, I love Spectre."" ""But it's only three lines long!"" says Edward. ""That's the reason you don't show your work to people,"" Buscemi says.Danny DeVito also appears as the circus ringleader, and the most regretful scene in the film is that in which we see him naked from behind. I shudder at the thought. But, for what it's worth, DeVito's second re-teaming with Burton is magnificent--he's a supporting character, but the film certainly benefits from his performance.Like all of Burton's films, ""Big Fish"" teeters on the edge of greatness, but it never quite crosses the line. This is a marvelous film, full of warmth, kind-hearted fables and beautiful cinematography, and it's one of the best films of the year. It's certainly a unique film experience unlike any you've ever had before. Unless, of course, you've seen ""Edward Scissorhands"" or ""Ed Wood."" Then some of it may look a bit familiar.Still, I enjoyed it more than ""The Lord of the Rings."" And I could actually relate to this film.Trivia note: ""Edward Scissorhands"" was a Tim Burton film. The main character of this film is named Edward. Sometimes when people pronounce his name with their thick Alabama accents it comes across as ""Ed Wood."" Mere coincidence or something more? We may never find out.4.5/5 stars.John Ulmer"
"Monsters, Inc.",2001,8.1,"In order to power the city, monsters have to scare children so that they scream. However, the children are toxic to the monsters, and after a child gets through, two monsters realize things may not be what they think.","Reviewers say 'Monsters, Inc.' impresses with its imaginative premise and strong voice acting by John Goodman and Billy Crystal. The animation is praised for its realistic depiction of monster fur and movement. The story, exploring themes of friendship, acceptance, and laughter, resonates deeply. Characters Sulley and Mike are charming and well-developed. The film's humor and emotional moments enhance its lasting appeal, though some find the plot slightly predictable. Overall, it's a beloved classic with memorable moments and a heartwarming message."
The Matrix Reloaded,2003,7.2,"Freedom fighters Neo, Trinity and Morpheus continue to lead the revolt against the Machine Army, unleashing their arsenal of extraordinary skills and weaponry against the systematic forces of repression and exploitation.","The Matrix Reloaded has everything you could possibly want from a summer blockbuster but it like its predecessor has a heck of a lot more and while Reloaded is not as good as the first Matrix film it sure is close to the standard of the original. I don't understand the seeming reluctance to accept this film a suitable continuation of the original film. I'll be the first one to admit that Reloaded has a few slow points and that the story line has a tendency towards the pretentious but the film is also highly intelligent and entertaining but most importantly the film gets the story from A to B with adequate and in some cases remarkable character development.Acting wise the film is in the same kind of league as the first film of the series with a few mediocre performances, a few decent performances and one or two excellent performances. Keanu Reeves plays Neo pretty much like he did in the first movie and that is not bad. His monotone voice is canceled out by his clear and well defined body language. His overall performance is very fitting for the character which, lets face it, is somewhat square and Keanu's acting fits that kind of character very well. Carrie-Anne Moss has taken a small step down. I don't blame her as much as I blame the writing. Her character, while still ass-kicking, is too dependent on Neo. I know they love each other but come on. Laurence Fishbourne shines as Morpheus. His performance is slightly more stylized than in the first film but he steals almost every scene he is in. Other semi-known actors make glorified cameos. Actors like Jada Pinkett Smith, Monica Bellucci and Lambert Wilson are great examples. Gloria Foster returns as the Oracle in her (sadly) last performance as she died during the filming. Her one brief scene is both highly interesting and well acted. As it was with the first film Hugo Weaving provides the best acting by far. Although his screen time is somewhat limited he manages to leave a lasting impression and becomes one of my favorite screen baddies of all time. His performance is for lack of a better word fantastic.Effect wise Reloaded is a feast. There is literally something to look at in every scene. The ""real"" world has been given a face lift to make it more interesting. The real effects, however, take place inside the matrix and just like in the first film the effects are absolutely ground breaking. Rivaling the likes of Star Wars and LotR and that is saying something. The people who think the story is pretentious and the dialog stubby will undoubtedly get their adrenaline fix in the action scenes. Some scenes had me holding my breath and gasping at how beautiful and overwhelming it all was and as much as I love the philosophical aspects of the film I can watch it for the effects themselves as well. Without spoiling anything I can say that lovers of cool fight scenes and fx are in for a hell of a treat with this one.In terms of costumes the film has really grown into its own. Especially Neo's costume in The Matrix is very cool and is a great improvement over the previous film. Morpheus' and Trinity's costumes are the same with minor changes and they still look cool. Agent Smith's costume has changed slightly in the color scheme. His suit has become a bit darker as if to signify that he is no longer an Agent of the system but a rogue agent now. Also his sunglasses have changed so that they look more rounded so they look more like Neo's sunglasses which of course implicates their connection. Many of the secondary characters have their own costumes as well mirroring their own personalities.Were the film separated itself from other action packed films is of course in the underlying philosophical and religious aspects. Once the film has been watched a few times for the effects you can begin to see some of the elements. I don't think its possible to fully translate and analyze every element of the film. Mainly because every element can be analyzed in a bunch of different ways. Without spoiling too much I can say that if you look hard enough you will be able to find Plato, Baudrillard, Gnosticism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Christian elements and some more. The people who tell matrix lovers to get a life for searching the Matrix for a deeper meaning ought to open their eyes and watch the film one more time. With that I'm not saying that you can't be intelligent if you don't like the Matrix I am simply asking you to give it another chance. You really won't regret it.The Matrix Reloaded is an excellent film and it deserves a lot more respect than it is getting and it is definitely underrated. I don't expect people to agree but I do expect people to respect those who love the Matrix sequels like me. I for one think that its hard to go wrong with Reloaded as it is funny, moving, awe-inspiring and very intelligent. I highly recommend this film to anyone.9/10"
American Gangster,2007,7.8,An outcast New York City cop is charged with bringing down Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas.,"Scott managed to weave two stories together into an epic crime drama. Washington rules the screen with each scene he's in and Crowe is solid, if not spectacular.
Other than those two, this film is much more about the story that it is the characters. Still, this film is highly entertaining if not a bit lengthy."
Taxi Driver,1976,8.2,"A mentally unstable veteran works as a nighttime taxi driver in New York City, where the perceived decadence and sleaze fuels his urge for violent action.","Not only one of Scorsese's best films, but one of the best of the 70s. It is very hard hitting, dark and still has the resonance and power to shock. The cinematography is measured and chilly, yet very atmospheric, while Bernard Hermann's swansong score is superb, yet more proof at how amazing a composer he was. The story is unsettling but wonderfully told, and the script is brilliantly written. Scorcese also directs impeccably, while the acting is just excellent. Robert DeNiro gives one of his best performances, the whole film is worth watching just for his performance, that's how good it is, but that's not to dismiss Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel and Cybill Sheppard in the supporting cast for they are just as good while Scorsese's own cameo is genuinely frightening. There you have it, another one of Scorsese's best with a brilliant atmosphere and mesmerising central performance. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
The Dirty Dozen,1967,7.7,"During World War II, a rebellious U.S. Army Major is assigned a dozen convicted murderers to train and lead them into a mass assassination mission of German officers.","A generally entertaining war film with no real political axe to grind  or patriotic flagwaving getting in the way.  Its very dangerous trying to humourise war in the movies, because that  would be offensive to all those that had served & died in real life.  Kelly's Heroes and 1941 probably went a little too far, pretending that  war is really fun & cool when you've got people like Clint Eastwood in  charge.  But then you have other war films that are black in its humour but  manage to keep into focus the cruelty & horrors of war at the same time  - M*A*S*H and Catch 22 are the best examples.  With Dirty Dozen we have something of a go-between; the humour amongst  the characters is light & welcoming but never falls into farce or  bad-taste; and Aldrich quickly pulls us back into the fold with some  tight scripted scenes of drama & mass murder (throwing petrol &  grenades into that German bunker to name but one. I often wonder about  that scene, and whether it was some kind of metaphor for the gas  chambers & concentration camps in Belsen)  But unlike MASH & Catch 22, Aldrich resists the temptation to openly  politicise the effects of war, after all this film was made in '67 near  the height of the Vietnam war/protests. Instead he takes a straight  line course of action and lets us be moved & entertained by the  convicted GIs doing their duty.  Marvin is excellent as the hardnosed but disobediant Major. He plays  the anti-hero far better than Eastwood in Kelly's Heroes. Marvin just  looks the type who'd give the top brass as well the Germans a real hard  time.  But special mention must go to Cassavettes as Viktor Franko, the  trouble-maker's trouble-maker. His character is so refreshing & wild  amongst a relatively mild cast of supporting extras, with the exception  of Savalas. Franko is the Joker of the pack but you soon feel an  attachment for him in spite of his crimes.  Sutherland & Bronson, don't really add much. The former plays a  slightly naive man who hasn't really grown up and Bronson just smirks &  mumbles a lot.  The only other character worthy of a mention is the truly terrifying  Savalas, who is a Christian through & through, yet hates all women as  much as the Germans; and has a most spine chilling laugh! Difficult to  believe this man later became Kojak!  The film is a tad overlong; the first & last 40 minutes hold the  interest but the middle section (the War Games scene), is far too long  and generally detracts.  All the same, DD is a very good movie, especially for those who don't  want to be politically moralised too.  ***/*****"
Jurassic Park,1993,8.2,"An industrialist invites some experts to visit his theme park of cloned dinosaurs. After a power failure, the creatures run loose, putting everyone's lives, including his grandchildren's, in danger.","Reviewers say 'Jurassic Park' is acclaimed for its revolutionary special effects and realistic dinosaur portrayal. Steven Spielberg's direction is lauded for crafting suspense and wonder, delivering a thrilling experience. Performances by Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum are noted for authenticity. John Williams' score enhances emotional impact, contributing to the film's success. The blend of practical effects and CGI is praised for seamless integration, ensuring lasting appeal. The cautionary tale about unchecked scientific advancement adds thematic depth, resonating with audiences."
Lethal Weapon,1987,7.6,Two newly paired cops who are complete opposites must put aside their differences in order to catch a gang of drug smugglers.,"One more year until Die Hard that set all the clich√©s for future action pics. Until then, you'll just have to settle for Lethal Weapon, the movie that set the buddy-cop clich√©s. And that's not necessarily a bad thing.What a fantastically realistic, original and fun movie the original Lethal Weapon movie was. In addition, it broke barriers by adding a lot of subliminal ""Can't we all just get along"" messages. Some less obvious than others and some in your face, like making the two ""opposite cop partners"" white and black. (Later in the series, they shove ""Save the Dolphin"" messages down our throats.) Still reeling in his wife's untimely demise, excellent/top notch/Jack Bauer Detective Riggs (Gibson) is suicidal, a la a ""lethal weapon"" and is teamed with over-the-hill Murtaugh (Glover) to solve a case involving someone in Murtaugh's war-laced past. They don't get along, have totally different personalities and must learn to work together for their common goal: justice. By means of¬Öfists and gunpowder, for the most part.A lot of this sounds eerily familiar and predictable. And it is¬Öfor someone watching this for the first time today. But, again, this is the movie that set the standards. You'll have to thank this movie for the countless, and I mean countless, like in the hundreds, of rip-offs. Thankfully, this beginning of the ""new age"" buddy movie was very well done, but not without its flaws.It is said that the majority (if not all) of the Lethal Weapon films are improv'ed. Sure, they had somewhat of a script, but for the most part, the actors just did there thing. 90% of the time, it worked. When it didn't, it was slow and a little bit too realistic, like you were watching a dysfunctional family or cop partners on TruTV. Thankfully, that was only 10%.My parents took me to Lethal Weapon 2 in 1989. I was 14 and was allowed in due to being accompanied by adults. I had yet to see the original for years to come. I fell madly in love with part two. Unfortunately, once I was able to see this, I was disappointed as it was not as action-packed or funny as part 2. That said, this is still worth watching. You will see excellent acting by Gibson, the iconic Busey of the 1980s and the origin of the buddy-cop movies to follow. Absolutely recommended."
Kill Bill 2,2004,8.0,"The Bride continues her quest of vengeance against her former boss and lover Bill, the reclusive bouncer Budd, and the treacherous, one-eyed Elle.","Over the last 40 years, I've seen a lot of movies. All types. Some great, some good and some mostly inedible; most left my breath with a sour smell. Westerns, sci-fi, comedies, dramas, etc. After seeing Kill Bill Vol I, I assumed that any sequel would pale to its predecessor. I, of course, was premature in my prediction. The movie was, by all means, a classic. I feel Taratino was really trying to make a great movie versus making money for his producers. To build his tasty sandwich, he took the lessons he learned from life as a movie maker and cleverly managed to meld some slices of meat from Sergio Leone (subtly), Akira Kurosawa (very subtly) and, I'm stretching it here, Ridley Scott, to create a great sequel to an excellent first movie. He used some great, almost forgotten actors (Daryl Hannah, Micheal Parks, and David Carradine to create a memorable meal. It was only a sandwich, but what morsel it was. I was full and wanting more. Very rare to find this type of film in our corporate world. He must wield some real power in the movie world. I don't know of anyone who has saw this movie who hasn't given it great feedback. And I know all types of viewers. My wife, who really doesn't like anything that is not overly melancholy or dripping with sentimentality, actually liked the whole movie. That in itself is an endorsement. Well done. Mr. Tarantino, you will be hard placed to match this gem."
Aliens,1986,8.4,"Decades after surviving the Nostromo incident, Ellen Ripley is sent out to re-establish contact with a terraforming colony but finds herself battling the Alien Queen and her offspring.","Reviewers say 'Aliens' is celebrated for its intense action, enhanced visuals, and Sigourney Weaver's compelling performance as Ripley. The film's fusion of sci-fi, horror, and war elements is widely appreciated. However, some critics feel it falls short in psychological depth compared to the original 'Alien', with less menacing xenomorphs. The plot's predictability and stereotypical marine characters also draw criticism. Nonetheless, 'Aliens' is commonly seen as a notable sequel that enriches the original's universe."
Die Hard 2,1990,7.2,"John McClane must race against time to save hundreds of lives (including his wife's) when a group of terrorists take control of Washington Dulles Airport's systems, and threaten to crash several planes if their demands are not met.","John McClane is in Washington to meet his wife as she arrives at the airport.  However as he waits for her plane to come in terrorists seize control of the control equipment and keep the planes circling.  They plan to rescue captured dictator General Esperanza by landing his plane at the airport and making their escape.  However as the terrorists wait the circling planes get shorter and shorter on fuel, leading John McClane to take what action he can to regain control of the planes.This second of the exciting die hard series has a hard act to follow.  The first film was amazing and broke the mould relating to action films, it showed that action could occur in everyday locations, caused English actors to get lots of work as bad guys and set many other copycat films in motion (die hard on a mountain, die hard on a bus etc).  However this is nothing special.  The plot tries to be similar to the original but it lacks as much originality as the first.  The terrorist plot is not quite as likely and it doesn't have the same flow as the first.  Story-wise the main flaw is in McClane's involvement - in the first film he was very much trapped and forced to take action, in fact his first instinct was to run away from the terrorists.  Here the same is not true, Willis tries to make it seem that he doesn't want all this again (""how can the same **** happen to the same guy"") but really he throws himself into the thick of the battle.  This takes away from the image of him as an ordinary guy put into a difficult situation.The action scenes don't help this problem.  Yes all the action scenes are good and exciting, but many of them are too big.  In the first the action occurred in short standoffs, usually with McClane running away or sneaking around.  Here there's too many of one man v's the world style action with Willis running in against a large number of terrorists and winning.  Again this takes away from the tension and claustrophobia of the other film and makes it feel like a Arnie blockbuster.  That said the action is still good and won't disappoint action fans.The main failing of the film is that it tries to be like the first film without success.  It retains the same set-up (McClane trying to rescue his wife from terrorists), brings back the same Christmas time setting and music, it even wheels back in as many repeat characters as it can (Veljohnson as Sergeant Powell, Atherton as Thornburg) but it loses the most important item - the set parameters of the action.  Die Hard was great because it had very tightly set locations for it's action in the office block.  Here the action can spread out all over so a lot of the tension and claustrophobia is lost.  The decision to make the second film so similar to the first can only lead us to comparing the two and seeing the inferiorities.The performances are quite good generally.  Willis can almost do this type of thing in his sleep while the other repeat characters simply redo their roles.  Unfortunately many of the repeat characters don't have much to do and seem out of place.  The 'new' characters fill the stereotyped shoes of previous actors.  Dennis Franz takes on the mantle of incompetent cop standing in McClane's way by going by the book, Sheila McCarthy takes on the story hungry journalist role etc.  The bad guys do have a lot to live up to by replacing Alan Rickman and they don't quite reach that standard.  William Sadler is good as Colonel Stuart but doesn't have any style of his own, anyway it's good to see Franco Nero (cult star of western Django) in an American film.The film has some nice twists towards the end but it just doesn't come close to the atmosphere of the first film.  By trying to be similar to the first film, Renny Harlin shows that he's not as capable as McTiernan in creating a mood of tension mixed with the action.  The result is a great action movie but one that cowers in the shadow of it's better bigger brother."
Die Hard with a Vengeance,1995,7.6,"John McClane is forced out of suspension to play a game of ""Simon Says"" by a terrorist who has planted bombs all around New York City and will detonate them if McClane doesn't do what he says.","Regardless of what you might think of Bruce Willis, he really does excel in this series of films and John McClane, the all action policeman is the perfect role for him.This time his sidekick is the guru of the action film, Samuel L. Jackson, the owner of an electrical store, as he goes up against the ever excellent Jeremy irons, who can play a bad guy like few others.Irons is executing the greatest heist ever, and the shots throughout the film are spectacular.  The lack of any half decent script is completely masked by explosions, but what else would you expect?"
Surrogates,2009,6.3,"Set in a futuristic world where humans live in isolation and interact through surrogate robots, a cop is forced to leave his home for the first time in years in order to investigate the murders of others' surrogates.","Finally saw this and I'm with the majority here... a solid 7/10 film.This surprisingly compelling sci-fi film takes a while to set up its universe but delivers down the stretch. It's borderline whether they establish enough credibility so as to invest real emotion in to the characters and buy in to the premise. If you allow yourself to buy in to the bizarre concept of living life through android duplicates, then the film works on a few levels. It's somewhat weak on certain of those levels but raises interesting questions concerning the level of our technological dependency as we live our lives. The emotional aspect of this movie plays better thanks to a fine performance by Bruce Willis. His character's journey through this bizarre world is obviously the heart of the film and it's written and portrayed very well."
X-Men 2,2003,7.4,"When anti-mutant Colonel William Stryker kidnaps Professor X and attacks his school, the X-Men must ally with their archenemy Magneto to stop him.","Reviewers say 'X2: X-Men United' directed by Bryan Singer is acclaimed for its dynamic action sequences, deep character development, and thematic complexity. Singer brings a distinctive visual style and emotional depth to the X-Men series. While some critics note pacing issues and over-the-top moments, the majority appreciate the film's engaging narrative and strong performances, particularly from Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellen."
The Running Man,1987,6.6,"In a future dystopian America, a wrongfully accused and convicted policeman gets his shot at freedom when he's forced to participate in a TV game show where convicts called Runners must battle killers for their freedom.","Reviewers say 'The Running Man' is an action-packed, satirical film exploring reality TV and media manipulation. It highlights dangers of media control and societal obsession with violence. Schwarzenegger's performance and one-liners are praised, though some critique his acting. The dystopian setting and prophetic elements are appreciated, but the film is criticized for prioritizing action over story, clunky dialogue, and unrealistic plot points. Despite flaws, it's seen as entertaining and a cult classic."
Deja Vu,2006,7.1,"After a ferry is bombed in New Orleans, an A.T.F. agent joins a unique investigation using experimental surveillance technology to find the bomber, but soon finds himself becoming obsessed with one of the victims.","It's a real shame that everything I had read about D√©j√† Vu concerned the high-powered explosions and loud clatter of guru/producer Jerry Bruckheimer. No mention, except maybe as a footnote, was given to A-list director Tony Scott and the magic he has woven in his past three films. The man who brought us Top Gun has seen a sort of revival in style lately with the entertaining Spy Game, the amazing Man on Fire, and the kinetic Domino. Scott has taken the quick cuts of music videos and has infused them into his shooting style. His editor better be making some good money as these films fly by with filters, jump-cuts, grain, and camera angles swiveling at every turn. Greatly overshadowed by brother Ridley Scott and his more serious, award-winning epics, Tony has been pumping out some of the most solid and entertaining films of the past couple decades. With a reuniting of semi-regular star Denzel Washington, D√©j√† Vu proves that when Bruckheimer is paired with a like mind, his usual drivel can become great. Scott shows us how to hone the explosions, noise, and clutter to an effective level and gives us a helluva ride.D√©j√† Vu could have easily reduced itself to timetravel farce, going by the books to show a time warp in order to solve a crime. The far-fetched premise of being able to see the past as it happens four and a half days later should seem crazy and by watching the previews you are given the idea that it will be just a series of do-overs. Fortunately the trailers these days show a totally different movie than what has been crafted. Scott and his screenwriters have not only developed a sci-fi tale seeped in enough reality to at least be looked upon as plausible for the sake of the story, but they nicely tidy up any chance of their being a plothole. Our story begins with a devastating domestic terrorist act upon a ferry carrying over 500 people, Navy and family. Washington's ATF agent is brought in and discovers that it was no accident. Intrigued by the efficiency he displays, an FBI agent, played with nicely effective restraint by Val Kilmer, calls him in to check out a new toy they have to find who the perpetrator is. During the use of this screen of the past, Denzel acquires a feeling of obligation to do all he can to prevent what he sees from occurring in the present, no matter what consequences that might entail for the future. The quest to stop the violence begins with an attractive young woman who unknowingly has become an integral part in what will ultimately transpire.The beauty of this film is that with multiple timelines being shown parallel to each other, there are many questions that desperately need answering. To credit all involved, they appear to have put themselves in the audience's shoes and piece-by-piece wrote in a reason for everything. Anything that is seen either in the past, present, or future has a reason for being there and will be intelligently explained. Also, the performances are stellar, Denzel and Kilmer as well as a quietly maniacal Jim Caviezel and the emotionally exasperated Paula Patton, and the visuals unique. While Scott has toned down the ultra-kinetic cuts and filters for the main action, his style is still stamped on the graphics of their screen showing the past. The motion trails and speed scans lend a stylized digital editing program feel and are gorgeous to watch. D√©j√† Vu's best sequence, however, is the crazy car chase during the present in pursuit of a vehicle in the past, definitely a rush and orchestrated almost flawlessly. Even though Ridley gets the accolades and Tony gets the hack/overproduced label, I must say, while they are the best directing duo in Hollywood, I might have to give the edge on pure cinematic entertainment to the younger Tony. He is on a roll and doesn't seem to be stopping anytime soon."
Die Hard 4.0,2007,7.1,"John McClane is forced to team up with a young computer hacker, Matt Farrell, to stop a master cyber-terrorist called Thomas Gabriel, who wants to shut down the entire nations computer infrastructure in a mass cyber attack.","'Die Hard 4.0 (2007)' is enjoyable in a different way to the prior titles in the series. It's a much more glossy action flick, still fun despite being heavily watered down and featuring a protagonist who's almost indestructible. Still, it essentially captures that 'Die Hard' spirit for most of its run-time and is rather entertaining throughout. 7/10"
X-Men: The Last Stand,2006,6.6,"The human government develops a cure for mutations, and Jean Grey becomes a darker uncontrollable persona called the Phoenix who allies with Magneto, causing escalation into an all-out battle for the X-Men.","Reviewers say 'X-Men: The Last Stand' is divisive, exploring themes of acceptance and humanity. Visual effects, action, and Ian McKellen's performance are praised. However, pacing, underdeveloped characters, and messy storytelling are criticized. New characters and subplots are seen as overwhelming. Deviations from the source material and character handling, especially Professor X and Jean Grey, are contentious. Some appreciate its ambition and final battle."
Rounders,1998,7.3,A law student and his pal gamble for high stakes.,"Rounders (1998)A charming idea, almost romanticized: if you are young, clever, good looking, and savvy at playing poker you can be ultra cool and maybe even wealthy. That makes for a pretty good movie, if not a very accurate reality. It isn't quite enough to keep two hours going, however, and so the big picture here is to enjoy what it has.A quick comparison might be made to ""The Hustler"" and related pool shark movies. And like that classic, ""Rounders"" is about charming deceit. Matt Damon is the main man here, an ex-poker champ who has ""gone straight"" until his former partner in crime, Ed Norton, gets out of jail and ropes him back into the thrills and malevolence. Like the pool movies, and like the glitzier and more ambitious ""Oceans"" movies, personalities matter most. The setting, the glint of money, and most of all the plots matter less than you'd think.So everything is pretty good along those lines, partly because Damon is fun to be with and Norton is simply terrific. An embarrassing appearance in the beginning and end of the movie by an overacting John Malkovich gets in the way of Damon's performance, however. And the general attempt at creating a bunch of bad guys behind the scenes is filled with thin clich√©s and mediocre acting.This is the result of having to make more of the story that was ever there. The main idea--that the two leads get into money trouble and have to earn a ton of cash in a few days of wild poker games--is eventually actually a bit of a bore. The gamesmanship is always interesting, of course, but the impetus behind it grows old. The addition of Martin Landau as a Jewish lawyer who gives Damon a mitzvah as a kind of honor paid to continue a favor once given him is a touching part of the larger plot, making you wish there was more of this somehow, more of something genuine and a bit different.It might not have helped that I recently saw ""Croupier"" with a young Clive Owen as a poker dealer, because that movie, whatever its simplicity and other limitations, actually made the poker scenes more real for me. In fact, one problem with ""Rounders"" is you never get to actually sense the betting itself, and the cards--the playing and the strategies of playing--are glossed over with some tossing of chips and flipping of cards, all in a vague muddle.I did enjoy watching overall, but it left me a little disappointed and restless."
A Bronx Tale,1993,7.8,"An intense drama about a boy torn between his tough, hard-working father and a violent yet charismatic crime boss.","A Bronx Tale tells the story of a boy growing up in the Bronx that must face tough decisions between a mobster and his father the working man. Robert De Niro, in his directorial debut, shows an inside view of the mafia in the neighborhood and how an individual child idolize them just like the way the film GoodFellas showed how a kid wanted to be a gangster.Chazz Palminteri plays Sonny, the kingpin in the neighborhood, who is not only a feared man in the Bronx but also kills a man in the streets and Lorenzo's (Robert De Niro) son, Colgero, is the witness. Lorenzo's son doesn't rat on anybody and Sonny considers the kid an okay person where he'll take care of him like a father would for his son if he does certain favors that would make Lorenzo uncomfortable.Colgero sees different point of views from his two ""fathers"" where Lorenzo, his real father, is an honest bus driver who likes what he does in making a living prior to standing by in his codes of morality while Colgero sees Sonny as something of a hero since he's not a sucker like those who have to wait for bum paychecks where all he does is make a living by either killing or stealing where having power makes a man.As Colgero grows into a teenager in the 60's, both his real father (Lorenzo) and his idol (Sonny) want the best for him with different standards and don't want to see him in the wrong direction. At the same time Colgero falls in love with a woman, a young black girl, at his high school where interracial relationships is consider a no-no to both the black community and the Italian neighborhood. It doesn't bother Colgero one bit while asking both his father and idol for advice where he's growing up to be a man.""A Bronx Tale"" is not only a life lesson movie, but a coming of age story where not only does Colgero witness everything in front of him from death to prejudice but it's about how two men from separate worlds want the best for this kid."
Shrek the Third,2007,6.1,"Reluctantly designated as the heir to the land of Far, Far Away, Shrek hatches a plan to install the rebellious Artie as the new king while Princess Fiona tries to fend off a coup d'√©tat by the jilted Prince Charming.","The movie did not really hold the attention of my two younger kids. Even for me, the funny experience of watching both Shrek 1 and 2 was not really very evident with this installment. I remember in Shrek 2, I was laughing out loud with each passing pop culture reference and innuendo being bantered around. However, that was not so here.I was not too amused with the Disney princesses characters. Shrek's ""baby nightmare scene"" was well-executed. Justin Timberlake did well in voicing his ""grovelling at Merlin's feet"" scene. Overall, this movie was not that bad, but it needed to be much better to be worthy to stand on the same level as the first two Shrek films."
Keizer Kuzco,2000,7.4,"Emperor Kuzco is turned into a llama by his ex-administrator Yzma, and must now regain his throne and his human form with the help of Pacha, a gentle llama herder.","How great is this? A movie about a talking lama. I absolutely love this movie, from beginning to end. I don't know how many times I have watched this movie, but I am guessing in the over 10 area. This is the only movie that I find funnier dubbed in Norwegian than in the original language. It is absolutely hilarious, I don't care what age you are. Although I think adults understands more of the jokes in the movie, but that doesn't mean that kids won't find it funny. The movie is a story of betrayal, friendship, love and lots and lots of humour. It doesn't seem like I can ever get tired of this movie. Why? Because it is absolutely fantastic! I am 24 years old, so there aren't any age boundaries here. I rate this movie 10/10"
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,1991,6.9,Robin Hood decides to fight back as an outlaw when faced with the tyranny of the Sheriff of Nottingham.,"Escaping death in Jerusalem, Robin of Locksley returns to his England home with Moor companion Azeem in tow. However he finds his home burnt to the ground, his father slandered and murdered and the poor marginalised to within an inch of their lives. Branded an outlaw by the evil Sheriff of Nottingham, Robin flees into Sherwood Forrest where he brings together a group of ragtag rebels ""led"" by a man called John Little. As his popularity grows, Robin becomes a massive thorn in the side of the Sheriff, forcing him to take harsher action.Younger viewers coming to this film on television may not appreciate that this film was made at a time when the presence of Kevin Costner was a bonus and indeed almost a selling point. Yes, I know this sounds like crazy talk from an older man who has seen too many movies to be good for him but it is true and Robin Hood is a fine example of a so-so film that was built partly on his star power. Of course the downside of this is that the film itself is not that good because it has his and others' names to let it carry it. The plot is well known but rather annoyingly touched with modernisms and Americanisms to the detriment of the telling (whether this be the accents, the errors or just the attitude). This also contributes to the lack of depth in the film and generally, although it looks slick, it doesn't provide anything in the way of emotional engagement ¬ñ despite the fact that it spawned the manipulative and saccharine Bryan Adams hit that seemed to taint everyone's wedding back in 1992.The direction is glossy but it cannot get to the heart of anything and Reynolds also fails to get that much out of his cast. As a result Costner simply trades on his rather stiff charm, occasionally enjoying himself but generally taking the whole thing too seriously. Rickman effortlessly dominates the film by chewing the scenery in each and every scene ¬ñ his colourful performance makes Costner (who can be good) look as stiff as a board. I've never seen the appeal of Mastrantonio at the best of times and this is not the best of times. She is dull and pretty poor all round. Freeman is a good face but is a modernisation too far. Slater is pointless although support from Wincott, Blessed, Brimble and a few others is good if not that great.Overall then this is a rather joyless spectacle but one that is glossy enough to perhaps do the job for undemanding viewers. It isn't that much fun and the attempts at emotional engagement are mostly cloying and sentimental. The cast are mixed but the only one able to inject life into the rather stiff material is Rickman, who easily livens his scenes but cannot carry the film. Worth a look if you are in a undemanding mood but just don't expect anything more than the blockbuster basics."
Shrek 2,2004,7.4,"Shrek and Fiona travel to the Kingdom of Far Far Away, where Fiona's parents are King and Queen, to celebrate their marriage. When they arrive, they find they are not as welcome as they thought they would be.","Ok, I have to admit that the surprise is gone. The original Shrek was irreverent and made fun of all the children stories known to man... The second one is on the same line but by now you expect it. Still it's been a long time since I've seen an entire theater laugh from the start till the end of a movie. Wonderful new characters (you have to love the pussy in boots), superb animation and a all-round well made movie for everyone to enjoy. But please, whatever you do DO NOT read any comments (like this one) before you go see the movie, it can ruin it for you... And watch the credits until the end, there are surprises... Enough said, just enjoy the film, it's guaranteed to make any blues just fade away!"
The Last Samurai,2003,7.8,"In 19th century Japan, Nathan Algren, a US army captain, is hired by the Japanese emperor to train his army in the modern warfare techniques. Captain Algren finds himself trapped in a struggle between two eras and two worlds.","""The Last Samurai"" 2003 and ""The Last of the Dogmen"" (1995 d: Tab Murphy, with Tom Berenger and Barbara Hershey in the lead) are both films with the theme of the 'last' of warrior spirits (one is Samurai, one is Cheyenne). The production of The Last Samurai is well worth seeing - the glory of a large-scale Hollywood production it is. From the research of the historical Japanese Meiji period, the mannerisms, the way different classes of people dress, the settings, the battle weapons and armory, how the Samurai train and fight, to the study and appreciation of the Art of War - where men of honor and integrity in service to the Emperor is the thing to die for. The film title in three Kanji characters means The Way of the Warrior (Samurai). The one character shown on screen at the very beginning (romanization: Sze) meant in the service of the King. Hence the definition of Watanabe's Samurai lifelong one true goal - to serve his Emperor, one and only, and to die in the service of the Emperor would be an honor.The film, directed by Ed Zwick, is truly a combined labor of love of everyone involved. From the producer-lead actor Tom Cruise and Zwick's film-making partner Marshall Herskovitz, cinematography by John Toll and film score by Hans Zimmer, to the costuming details, diverse casting, location scouting all the way to New Zealand and training of the supporting cast - even the official Web site with extensive production notes - all provide enhanced appreciation of this remarkable film. The storyline and drama of ""The Last Samurai"" evoke various level of emotions, pulling the heartstrings of the audience with high emotional energy - suspense, sadness, smiles, empathy, joy.""Kagemusha"" by Akira Kurosawa, of course, is the ultimate grandeur of a historic Samurai epic. ""The Last Samurai"" is comparable in drama and treatment if not with equal passionate efforts all round. Both are available on DVD with special features of audio commentary and the making of 'featurette' and more."
Shrek Forever After,2010,6.3,Rumpelstiltskin tricks a mid-life crisis burdened Shrek into allowing himself to be erased from existence and cast in a dark alternate timeline where Rumpelstiltskin rules supreme.,"After three films of diminishing quality, more than anything, Shrek Forever After begs the obvious question: why? Unfortunately the answer is also all too obvious with the franchise having grossed one billion dollars domestically and oodles more overseas. For what it's worth, this instalment is better than the last but fails to hold a candle to Shrek 2 and pales to the point of apparition when compared to the original.The characters that populate the ""Shrek"" universe remain as endearing as ever in principle, but after four movies there is little that can be done to keep them animated, so to speak. That is why it comes as no surprise that the plot of this film has the mythical land of Far Far Away being turned on its head by the devious Rumplestiltskin, morphing all familiarity into a bizzaro world of sort, and I'll admit, it does add an iota of charm to the proceedings. Shrek (Mike Myers) finds himself tired of family life with his ogre wife Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and longs for his bachelor days of terrifying townsfolk and signs a contract with 'Rumple' as he is less than affectionately called. Things don't turn out nearly as he imagined and Shrek must fulfil a loophole in the contract to turn things back to the way they were.The original gang all return along with Shrek and Fiona. We have the swashbuckling Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas), the chatty Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Julie Andrews and John Cleese as the Queen and King respectively. There are also a number of celebrity voice cameos including Larry King and Regis Philbin and all add up to a lively time at the movies. In the movies defence, the lack of freshness never translates to boredom.The biggest issue with Shrek the Third was the weak attempt to inflate the voice cast, making things more monotonous yet. DreamWorks has clearly learned from this mistake and in addition to tweaking the familiar character's personas in this alternate reality, find a decent villain in Rumplestiltskin (Walt Dohrn) along with great comedians the likes of Craig Robinson and Jane Lynch. The animation is as stellar as ever and it never ceases to amaze how lifelike a film can look that has a talking donkey at its center.What makes this descendant of Shrek somewhat distinguishable is that it presents itself more as homage then adhering to the spoof ideology that characterized the others. Shrek Forever After is part Aladdin, part Bedazzled and more than a sprinkle of It's a Wonderful Life. There are also many more laughs in this film than the previous, and can often be attributed to site gags sprung from the new universe (an obese Puss in Boots provokes more than a few guffaws).What everyone has to remember, first and foremost, is that the ""Shrek"" franchise is meant for children and I don't believe any of the four instalments could disappoint an eight year old. It is the accompanying adults that need to be wary of the growing tedium in the franchise, but thanks to a plethora of talented actors and a significantly more satisfying storyline, Shrek Forever After makes for an entertaining diversion, even if it's no longer magical."
Jerry Maguire,1996,7.3,"When a sports agent has a moral epiphany and is fired for expressing it, he decides to put his new philosophy to the test as an independent agent with the only athlete who stays with him and his former colleague.","By definition, and depending upon who you're talking to, `Success' can be measured in a number of different ways.  It's winning the competition, celebrating a Golden Wedding Anniversary or, to many, just making the most money.  The first two are absolutes; you win and you make it to number 50. No gray areas.  If you're not dead, you're alive; you're either pregnant or you're not.  But in regards to that third item on the list, what are the parameters by which you measure that particular success?  Are there lines across which you will not step to make that extra buck?  Or do you do whatever it takes-- including selling your soul and sacrificing your very identity-- to make as much of the green as you can.  Is that success?  Or is that selling out.  Can there, in fact, be true success when ethics and integrity are absent?  It's the territory writer/director Cameron Crowe explores in `Jerry Maguire,' the hit 1996 film that landed him an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, a Best Actor nomination for star Tom Cruise, and captured the award for Best Supporting Actor for Cuba Gooding Jr.Jerry Maguire (Cruise) is a high-powered sports agent for a huge agency, handling a portfolio filled with high profile sports figures.  And the name of Jerry's game is money; he gets the big bucks for those he represents, he keeps them in the limelight and in the end pulls down some mighty big bucks for himself and the firm.  But at what price?  Who is Jerry Maguire, really? Has he played the chameleon for so long as a means to an end that even he doesn't know who he is anymore?  Does he even consider it?  If he stopped to think about it, the answer would be a resounding `No.'  But then something happens.  One night, he wakes up and happens to look at himself in the mirror, and for whatever reason, it suddenly dawns on him what a selfish, soulless, empty life he is leading.  So in the wake of this epiphany, he seizes the moment, sits down at his keyboard and hammers out a `mission/morality statement,' in which he reorganizes his entire approach to his career, including reestablishing parameters and setting new priorities making conscience, ethics and integrity his paramount concerns.  And while still riding the high of his nocturnal enlightenment, he goes to his office, makes copies of his statement and distributes it to the mailboxes of everyone from his boss on down.  Then he goes home and goes to bed.In the cold light of morning, however, he realizes what he's done and races to his office to avert disaster.  Too late.  He enters the room to a hail of praise and appreciation from his peers, but his boss is less enthusiastic. It's no surprise to Jerry, then, when the big `M' his superiors are interested in turns out to be `Money' and not `Morality,' as in `Money talks, Jerry walks.'  And just like that he's out the door.  But before he leaves, he vows to make it on his own.  He's up, he's positive, he has his statement-- and he doesn't have a clue what to do next.  What he does know is that the adventure of a lifetime is awaiting.  And the world is about to meet the `real' Jerry Maguire.Cameron Crowe made his debut as a writer/director with `Say Anything' in 1989, in which he first exhibited that keen insight into the human condition that has been one of the trademarks of his success as a filmmaker.  In `Jerry Maguire' he demonstrates again that acute sense of knowing what makes people tick, and leaves no doubt that he knows how to convey it to his audience.  Crowe's story, as well as the presentation, is original and imaginative, and he fills it with real characters involved in very real situations.  And it's the characters that really sell it, because these are three-dimensional people, not just cardboard cut-outs, and moreover, Cameron knows how to get the best out of his actors to really bring them to life.Tom Cruise was the perfect choice to play Jerry; he has the look, the energy and the talent to get inside this guy's skin and make him tick, and he successfully channels his natural exuberance into his character, tempering his performance just enough to make it really work.  An Oscar nomination does not come cheaply, and Cruise certainly deserved the one he received for his work here.Cuba Gooding Jr.'s performance is deserving of the acclaim he received for it, as well.  As Rod Tidwell, the pro football player/client who sticks by Jerry and insists that he `Show me the money!' Gooding equals, if not surpasses Cruise's level of enthusiasm with a vibrant and rich portrayal that makes Rod one of his most memorable characters.  Like Cruise, Gooding is perfectly cast and points up, again, what an acute sense Cameron has for who and what will work to bring his story so convincingly to the screen.Not to be outdone by her co-stars, Renee Zellweger gives an endearing performance as the vulnerable but steadfast, single mom, Dorothy Boyd. She's such a `giving' actor, and she endows Dorothy with a gentle, caring manner that expresses her deepest thoughts and feelings so well.  Her reaction, in the scene in which Jerry tells Dorothy-- with his back turned to her-- that he has broken up with his fiancee, Avery (Kelly Preston), is priceless, and alone makes this film worth watching (repeatedly).  Her work here is every bit as Oscar worthy as Cruise and Gooding's, and it's hard to understand why she was overlooked, as she is such a vital presence in this film.  9/10.The supporting cast includes Jerry O'Connell (Frank), Jay Mohr (Bob Sugar), Bonnie Hunt (terrific in her role of Laurel Boyd, Dorothy's sister), Regina King (Marcee) and Jonathan Lipnicki, unforgettable as Dorothy's precocious son, Ray.  A triumph for Cameron Crowe, this movie is, indeed, magic."
The Count of Monte Cristo,2002,7.7,"A young man, falsely imprisoned by his jealous ""friend"", escapes and uses a hidden treasure to exact his revenge.","I really didn't appreciate this film until the second viewing. Afterwards, I thought, ""Wow, that was really a satisfying, great film to watch."" Satisfying, of course, to see the typical good guy-gets-revenge tale but also a film which provided some beautiful scenery and photography all the way through: a real treat for the eyes and must-see on a widescreen DVD.I also put on the English subtitles on the second viewing in parts, which helped me understand a few things I missed on the first viewing and had made the film just a bit confusing in several parts. That was cleared up, and the rest was just enjoying the scenery and performances.Most fun to watch was Richard Harris as ""Priest,"" the longtime prisoner who tutors young Jim Caviezel, the man (Edmond Dantes) unjustly imprisoned who exacts his revenge in the last hour of the movie. Yes, Harris' teaching stretched credibility as he seems to teach his pupil about everything there is know in life! Harris, too, had some of the best lines in the movie, several very profound statements. Ironic that he would be giving Caviezel - who two years later was playing Jesus in ""The Passion Of The Christ"" - sermons about believing in God! That's Hollywood! One film you're an atheist, the next you are God.For those who might think the first 30-40 minutes of this movie are a bit slow, stay with it as the action picks up once Caviezel escapes from the prison. Shortly afterward, he is aided by the other character I found most fun to watch, played by Luis Gusman, who still sounds like he's more at home in the streets of New York but, once again, you suspend belief and just go along for the ride.Strange how our human nature makes revenge so sweet when forgiveness is the right thing to do, but Hollywood has always capitalized on this human failing, making enjoyable films like this. To be fair, it isn't just revenge, as this film points out, it's ""justice"" we all like to see. In here, the two words are interchanged, depending upon ones rationalizations."
The Mummy Returns,2001,6.4,"The mummified body of Imhotep is shipped to a museum in London, where he once again wakes and begins his campaign of rage and terror.","If you've seen the trailer for this movie, you're probably expecting fast paced adventure, non-stop action and a special effects extravaganza with just enough story to keep it all interesting.  And if that's what you're hoping for, you certainly won't be disappointed; because that's exactly what you get in `The Mummy Returns,' written and directed by Stephen Sommers. The story begins in Egypt, where Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and his wife, Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) discover an ancient bracelet that had once belonged to a warrior known as `The Scorpion King (The Rock),' who, back in the day, had sold his soul to the god, Anubis, for control of his armies and domination of the world.  Now, it seems, The Scorpion King's resurrection is imminent, and if he succeeds and once again raises the armies of Anubis, he could very well take over or destroy the world.  Followers of Im-Ho-Tep (Arnold Vosloo), however, who are privy to this information as well, decide to resurrect their dark leader so that he can face The Scorpion King, defeat him, take control of Anubis' armies and conquer the world himself, putting them in control.  But the key to the whole plan lies with who has control of the bracelet at the time of The Scorpion King's resurrection.  And the O'Connells have taken it back home with them to London.So the adventure begins in earnest, moving from Egypt to London, then back again to Egypt.  Along the way, there's plenty of mummies, fighting, and bugs, but very few surprises, except for one scene near the end when something quite unexpected happens.  The story itself gets somewhat lost in the muddle, but it doesn't really matter; plot is fairly insignificant in a movie like this, as long as it maintains at least a thread of credibility and can give the action some context.  And that it does, so all is well and it allows you to get on with what this movie is really all about, which-- simply put-- is having a good time.With shades of `Indiana Jones' and `Star Wars' abounding, the real success of this movie lies in the fact that it never pretends to be anything other than what it is or what it was meant to be, and that is an entertaining, fun movie.  It's visually explosive, from the sweeping, desert vistas of the converging, battling armies, to the mummies and assorted demons and creatures generously sprinkled throughout.  And the hand-to-hand combat scenes between Evelyn and Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velazquez) are especially thrilling.  The one element of the film that doesn't seem to work too well has to do with a particular mode of transportation to which the O'Connells must resort upon their return to Egypt, and which ultimately plays a significant part in the outcome of the whole adventure.  It's something that seemingly would have been more appropriate in `The Adventures of Baron Munchausen' or `Peter Pan.'As far as the performances, suffice to say that the actors involved all do their jobs well; after all, in a movie like this you're not going to find anyone struggling with `The Method.'  Fraser strikes a handsome, heroic pose-- call him a poor man's Indiana Jones-- and Weisz is becoming as Evelyn.  Most importantly, they all walk the walk and talk the talk, and Sommers keeps them on track and wisely avoids allowing any lapses into `camp' or tongue-in-cheek character interpretations, which makes this a solid, fun-filled, action-adventure movie that is what it is.The supporting cast includes John Hannah (providing some comic relief as Jonathan Carnahan), Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Lock Nah), Freddie Boath (Alex O'Connell) and Obed Fehr (Ardeth Bay).  As with most sequels, you'll get more out of `The Mummy Returns' if you've seen the original, which had more of a story and, of course, would give you the background of the characters. But even on it's own and taken at face value, this movie is a feast for the senses, and just a lot of good fun.  Just don't go in expecting anything more than what the trailer promises; if you can do that, chances are you're going to enjoy the movie and have a good time.  I rate this one 7/10."
RoboCop,1987,7.6,"In a violent future in Old Detroit, murdered police officer Alex Murphy is resurrected as RoboCop, a powerful cyborg law enforcer. As he fights crime, he begins to recover memories of his past and seeks revenge on the gang who killed him.","My favorite Paul Verhoeven feature by a mile. It's a decent film if you like action but everything around it makes Robocop a different film in the genre. It's a movie that's blatant and upfront about its story but depending on who you are you can interpret it in different ways. It could be about public funding, gentrification, humanism, or just a dude who goes around shooting drug dealers. But what I really like about it is even though it's a movie that might seem fascistic on the surface it surprisingly doesn't punch down, at least not like films of the era that were just military propaganda. I know not everything I'm mentioning is an intentional decision on the writer's part, and to be honest I never thought the action was that great (except during the end), but my main point is this movie deserves more thought IF you're a fan of the genre."
X-Men: First Class,2011,7.7,"In the 1960s, superpowered humans Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr work together to find others like them, but Erik's vengeful pursuit of an ambitious mutant who ruined his life causes a schism to divide them.","Reviewers say 'X-Men: First Class' is lauded for its strong performances by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, and for revitalizing the franchise. Themes include the origin stories of Professor X and Magneto, mutant identity, and historical events. Criticisms involve deviations from comic storylines, inconsistent character ages, and script weaknesses. Despite these, many appreciate the action sequences, visual effects, and future series potential."
Universal Soldier: Regeneration,2009,5.3,"When terrorists threaten nuclear catastrophe at Chernobyl, the world's only hope is to reactivate decommissioned Universal Soldier Luc Deveraux.","I have a confession to make ‚Äì I have never seen a Universal Soldier film, not in its entirety anyway, nor even the original way back in 1992 when it starred Jean Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren as these programmed super soldiers who are impervious to pain, and a small troupe can take out battalions of a conventional army. For those like me who are not well versed in the mythos, fret not as this film's subtitle ‚Äì a new beginning ‚Äì made it a point to do a quick recap of the secret super soldier programme to bring us all up to speed to where the film now takes place.There were some in the audience who found it rather startling that the film opened in abrupt manner, chiefly because this is meant for the straight to video market overseas. So the distributor's logo doesn't kick in to pre-empt you that this is not a trailer, but the start of the film proper. And boy does it start with a bang, with an ambitious, noisy car chase cum massacre where a small group of freedom fighters kidnap the children of the Russian Prime Minister, and demands the release of their countrymen in lockup, in which failure meant the killing of the kidnapped children, plus the detonation of another reactor in Chernobyl where they are dug in, which has enough radioactive material to cause another fallout.This of course mobilizes a NATO-Russian alliance of sorts to fight back with 2 mission objectives under 72 hours, with the only snag in the mission being the use of an NGU (Next Generation Uni-Sol) by the opposition, played to mean perfection by Andrei Arlovski as the ultimate killing machine who feels no pain and dishes out his fair share of punishment to maim and kill without remorse. The response of course is for the coalition to send in their own Uni-Sols, which are painfully outdated and obsolete when faced with the NGJ, so all hopes rest on one man, Jean Claude Van Damme, erm, his Luc Deveraux that is.Director John Hyams keeps it tight and relevant here by creating a film that doesn't try too much fanciful stuff. It's good ol' military and B-action all the way, which at times resembled a violent video game especially in JCVD's first mission outing when unleashed into enemy territory, adopting a third person, behind the character view as he charges and cuts through enemy ranks. Then there's some nifty camera-work as well, the highlight being a continuous take where it's a Counter-strike game-type with JCVD going from primary rifle, to secondary firearm, to default knife, and the fists as he rips through scores of faceless soldiers. I thought that was one of the best action sequences in the film, since the much touted plummeting with Dolph Lundgren, who also returned for this film, was nothing not already seen before, save for the expectation of a rematch here.For action junkies, there is a bit of a nostalgia in seeing how our old school action heroes still have it in them to carry a movie and give the new wannabes a run for their money. Visibly aged, this film follows the trend of late with our 80s action icons coming out and banding together for one last hurrah. While this may be for the video market in the US, it certainly didn't scrimp on its limited production values to turn in something professional looking, with some impressive gory action compensating for a standard, average plot with room to grow the franchise further. Now bring on The Expendables, and boy, will we action fans just rejoice with that reunion!"
Premium Rush,2012,6.5,"In Manhattan, a bike messenger picks up an envelope that attracts the interest of a dirty cop, who pursues the cyclist throughout the city.","Premium Rush is a commercial film that sticks to being a 'B' movie with some A-movie assets - chiefly the actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Michael Shannon as the hero and opposition - and David Koepp does a very good job balancing those elements. It could have been just a straight to video title, but it's smart about being a little movie (that is, not quite as on the radar as a big summer tentpole), and has a script that can hold its story and juggle a few elements with more than just competency, that you can go for the ride without being insulted. And yes, it isn't just hyperbole saying it's a 'ride'; here, as in some TV shows (only here with better visual intentions than just quick- adrenaline-fixes), we see with big visual effects the scenarios our hero Wiley (yes, perhaps ironically named as he is really the Roadrunner) navigates the streets, his main route, and then when he's at a cross- walk and cars coming on all sides which of three paths he could take and if he'll die or not or kill others.Sure, most of us (those of us walking or driving in a city, such as New York) don't like bike messengers, but it's in abstract or in the all-too personal. Koepp's cleverness is to look at a bike messenger on the street and go 'hmm, how about a movie about him and what he has to do, and then what if we throw in a crooked cop and a mob element and a woman wanting to reunite with her kid?' A lot of these elements on their own (and perhaps still the woman with the kid) could be under-cooked or just not very interesting. Altogether, they amount to something, rather that the elements can connect through Michael Shannon's cop Detective Monday (or ""Officer Ackerman"") who sets a lot of this into motion through his comically inept gambling addiction and inability to get money together - or a ticket from a bike messenger.Some of this may just seem like 'screenwriting 101', with pieces like the woman with the son and the hero's conflicts (love interest, side- opponent in another bike messenger, the latter I didn't care for as it was too weak on its own and in the movie), but hey, in a first-level class there can be good work done! It's not even a 'turn off your brain' kind of suspense thriller either; Koepp has enough experience to inject, along with his co-writer, really funny or witty dialog, solid (albeit 'movie') character dynamics as people ride on their bikes and can speak on their blue-tooth phones. It's so good when watching the actors bicycling along, and some stunt doubles but who knows when they really use them it's so well integrated, it almost slows the movie down when they have to stop to fill in the spots of the story's quasi- MacGuffin object in the envelope.But mostly, it's the acting that carries it through. Gordon-Levitt is an appealing lead, likable but has a tough attitude when he needs to, and of course you got to go with him. But without Shannon, frankly, I don't know if the movie would have been as successful, at least to the level it's at now. He's such a convincingly kooky-looking villain, brutal, nasty, but cartoonish in a big way (listen to his laugh, or chuckle, and it's a touch of Chucky the doll or something!) Even in a supposedly marginal Hollywood thrill-ride, Shannon brings his A-game."
30 Minutes or Less,2011,6.0,"Two fledgling criminals kidnap a pizza delivery guy, strap a bomb to his chest, and inform him that he has mere hours to rob a bank or else...","Though the screenwriter Michael Diliberti denies it, it's pretty clear with the striking similarities that 30 Minutes or Less is trying to mirror the 2003 incident where a pizza delivery man was forced to rob a bank with, what he thought, was a fake bomb around his neck. Unfortunately it wasn't, and the bomb exploded killing him. Diliberti was said to be ""vaguely aware"" of it, but after you watch the film, then read the story, it becomes pretty clear that he was more than that.30 Minutes or Less is a highly energetic comedy with many laughs, but way too many action set pieces. It relies on that instead of the chemistry between Jesse Eisenberg and Aziz Ansari. The film is about Nick (Eisenberg), a pizza man who promises your pizza in thirty minutes or less. His best friend Chet (Ansari) is disgusted when he learns that Nick is sleeping with his twin sister Kate (Vadsaria). They fight and then go on with their merry way.Meanwhile we are also introduced to Dwayne (McBride) and Travis (Swardson), two losers who work for ten dollars an hour cleaning Dwayne's father's pool. Dwayne's dad (played by Fred Ward who scores some of the biggest and dirtiest laughs in the film) was in the military and won the ten million dollar jackpot on the lottery years ago. He spends his money worse than a drunken sailor on big screen TVs, pools, and cars, but somehow has managed to not blow all ten million yet. This causes much dismay amongst Dwayne who is sick of his father's spending habits and his unpleasant personality.One night at a strip club, a dancer convinces Dwayne that she should call her hit-man (Pena) to kill Dwayne's father so he can inherit the money so that she can make quite a few bucks off of him. The problem is that the hit-man needs $100,000 or he won't do it. So, Dwayne and Travis call an unsuspecting pizza man, who of course has to be Nick, strap a bomb vest to him, tell him that he needs to rob a bank in less than ten hours or the bomb will detonate. When he gets the money he'll be given a code that will disarm the bomb.That is one bloated comedic premise, and it astonishes me everyone in the film is stupid enough to actually go through with all that. Director Ruben Fleischer who worked with Eisenberg on Zombieland two years ago has unfortunately made him take about ten steps back from the genius he played in The Social Network.Eisenberg and Ansari seem like they could assist in making some lovable, Harold and Kumar-like chemistry. The problem is the film doesn't ever want to let the characters go off on their own, and at the fear of the audience becoming bored, they decide to throw in so many clich√© action set pieces. Once the heist happens, the film doesn't have any purpose else so it decides to throw in a bunch of typical twists and turns hoping to extend the plot past an hour and twenty minutes. It already barely sustains a full length film.30 Minutes or Less does pack in some pretty heavy laughs, most of them coming from Aziz Ansari as he shows why he should be involved as the lead in more R-rated comedies. He's different and funnier than most comedy actors and he almost compliments the mediocre Danny McBride and Nick Swardson. All I can say is that 2011, along with Your Highness, has not been a kind year for Danny McBride. And when considering Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star it hasn't necessarily been Swardson's year-to-remember either.The premise is cute, the actors are energetic and lively, and some big laughs are achieved. Ultimately, this is the work of a first time screenwriter and instead of working on something much, much easier, he decided to dive into a film with sizable stars with basic skills. I wouldn't mind seeing Jesse Eisenberg and Aziz Ansari in a film together again, in fact, I'd commend it, but hopefully next time they'll be in a film where there is more laughs and less yelling.Starring: Jesse Eisenberg, Aziz Ansari, Danny McBride, Nick Swardson, Fred Ward, and Michael Pena. Directed by: Reuben Fleischer."
Skyfall,2012,7.8,"James Bond's loyalty to M is tested when her past comes back to haunt her. When MI6 comes under attack, 007 must track down and destroy the threat, no matter how personal the cost.","Bond 23 and 007 has to literally come back from the dead when a stolen hard-drive makes M (Dench) look bad at a time when a face from her past comes homing into blood thirsty view.There is one sure fire fact in cinema that nobody can dispute, that of there never ever being a James Bond film that all Bondphiles will agree on. From each corner of the spectrum will come arguments that said Bond film is not gritty enough, not fun enough, not enough sex, not enough action, not enough fantastical stunts and etc etc etc. Well that's fine of course, we all have our peccadilloes we prefer in our Bond movies, but we do live in different times now, the world has changed, and so has Bond. You may not get the ultimate Bond you want, but this is a 21st Century Bond and a new era of 007 is upon us, something which makes Skyfall even the more bolder and braver because it marks the 50th anniversary by blending the old with the new and mostly achieving brilliant results.Skyfall allows us to bathe in nostalgia whilst also forcing us to re- evaluate just where we are at in terms of our beloved super secret agent. One of the great things about this Bond is that there is a bubbling under current of time's importance delicately perched on each side of James Bond's shoulders. Is he (and M etc) outdated? Or is the future still in need of such operatives/organisations? Director Mendes and his team don't take any of the easy options that were clearly available to them to answer the question, they instead build a film around Bond and M as characters, embrace the traditions of the series and hit us hard in head and heart.The plot of Skyfall as written is simple, absolutely nailed on it is straight and true to Hollywood conventions, but what fills out the simple plot is a series of Bondian delights, thrills spills and emotionally splintered kills. The stunning pre-credits sequence sees Bond traverse the rooftops of Istanbul on a motorcycle and then fight on top of a speeding train. Only to then find himself expendable. Which leads to Daniel Kleinman's title credits sequence that is filled with ominous portents of death and blood, in turn backed by the wonderfully Bondian of old title song warbled by Adele. It's clear at this point that this Bond movie is nodding to traditional values whilst promising to deliver some emotional pain. And so it proves.A washed up Bond enters the fray, and he convinces, he's dishevelled, unshaven and unfit, but he's still a tough bastard who can drink hard and stare a scorpion down. He'll be back soon, we know this, and he will be in wonderful physical shape, and loyal to his surrogate mother for sure. Ah, but there's the adversary on the scene now, a villain to finally give Craig's Bond something to fret about. It's Javier Bardem's (perfect) Silva, a cyber terrorist with a shock of blonde hair, a nasty dental trick and a devilish sexiness that unnerves during an interrogation scene; to which Bond cheekily opens up some wink wink possibilities. There is other sexual tension in the film as well, not just a steamy shower scene, but the ongoing banter with Naomie Harris' (excellent) Eve that positively fizzes with smirking innuendo.But ultimately this comes down to the love between a man and a woman, the kind that is so different to the type that has so often underpinned a Bond movie. Bond will kill or be killed for M, and how marvellous to see a director really able to give Judi Dench the direction she so deserves, and Bond, in Craig's magnetic and gritty hands, responds in kind to deliver a last half hour as good as any in the 50 years of Bond on film. As we know, all turf is Bond's turf, but this time it really is HIS turf, and as a little back story comes seeping out, Bond gets to exorcise some demons whilst kicking considerable ass. Get ready Bondphiles, this has the emotional wallop only seen in the best Bond movies of old.All the Bondian trappings are still here, exotic locales, gorgeous women, speeding vehicles, fights, stupendous stunts, bizarre lairs and balls out machismo. It's also funny! I myself commented when reviewing Quantum of Solace that it was pretty ace as an action film, but for many it's not Bondian enough, and the truth of the matter is Bond still needs to have a degree of fun, no matter how grim and gritty the story line is. Thankfully Skyfall is often a blast, with Craig (surely convincing even the most stubborn of dissenters how good a Bond he is) having the confidence and skill to lace his Bond's macho broody instinct with a desert dry wit and shrug of the shoulders nonchalance. Other side of the camera the tech credits are high, with Deakins proving to be one of the aces in the pack. His capturing of vistas, be it a neon city scape or a mountainous valley, are eye delights, his colour tones are beautiful, I promise you, nobody these days does golden browns like Deakins.It's not the masterpiece that I or gazillions of others hoped for, and it does have flaws (new Q a bit too geeky safe, finale lacks a substantial battle with the villain) and it remains simple in plot, but it's Bond's birthday and the birthday boy has been done proud by the makers. It's a new era Bond for sure, but that most definitely isn't a bad thing, it knows its past and it now knows its future, and without doubt we all still know the name. 9/10"
The Dictator,2012,6.5,The heroic story of a dictator who risked his life to ensure that democracy would never come to the country he so lovingly oppressed.,"I went to see this movie with my friend. I would consider that we both have a good sense of humor and are open to all sorts of jokes. I have seen other movies by Sacha Baron Cohen, like Bruno and Borat. I found Borat to be hilarious, but Bruno was a bit over the top for me. This movie strikes a balance between the two, but leans more towards (my personally favored) Borat side.The comedy in this movie is both hilarious and uncomfortable at times. It has the same LOL- quality as it did in Borat, but there are scenes where the comedy is so crude that it is almost uncomfortable watching/listening to it. The movie is definitely funny, but you will not enjoy it if you do not find jokes about racism and stereotypes funny.The plot is your typical Sacha Baron Cohen plot; a person from an entirely different culture travels to America and you watch how incompatible the two cultures are. Also, just like most of Sacha Baron Cohen movies, there is a love story intertwined. It's not the dramatic and sensitive kind of love story though. The plot itself is not very immersive, and I believe that its only purpose is to lead you to the funny parts.I will say this though, the ending speech of this movie given by 'The Dictator' really impressed me. It made me realize how well Sacha Baron Cohen understands politics and stereotypes. You have to hear it for yourself.If you're looking for a movie with consistent but crude laugh-out-loud comedy, but do not look for a serious and powerful plot, then you will enjoy this film. On the other hand, if you cringe at racist and stereotype jokes, you will be covering your ears virtually the entire movie.Approach with an open mind."
The Grey,2011,6.7,"After their plane crashes in Alaska, six oil workers are led by a skilled huntsman to survival, but a pack of merciless wolves haunts their every step.","An airplane loaded with roughneck oilmen crashes in Alaska and the survivors trek through a snow storm to survive while a pack of wolves kill them off one by one.Some reviewers loved it. Some hated it. Those who loved it saw a competently directed action horror film in a realistic setting filled with real people facing real threats. Those who hated it saw an unrealistic depiction of wildlife behavior and unworkable outdoor skills. People who loved it thought the movie was realistic. People who hated it thought it was ridiculous.Without giving away the story, let me tell you that this is not a story about actual wolf behavior. This is more like the numerous movies of the produced through the '70s, '80s and '90s about a group of people picked off one by one by unseen creatures lurking in the dark. In the '70s, they were natural animals like sharks, killer whales, reptiles, furry animals and insects. In the '80s they were space aliens and robots. In the '90s they were super assassins. Lately they are vampires and zombies. Now we are back to furry animals. But the overall theme is the same.It is refreshing to see this theme played out in the Alaskan wilderness rather than on a space ship or an underground city overrun by zombies. In that sense, this movie is realistic. But the furry animals in the movie behave more like space aliens than actual wolves. The ""expert hunter"" in the movie is not actually giving you wisdom that will be useful in the Alaskan wilderness. He is more of a generic zombie hunter. In that sense, this movie is unrealistic.So whether you like this movie or not depends entirely on what you are in the mood to see. If you want Discovery Channel, look elsewhere. If you want to see good acting in a scenic backdrop with lots of scary moments, you will like this movie. You don't have to really check in your brain at the door. Like so many Ridley Scott movies, this one is also a meditation on the nature of fate. This movie is a good piece of fiction. Just a bad documentary."
The Hurt Locker,2008,7.5,"During the Iraq War, a Sergeant recently assigned to an army bomb squad is put at odds with his squad mates due to his maverick way of handling his work.","For some of my friends this was just a solid action movie, nothing else. I watched it yesterday and for me it was much more than just action, this movie was a deeply affecting series of shots that make truly feel the war in Iraq and make you see the sacrifice that's going on out there.There are a few things that everyone must notice while watching the movie. There is some superb acting present throughout the whole movie, especially by Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie and I wouldn't be surprised to see one or more Oscar nominations for acting. There are also some pretty extreme editing achievements, that even I, an amateur movie-lover, could see. Cinematography and some other technical achievements are stunning as well. As far as technical part of the film goes, this movie is more than successful, it is to be expected that there will be some technical Oscar nominations as well. Writing is simple but that's the way it is and all my congratulations go to Mark Boal and Kathryn Bigelow for creating such a powerful war-drama that sticks with you even long after watching this film.I honestly hope that the Academy members won't forget abut this phenomenal movie achievement. I recommend everyone to watch this ""tool"" that allows us to see what the word WAR really means.Best regards from Slovenia"
No,2012,7.4,An advertising executive comes up with a campaign to defeat Augusto Pinochet in Chile's 1988 referendum.,"¬®Adios, Mr. Pinochet¬®No is one of those films which I wasn't looking forward to seeing because I just wasn't interested in the subject matter. I'm not into historical political movies, but this film was much more than that. No works more as a media satire than an actual political movie. The satire works really well and it reminds us of how important the media can be in our society. No should be required viewing for all advertising students in schools around the globe. The film works in great part thanks to Gael Garcia Bernal's performance as the ad executive who comes up with the campaign for No in the referendum. Bernal has proved in the past that he's a very reliable actor, and one of the best in Latin America. The film also has great direction from Pablo Larra√≠n, who decided to shoot the film using U-matic video tape to give it a more 80's vibe since that was the type of video which was used then. That brought a sense of realism to the movie, and at times it felt like a documentary. This was a well crafted film, and a decent contender for best foreign film of the year. It lost to Amour in the Oscars, but received a lot of love in the Cannes Festival last year. The screenplay was very well adapted by Pedro Peirano (who also wrote the screenplay for 2009's The Maid, a well received Chilean film) from Antonio Skarmeta's (famous for his novel Il Postino) play. This is one art house film you won't regret watching.It's the end of the 80's and Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinochet, has called for a national referendum after being pressured by international organisms. After 15 years of dictatorship, Pinochet is allowing the country to vote Yes or No to him extending his rule for 8 more years in the country. Everyone is convinced that this is all a farce and just a means for Pinochet to legalize his authority. Pinochet is also convinced he will win the elections considering that he has brought economic stability to the country. For 27 days both parties will be allowed to have a 15 minute spot of uninterrupted television air time in which they can campaign. This is where the young ad executive known as Rene Saavedra (Gael Garcia Bernal) comes to play. The No coalition decides to hire him to lead their campaign, but what they don't realize is that he will bring a unique approach to the campaign. Since Pinochet's dictatorship was known for its brutal intimidation and censorship, everyone in the No coalition expects to make their voice heard and focus on the violence and brutality of his government, but Saavedra has a different view: He wants to make a joyful, colorful, and upbeat campaign where the primary message is that ¬®Chile: happiness is coming.¬® Everyone in the campaign is upset about this, including Saavedra's ex wife, Veronika (Antonia Zegers), who thinks all this is just a waste of time. However, the campaign begins resonating with voters, and Pinochet's people decide to hire Saavedra's boss, Lucho Guzman (Alfredo Castro), to counteract the comedic and joyful campaign. Things won't be easy for the No coalition because the government begins intimidating and pressuring them through violence, but Saavedra knows that his campaign can change the course of the country for the better.Advertising is a powerful weapon in today's world, and more than ever we see governments trying to control and censor the media. The reason being that they know that it can shift elections and bring down tyrannical leaders. That is why more than ever, we must fight to keep governments from trying to control or censor the media. What a lot of politics have done is use advertising wisely to get elected. The film is a great case study on politics and media and how they are correlated. No is a film everyone involved in media and politics should see because it shows the advantages and disadvantages that this medium has. Pablo Larrain has directed a powerful film which teaches us how the media can influence public opinion so easily. If only we could have more uplifting and joyful political campaigns like this I would be much more interested in voting. I vote yes: go see this movie.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
Coupling,,8.5,Six best friends talk about all aspects of sex and relationships on their never-ending quest to find true love.,"Reviewers say 'Coupling' is a British sitcom exploring six friends' relationships and sex with mature, risqu√© humor. Often likened to 'Friends' and 'Seinfeld', it stands out with witty, creative writing by Steven Moffat. Key themes include relationship complexities and gender differences. Characters are unique, contributing to the charm, though some criticize repetitive themes and lack of development. Celebrated for sharp writing, memorable lines, and cast chemistry, it excels in adult themes and humor."
Slumdog Millionaire,2008,8.0,"When a teenager from the slums of Mumbai is interrogated about his suspicious performance on a quiz show, he revisits various events from his past to explain how he knew all the answers.","There has already been some talk coming from Telluride that this film is set to be this year's 'Juno.' It does have the same distributor and it is set for the same release period, and for anyone who hears this buzz, they will definitely not be disappointed.During the premiere of the final cut (in the words of director Danny Boyle) at the Toronto International Film Festival, the audience gave the film an incredibly enthusiastic response, and it went on to win the People's Choice Award. Boyle, who is somewhat like a British Richard Linklater for yet again surprising the audience with such diverse subject matter, worked his magic. He transcended genres and created a truly unique and energetic picture.Just about every aspect of this film deserves merit, and above all it belongs to Boyle, who managed to assemble such a massive achievement. The score by A. R. Rahman, with contributions from M. I. A., perfectly accompanies the action on screen. Still, it is great enough to be listened to on its own. With India as a backdrop, Boyle and his cinematographer have composed some remarkable images. The acting is roundly impressive, especially coming from the younger cast, almost all of which has never acted before.The film begins as Jamal (Skins' Dev Patel) is under interrogation by Mumbai police for cheating on India's version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire, being only one question away from winning it all. As the inspector says, even doctors and lawyers cannot come close to the 20m rupee prize, and so Jamal, having grown up on the streets of Mumbai, cannot possibly know these things. As Jamal tries to avoid further torture, he begins to explain to the police how he knew each of the answers. Flashbacks present Jamal's boyhood and explain how he got to the show.At the centre of his journey is his brother, Salim, and a girl, Latika, who is left a homeless orphan after an attack that took Jamal's mother as well. After running from a man who exploits the trio for labour, Jamal replays the incident when Latika left his life when she was unable to catch a moving train. His uncertainty of her fate on the streets of Mumbai and his intense desire to see his first and only love again lead him to the interrogation room where the film began.Like 'Juno,' Slumdog Millionaire is by genre a comedic drama, but it becomes much more. The film asks questions about fate, righteousness, greed, and even urban sprawl. Above all, however, it asks about love in the face of the most dire obstacles, and if it can truly prosper. Jamal's story is a tragic and unfortunate one, but as seen through his eyes, it is still beautiful. The vast colour palate of India overwhelm any negative feelings, and Jamal's hope of finding and being with Latika overwhelm despair. For Jamal, 20m rupees isn't his prize. It would be nearly impossible for there to be a better picture this year."
Battleship,2012,5.8,A fleet of ships is forced to do battle with an armada of unknown origins in order to discover and thwart their destructive goals.,"Heaven help me! I liked this movie, now I am going to be one of the few who did. As you can see from the other reviews a lot of people didn't like this movie, so why did I?1. I came in with low expectations - I was expecting something horrible, boring, long and pointless, but despite myself I liked it, I laughed at the jokes, I connected with the actors (yes, Rihanna too), I was excited by the action and while clich√©s the plot held my interest2. The actors did a good job with what they were given - Taylor Kitsch did a good job, Rihanna wasn't that bad, I dare say good, in her role. She was there, she didn't try to chew the scenery, she did her job as an actor/secondary character and it didn't bother me. I give her kudos3. lost in translation? - you try to make a game into a movie and you want to put parts of them game in it? Not easy, a little cheesy? Of course, but fun? Yes, fun, enjoyable, and in the end it was a part of the story that wasn't as forced as it could have been.So in conclusion, ""Battleship"" is a fun, corny, typical summer movie that I like but as you see a lot of people didn't. I think it is a guilty pleasure, something to be enjoyed by the few but annoyed by the rest. In the end I can only suggest this - go in with low expectations, expect a little over the top patriotism like in ""Act of Valor"" ( but not so heavy), and don't think about it. The movie is not without its flaws or questionable logic, but as it was said so well in another movie - ""I suggest you don't think about it and just enjoy the ride"""
Crash,2004,7.7,Racial tensions collide in a collection of intertwined stories involving residents of Los Angeles.,"In a drama strikingly reminiscent in style and tone of P.T. Anderson's film Magnolia (1999), the narrative in Crash shifts between 5 or 6 different groups of seemingly unconnected characters, whose relationships to each other are only revealed in the end.Not to be confused with the David Cronenberg feature of the same name, this Crash is the feature-length, studio-released directorial debut of veteran Canadian TV writer/producer/director and two-time Emmy-winner Paul Haggis. An in-depth exploration on the themes of racism and prejudice, cause and effect, chance and coincidence, and tragedy, ""crash"" is a metaphor for the collisions between strangers in the course of day-to-day existence. Set over a 24-hour period in contemporary L.A., it is a social commentary on the interconnectedness of life in the big city.Crash features a top-notch ensemble cast which includes: Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Jennifer Esposito, Brendan Fraser, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Loretta Devine, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillipe and Larenz Tate. All put in superb performances in a tight script which is at once gritty, heartwarming, shocking, tragic and witty, and which will ring true with viewers of all demographics.Centering around two disturbing car accidents, a carjacking, vicious workplace vandalism, and the suspicious shooting death of one police officer by another, the drama is set against the backdrop of a racist LAPD and Los Angeles justice system. Action shifts between the various characters, whose lives collide with each other in unpredictable ways as each faces their own moral dilemma, and tries to cope with the consequences of their resulting decision made or action taken. Each of the dozen or so main characters undergoes some type of a personal metamorphosis as the various story lines head toward a striking, common conclusion, which succeeds at being both cathartic and unsettling.Crash is backed by a solid and varied, original soundtrack and excellent cinematography. Sweeping, wider shots alternate with disjointed camera angles which convey the chaos and confusion of the characters and the unpredictability of life. Occasional lingering close-ups -- on occasion without sound -- capture the actors' facial expressions, which suitably detail key moments of the characters' aching pain, fear, anger, bitter anguish, remorse or grief, far better than any dialogue could.This breathtaking film is destined to be a critical smash and box-office hit. Five stars."
A Beautiful Mind,2001,8.2,"A mathematical genius, John Nash made an astonishing discovery early in his career and stood on the brink of international acclaim. But the handsome and arrogant Nash soon found himself on a harrowing journey of self-discovery.","Reviewers say 'A Beautiful Mind' is a powerful film showcasing John Nash's genius and schizophrenia struggles. Russell Crowe's performance is acclaimed for its depth and authenticity. The film's sensitive portrayal of schizophrenia is praised, though some find it dramatized. Ron Howard's direction and the screenplay receive high marks, but pacing and historical accuracy are criticized. The depiction of Nash's relationships, especially with Alicia, adds emotional depth, though some find them idealized."
Shakespeare in Love,1998,7.1,"History's greatest playwright is young, out of ideas and short of cash, but meets his ideal woman and is inspired to write one of his most famous plays.","Those who are looking for a historically accurate portrayal of Shakespeare's life had better look elsewhere - but then this was never intended to be a serious look at the life of the man.  Those who attack it for its' fanciful relation to history have missed the point entirely.  It is a romantic comedy obsessed with nothing more than making references in storyline and plot to the plays of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, and those references are made so seamlessly it could almost be assumed that what we see on the screen actually happened to the man.In fact the overall story we are presented with is not new.  Anyone who had read or seen `Romeo and Juliet' will have a pretty shrewd idea of the path the narrative takes - the twist is that in the film, Shakespeare writes the play `Romeo and Juliet' in parallel to, and based on, his `real life' relationship with Lady Viola.The opening sees Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) desperately trying to write the masterpiece `Romeo and Ethel, the Pirates Daughter', a comedy he hopes will rival anything by Christopher Marlow (Rupert Everett).  Words fail him until his muse appears in the shape of Lady Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow), a noblewoman whose love for the work of Shakespeare's leads her to dress as a boy (since at the time women were not allowed on stage) and attend an audition in disguise (mistaken identity and women dressing as men are devices Shakespeare often used in his comedies).  She is given the role of Romeo and begins a forbidden relationship with Shakespeare, the only one who knows her real identity, in spite of the fact that she is betrothed to the villainous Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) at Queen Elizabeth's (Judi Dench) command.Fiennes portrays Shakespeare wonderfully and not as the infallible master of rhetoric.  He takes the Bard from the pedestal and brings him down to a human level that we can all sympathise with.  His relationship with Paltrow is handled sensitively, although many of the scenes that are exclusively their own did have enough a little too much `Chick-Flick' for my liking. Paltrow's R.P. accent is technically very good, and though I normally like my English to be played by the English, I was as happily surprised by her performance as I was by Ben Affleck's brief, but memorable portrayal of the self-important Ned Alleyn.  Much of the credit, though, must go to Michelle Guish for the wonderful supporting cast including:  Judi Dench, Simon Callow, Imelda Staunton, Jim Carter, Martin Clunes and Geoffrey Rush, to name but a few.John Madden directs hypnotically and constantly keeps the camera on the move but most credit for the film must go to Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard for their cunning and often self-parodying script.  The only comment I would make is regarding the sheer number of theatre references.  Those who have worked in the theatre will be aware of many, if not all, of the in-jokes that the film is littered with.  Those who have not may be left with the feeling that they have been excluded from much of the content."
The Departed,2006,8.5,An undercover cop and a mole in the police attempt to identify each other while infiltrating an Irish gang in South Boston.,"Reviewers say 'The Departed' is lauded for its gripping narrative, stellar performances, and Martin Scorsese's direction. Themes of moral ambiguity, intense undercover operations, and the crime-law enforcement dynamic are highlighted. Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Jack Nicholson receive acclaim. However, some critics find it lacks the depth and emotional resonance of 'Infernal Affairs', noting pacing issues, an uneven screenplay, and unnecessary additions. Despite these criticisms, 'The Departed' is widely regarded as a significant contribution to the crime thriller genre."
Gladiator,2000,8.5,A former Roman General sets out to exact vengeance against the corrupt emperor who murdered his family and sent him into slavery.,"Reviewers say 'Gladiator' is acclaimed for its epic scale, powerful performances, and emotional depth, especially Russell Crowe's Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus. The film's visual spectacle, Hans Zimmer's score, and Ridley Scott's direction receive high praise. However, criticisms point to the script's simplicity, historical inaccuracies, pacing issues, and over-reliance on CGI. Some find it emotionally cold and overly predictable. Despite these flaws, 'Gladiator' is celebrated for revitalizing the epic genre and its significant impact on audiences."
Chicago,2002,7.2,"Two death-row murderesses develop a fierce rivalry while competing for publicity, celebrity, and a sleazy lawyer's attention.","Fictional characters, as a whole, get away with more than is permissible in reality.  They do things we would never condone in our peers, yet still manage to elicit our sympathy.  Maybe it's a form of catharsis--instead of inflicting violence on other people, we watch someone onscreen do so and cheer them on.  Such is the case with ""Chicago""--the film features a large rogue's gallery of criminals, con men, and crooks, yet most of these are surprisingly likeable.  And yet, the urge to root for the bad guys is somewhat unsettling, for ""Chicago"" is a story about people beating the rap by manipulating the public, illiciting their sympathy and playing on their deep-seated need for the bizarre and bloody.Told one way, the story of ""Chicago"" sounds like a showbusiness drama: a young girl dreams of stardom.  She is initailly naive but learns quickly, rising into the blaze of limelight while an older, more experienced rival resents the new face that's stealing the show.  The twist is that the art is murder, and the stage is comprised of the papers, the radio, the courthouse, and the all-devouring public eye.  The veteran is Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a nightclub singer who did in her husband and sister after finding them in what is usually called ""a compromising position.""  The newcomer is Roxie Hart (Renee Zelweiger), a cutie-pie who shot her lover after finding out he was using her, and who expects her husband Amos (John C. Reilly, excellent as the quintessentail doormat) to stand by her afterwards.  Both women are represented by Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), who brags he can beat any rap for the right price and is probably what Shakespeare had in mind when he made that crack about killing all the lawyers.  Flynn's formula is simple: turn the client into a media darling, spin a tragic tale of the good girl ruined by bad choices, and an aquittal is certain.""Chicago"" is a musical, and the film uses a gimmick of establishing two worlds: the real Chicago and a surreal fantasy world in the form of a Jazz-Age theater, where the song and dance takes place.  In many musicals this wouldn't work, but here it makes sense. Director Rob Marshall fuses the two worlds together very well, creating images that compliment each other effectively.  Some of the concepts look like things you'd see in an editorial cartoon: a press conference becomes a ventroliquist act and puppet show, a trial is depicted as a literal circus.  Others offer a reflection of the character's inner self: Amos, in the guise of a baggy-pants comic, bemoans the fact that, like all second banannas, nobody really notices him--even the fantasy audience seems indifferent to his performance (which is, in truth, wonderful).The ensemble all turns in excellent performances in the acting category, but the singing is more uneven.  Zeta-Jones has by far the best voice of the leads, as exemplified by the casually sensual ""All That Jazz.""  Zelweiger is passable, mostly because one gets the impression that her Roxie has more charm and determination than actual talent.  Gere only barely manages with the music, and does so mainly on the grounds that Billy Flynn isn't one of the more vocally difficult roles in the music theater cannon.  But what he lacks in pipes he makes up for in the character department: his Flynn is a perfectly charismatic scoundrel, one whose talent and danger is in his ability to be so charming.  Taye Diggs, who presides over the dream world as the Bandleader, doesn't get to sing, which is a shame because he can--he was in the original cast of ""Rent""--but works very well with what he's given.The mix of glitter and grime in ""Chicago"" is reminicent of last year's ""Moulin Rouge,"" but those who thought the latter too excessive will probably find this one more appealing.  Any fan of music theater, however, will not want to miss this film--it may just be the rebirth of the movie musical we've been hearing about."
American Beauty,1999,8.3,A sexually frustrated suburban father has a mid-life crisis after becoming infatuated with his daughter's best friend.,"Reviewers say 'American Beauty' is acclaimed for its exploration of suburban discontent and the American Dream, highlighting themes of happiness and middle-class emptiness. Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening's performances are frequently praised, along with the film's cinematography, score, and screenplay. However, some critics find the characters and situations overly cynical or exaggerated, and a few argue it relies too heavily on clich√©s. The complexities of human relationships are also a key theme in the film."
The English Patient,1996,7.4,"At the close of World War II, a young nurse tends to a badly burned plane crash victim. His past is shown in flashbacks, revealing an involvement in a fateful love affair.","I like this movie above all others. It is ""multi-layered""; there is so much to see and appreciate. Every viewing brings a new appreciation of the story-line, the plot and the characters. Faultlessly acted and extremely enjoyable if you take the time to watch it and appreciate it. I love the interaction between the players; the subtle relationships; the period atmosphere. Ralph Fiennes is perfectly cast as the brooding lover and Geoffrey the wronged husband is beautifully underplayed by Colin Firth. The scene in the sand storm where Catherine & El-masy are discussing the different types of sand storms is one of the high-lights of the film and where the affair really starts. The other relationship between Hanna & El-masy is yet another ""layer"" of the movie which is totally enchanting (and heart-rending). A worthy winner of so many awards."
Dances with Wolves,1990,8.0,A lieutenant assigned to a remote Civil War outpost starts questioning his purpose after making contact with a neighboring Sioux settlement.,"What the heck are people thinking!  There are way too many Costner bashers on the internet.  This was a revolutionary motion picture at its time, never has a story about the American indians ever been told with such emotion and grace.   What a sham.  For the record Costner is not that bad of an actor.9/10"
Kramer vs. Kramer,1979,7.8,"After his wife leaves him, a work-obsessed Manhattan advertising executive is forced to learn long-neglected parenting skills, but a heated custody battle over the couple's young son deepens the wounds left by the separation.","This was one movie that I always wanted to watch but never got around to it. I have just finished it, and the main thing that caught my attention was how neutral and unjudgmental this movie was, because it would have been very easy, and I would say easier, for the director to give us a more biased view of the happenings on the screen. However, I strongly am sided with one of the parents, but the inner dialogues I had with myself during the movie were very interesting to observe.Overall, nice story, beautifully scripted and superbly acted. A must watch."
Titanic,1997,7.9,"A seventeen-year-old aristocrat falls in love with a kind but poor artist aboard the luxurious, ill-fated R.M.S. Titanic.","Reviewers say 'Titanic' is celebrated for its epic love story and stunning visual effects, particularly the recreation of the sinking ship. Praised for Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's performances and chemistry, the film also garners attention for its historical detail and portrayal of class differences. However, some criticize its melodramatic elements, perceived historical inaccuracies, and length. Despite these criticisms, many acknowledge its cultural impact and status as a phenomenon."
Babel,2006,7.5,"Tragedy strikes a married couple on vacation in the Moroccan desert, which jump starts an interlocking story involving four different families.","Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu's two previous films, Amores Perros and 21 Grams, dealt with the subject of very different people being connected on a small scale. Babel takes a different approach, but has the same central theme. The plot follows four different stories that stretch the entire globe (Morocco, Japan, Mexico and a few minutes in America) and shows how one single bullet can effect the lives of people so far apart. Guillermo Arriaga's script is breathtaking and perfectly structures this vast array of characters. Within minutes of being with them, we know exactly who they are and what drives their current personality. This gives time for the epic story to play out.It's all centered around two young boys who are fooling around with a rifle and accidentally shoot American tourist Susan (Cate Blanchett) who is on ""vacation"" with her husband Richard (Brad Pitt). Though never directly saying it, it's quite clear that one of their son's died and Richard panicked and left his family behind; leaving Susan to care for their two remaining children. He came back and their vacation to Morocco was really just an excuse for them to get away and try to get their marriage back together. Ultimately it does bring them back to each other, but it takes tragedy to do so. Brad Pitt's performance is one of the finest of 2006 and his internal pain and emotional strength manage to bring a river of tears flowing from my eyes. It's his best performance since Twelve Monkeys and further proves that through all of the controversy of his social life, he's still a phenomenal actor. Back in America, their nanny Amelia (Adriana Barraza) is taking care of their two children while they are gone. Through unfortunate circumstances she has to bring them to Mexico for her son's wedding and things take a huge turn for the worse when they try to cross back over into America.The final story is a much further departure from the rest of the characters. It centers around a deaf-mute Japanese schoolgirl named Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi) who struggles with the pain of being so different from everyone else along with her mother's apparent suicide and the police's attempt at questioning her father about a gun he gave to a Moroccan man (the gun used to shoot Susan).While most people believe that the film is about how people living so close to each other can be so different, I actually feel that it's the exact opposite. I think it's a story of how people so far apart (on different continents, speaking different languages) are almost exactly alike. All of the stories center around similar themes; loneliness, alienation, depression, the loss of a loved one and more while Arriaga never forgets to subtly mention the political outrage that comes from an American woman being shot in a foreign country. Every character feels the same emotions, deals with similar pain and are all connected by this single shooting. Babel starts off as a film about very different people in very different worlds, but ends up being one studying human nature and showing that even when we're worlds apart people we can still be so similar. All you have to do is listen."
Ocean's Thirteen,2007,6.9,"Danny Ocean rounds up the boys for a third heist after casino owner Willy Bank double-crosses one of the original eleven, Reuben Tishkoff.","""The robb'd that smiles, steals something from the thief."" Shakespeare's OthelloAndy Garcia's wealthy Terry Benedict is financing Danny Ocean's Vegas heist from casino owner Willie Bank (Al Pacino) in order to get the last smile of vengeance, thief to thief, while Danny and Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) exact their own revenge. No honor among these slick reprobates, and good time is had by all the men and, this time, not Julia Roberts, but Clooney's real-life squeeze, Ellen Barkin, as Abigail Sponder, tough right hand to Bank.I go to most movies as a film critic with my sensibility well-guarded against the fluffy confection of just another heist. But the Ocean's franchise, like the Bond's, has a cachet all its own with eye-pleasing duds, high-tech high jinx, and self-referential dialogue. Thus I am free to enjoy without feeling as if I'd sold out to crass commercialism¬óI have, but willfully and pleasurably.I guess I'm sucked in like everyone else at the movies, even with as many as I've seen and written about, because I want to go where the director, in this case the estimable Steven Soderbergh, wants to take me. In Ocean's 12, it was all over Europe; in Thirteen it's the entertainment Mecca of the Western world.No deep thoughts come to mind, just summer mindlessness dressed up for partying (Pitt and Clooney very nicely decked out, understatedly). Clooney's musings about the changes in Vegas since guys like him had shaken Sinatra's hand serves as ""change"" leitmotif lighter than air. Twenty years from now we'll be talking about the iconic Pitt and Clooney in the same nostalgic way. Ocean's Thirteen reinforces its place in popular culture as a repository for our transitory adulation of movie stars and the escapes they gave us long ago.At the end, Matt Damon exits with ""See you when I see you,"" a fitting piece of noncommittal that may promise another Ocean's installment or just more star sightings. Clooney says goodbye to Pitt with an in-joke the world is in on: ""Hey! Next time! Keep the weight off. Pitt retorts, ""Have a couple of kids."" This is typical of the low-key, sweetly narcissistic third installment.Ocean's hits a lucky thirteen this time around without a big jackpot but a great deal of good will."
Red Dragon,2002,7.2,"A retired FBI agent with psychological gifts is assigned to help track down ""The Tooth Fairy"", a mysterious serial killer. Aiding him is imprisoned forensic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter.","Only having seen ""Manhunter"" once, years ago, and not remembering much about it, I won't attempt to compare that film to it's remake, ""Red Dragon"". I've also never read any of the Thomas Harris novels that they are based on, so I won't compare them to the books either. But I will compare it to the other, more recent films in the Hannibal Lecter series, ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Hannibal"".I think most would agree that, ""Silence..."" is a classic. It's one of those movies where everything came together beautifully. The director, the actors, the story, etc. It's to serial killer, suspense films as ""The Godfather"" is to mafia movies. I feel the only other movie of it's type to have even come close after ""Silence of the Lambs""' release was ""Se7en"" with Morgan Freeman & Brad Pitt. So, it was with a lot of disappointment that I left the theater after seeing the long awaited sequel to ""SOTL"",  ""Hannibal"". Jodie Foster didn't return to play the part of Clarice Starling, Jonathon Demme didn't direct, and worst of all, Sir Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter was almost cartoonish. On top of that, the film was just ""ugly"". It felt nastier and dirtier than it's predecessor. More concerned with gore and blood than telling a decent story.Well, I'm happy to report that ""Red Dragon"" has put the series back on track. This time around, Hopkins plays Hannibal, more as we first remember seeing him in ""SOTL"". meaning more subtlety and slyness and less of the scenery chewing and over-acting that went on in ""Hannibal"". Edward Norton is just fine as FBI agent, Will Graham, who puts Lecter behind bars and then comes out of retirement to help solve the case of ""The Tooth Fairy"". Ralph Fiennes gives a very creepy and effective performance as Francis Dolarhyde, so good is he IMHO, that I expect him to get an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor next year. It helps that his character is more fleshed out, pardon the pun, than Ted Levine's serial killer in ""SOTL"".The director, Brett Ratner, has done a fine job of ending, (hopefully), this series on a high note. I say, hopefully, because as much as I enjoyed ""SOTL"" and now, ""Red Dragon"", one more trip to this well, will probably produce nothing but mud.The only thing that stands in the way of higher praise on my part, is that it's a sequel, er prequel, to a well loved and admired film. We've seen some of these characters and situations before. The meetings between Graham and Lecter are good, but they don't enthrall me the way they did between Starling and Lecter. All in all, a  fine job on everyone's part. It may not be as groundbreaking as the original ""SOTL"", but it has helped to wash away the ""bad taste"", sorry, left behind by ""Hannibal""."
Cleaner,2007,6.1,A former cop who now earns a wage as a crime scene cleaner unknowingly participates in a cover-up at his latest job.,"This is a fun, relatively forgettable little flick. I saw a documentary on real life cleaners of this sort, and that is a nasty business.Samuel L Jackson does a good job, like he normally does. Cleaner is entertaining, and I think it does a pretty decent job sucking you into the story. Eva Mendes walks around looking like some computer animated hottie (that's just how she looks!) and also gets the job done.OK, let me address the elephant in the living room, here.. How did Renny Harlin go from something easily watchable and entertaining like this, to The Legend of Hercules? I just don't get that. Moving on.Cleaner won't keep you up at night, it probably won't be your all time favorite, but you are entertained while it lasts. Watching Jackson clean and talk about cleaning is pretty fun."
Ocean's Twelve,2004,6.5,Daniel Ocean recruits one more team member so he can pull off three major European heists in this sequel to Ocean's Eleven (2001).,"I went into 'Oceans 12' as being a big fan of the first installment, but my hopes were not astronomical. And for the two or so hours that I watched the movie, I was not disappointed. However, I cannot say that I enjoyed it nearly as much as I had enjoyed 'Oceans 11'.'Oceans 12' was a very fun, but at the same time flawed, movie. The movie was every film students dream come true, full of indie style camera and editing tricks from beginning to end. But this could not hide the fact that at its core it was still a studio movie. The storyline was entertaining and full of just as many twists and turns as had graced the first one. However, when the final credits rolled I could not help but wonder about some of the loose ends (and there were many). It almost felt as though the scriptwriter had too many ideas that really did not fit with one another, but he threw them in anyway. At times it could be a little frustrating and leave you wondering why they even showed the last ten minutes of the movie.By far the strong suit of the film was the cast and their generally above par performances. Brad Pitt was excellent again, and Matt Damon was probably even better then he had been in '11'. The rest of the gang was about as they had been previously, with the possible exception of Shaobo Qin whom I felt was even funnier this time around. Catherine Zeta Jones turned out to be a welcome addition and she fit right in with the movies flow as Pitt's love interest. She perhaps looked the most comfortable in her role out of all of them, despite the fact that it was her first hand in the series.All in all, I was pleased that I had spent the eight dollars to go and see this the day that it opened. But by the same token, I doubt I will be purchasing it when it appears on DVD.My Overall Rating: 6 1/2 out of 10"
Run Lola Run,1998,7.6,"After a botched money delivery, Lola has 20 minutes to come up with 100,000 Deutschmarks.","People seem to get to easily impressed by films these days. No, I'm not a grouch, and I did like this film. Quite a bit actually, even though I'd basically seen the same film a few years ago: D.A.N.G.A.N. Runner, an HK film, predates Lola and is quite similar for the running throughout the film to live/save life etcetera aspect. Not to mention films like Flirt which deal with the same roles in different situations or Sliding Doors with the 'what if...?' aspect.So this film, though interesting, was hardly new. It takes ideas already seen and twists them just a little bit. But it lacks the characterization and plot that made those other films so interesting. We learn very little about Lola, just a few snippets from her encounters with her 'father' and the bed sequences with her boyfriend, who we learn even less about. And the plot is all about cinematography and film style, there's little essence to it. In other words, it's eye candy and little more.What that means is that we see great colour with little flavour. Experimentation with technique and style, sometimes it works other times it gets quite sloppy, and not enough attention to fine detail or story. (the cartoon part is cool though). And I would have liked a less Hollywood ending from a film that tries so hard to be contemporary and non-Hollywood.Overall: Fun to watch. Some of the experimentation really worked. It's hardly a classic though, not even a terribly solid film. But it's interesting, and doesn't drag *too* much. I almost gave it a 6 but relented and instead give it a 7/10."
Hannibal,2001,6.8,"Living in exile, Dr. Hannibal Lecter tries to reconnect with now disgraced F.B.I. Agent Clarice Starling, and finds himself a target of revenge from a powerful victim.","It's alarming and viscerally gross in ways that the first never even reaches for (mainly because it didn't need to). Yes, Foster is sorely missed, particularly earlier in the film. On the flip side, Liotta, who was consistently and criminally underrated in almost everything he did, just kills it - his performance at the dinner table is unnerving, hilarious, kitschy, powerful, and completely compelling."
Cube,1997,7.1,A group of strangers awaken to find themselves placed in a giant cube. Each one of them is gifted with a special skill and they must work together to escape an endless maze of deadly traps.,"It probably cost about half the budget of this movie, to make the opening sequence, which successfully gets your attention. Once it has your attention it simply refuses to let you go, it is compelling to say the least.The entire cast were pretty much unknown when the film was made (and most still are), but they all gave fine performances throughout. Without the successful casting this film could have easily been a disaster, as it is almost entirely character driven. I'm glad to say that definitely is not the case.Despite the low budget and practically unknown cast, the film manages to be clever, intriguing, thought-provoking and highly enjoyable. sadly, this film is probably a one off, i can't think of another low budget film that has half the impact of this one.8/10 and worth every point"
Lore,2012,7.1,"As the Allies sweep across Germany, Lore leads her siblings on a journey that exposes them to the truth of their parents' beliefs. An encounter with a mysterious refugee forces Lore to rely on a person she has always been taught to hate.","Director/writer Cate Shortland has created something truly remarkable, forcing us to find within ourselves sympathy for a young Nazi. The story is grim and dense, but features one hell of a lead performance. Shortland combines wonderful visuals with a brutal story of survival, involving family and patriotism, and a running commentary on the state of Germany after the fall of the Third Reich.As the German army collapses in the spring of 1945, the breakdown of a family serves as a microcosm of a country in despair in the closing days of World War II. Lore (Saskia Rosendahl) and her four younger siblings are abandoned as their Nazi- supporting parents are forced to flee the Allied forces. As they travel on foot to their grandmother's house in Hamburg, the children encounter a young Jewish refuge, Thomas, on whom they are forced to rely for both food and safe passage through Ally-occupied lands. As she is exposed to the lies of their parents, and begins to develop feelings for one whom she has been taught to hate, Lore is forced to come to terms with a belief system that is quickly unraveling.It's the children that have to do all the heavy lifting in the film dramatically, and they carry their weight, and then some. The film is anchored by a remarkable lead performance from Rosendahl, who comes across as a seasoned veteran, despite this being her debut performance. Her character goes from obnoxious adolescent to young adult, via a series of confronting moments where her morals and beliefs are challenged. Her vibrant youthful spirit is replaced with a burning rage with a war torn Europe as the backdrop.A new perspective on an event often forces an audience to confront disturbing realities they may wish to avoid. Although ""Lore"" relates a story from the second world war, it reveals the point of view of those we do not often consider: children of a high-ranking Nazi official. This story may not be pleasant, but it is certainly fascinating."
Year One,2009,4.9,"After being banished from their tribe, two hunter-gatherers encounter Biblical characters and eventually wind up in the city of Sodom.","Saw this at a matin√©e yesterday, with very lowered expectations. Don't quite get all the hate on here for it. If you like Jack Black and Michael Cera, they perform as expected here, loudmouthed braggart and wimpy foil, respectively. Amazing cast...David Cross as Cain and Paul Rudd as Abel? Inspired. Oliver Platt as a hairy-chested high priest? The ""McLovin"" Kid? There's even a member of Upright Citizens Brigade who puts in a very brief cameo. The story is dumb, and there's a few jokes that fall flat...but the sets are impressive and everyone involved seems to be having fun. A good rental, at least. But you people that are rating it a 1? Save your venom for movies that deserve that, like ""Meet The Spartans"" (unwatchable) or the latest Michael Bay atrocity."
Burn After Reading,2008,7.0,A disk containing mysterious information from a CIA agent ends up in the hands of two unscrupulous and daft gym employees who attempt to sell it.,"Burn After Reading is a weird movie. It takes everything that makes a good spy flick and turn it on its head. You can't help but incredulously laugh at what happens. This is all about oddballs.The good. Excellent acting. Totally off the wall characters, actions and situations, yet completely logical. Story with twists within twists. Well paced scenario. Solid dialogs. Nice action.The actors. George Clooney, Frances McDormand, Brad Pitt, and John Malkovich play disturbingly crazy roles stuffed with delusion and heavily dosed with stupidity. While Richard Jenkins, David Rasche, and J.K. Simmons seem almost out of place as the standard bearers of reason.The bad. Since it's so bizarre, it won't please everyone.The ugly. Nothing.The result. Offbeat and cooky comedy. Don't think you'll see your run of the mill kind of film and you'll have fun."
Holy Motors,2012,7.0,"A man boards a limousine to be driven to his day's work: nine mysterious ""appointments.""","The first thing to do with this film is to dump the memory of the gushing but rather non-specific praise from critics, the perfect 10 out of 10 scores and the banner ""film of the year"", because having all of that on the head of the film will really not help it or you. I say this because although it was for critics, the casual viewer will certainly not make this film of the year in the traditional sense, because it is very much an experience. People have said that it is a film that you love or hate (as can be seen in the extreme gushing or spitting in some comments) but for me it is both and neither at once.The plot (although it is also worth putting that notion out of your head too) is that a man is transported around in a limousine in Paris, being dropped off at different locations to fulfill a series of appointments. If you can get over the ridiculous sight of traffic moving freely in Paris, you will still need to work with the fact that these appointments range from acting like a tramp in the middle of busy street, acting out a weird alien love scene in a mo-cap suit, killing someone and taking their identity, being a frustrated father to a teenage girl and other such random things. These events range hugely in what they did to me. Between different episodes and indeed within different episodes I went from amusement to bemusement; from engaged to bored; from interested to frustrated ‚Äì and for all of these I also went back the other way in some cases. It is a film that is frustrating and quite good at the same time. It is a total art film and it really has no interest in anyone who expects it to do anything to help the viewer. Personally I dislike this approach although I recognize that some love difference and uniqueness for just those qualities ‚Äì it working or being good is a distant second.I really tried to find the meaning in the film but it was too obscured for me and I was too remote for it to get to me. I have read quite a few reviews from those that love the film but they have been generally vague and non-specific in their praise, almost as if they really want to love it for how diverse and unique it is, but aren't able to put their finger on its good qualities despite this. This is not to say that I did not appreciate these qualities as well ‚Äì just that for me they are not enough. So yes I quite enjoyed creative aspects to it, or some of the events and situations, but generally it just seemed too fragmented, too lacking in anything tangible and ultimately it just felt like it was being difficult and surreal for the sake of it, not as the path to a goal. I'm sure some were thrilled watching the character stand shaking a tin at passing strangers, or exhilarated by two people in mo-cap suits dry humping each other, or entertained by the sight of a silent Eva Mendes abducted by a naked crazy guy with an erection but such things did not work for me. There is something in there I am sure about cinema as we do get reference to cameras and other films, but as I say, it was too little, too obscured for me.Visually the film has imagination and style, while the performance of Lavant is enthusiastic and committed, but these are not the content. I'm sure Mendes and Minogue both get a little career benefit from being on the inside of such a project, but for Mendes it was a waste although Minogue's section was nicely done. This is not a film for performances though and, outside of Lavant, there really isn't much to talk about. If you enjoy wildly weird and odd films on the basis that they are weird and odd, then you'll like this and will maybe even pat yourself on the back for being clever enough to enjoy it (even if you struggle to put that enjoyment into specific words). However those looking for more will be disappointed and many may hate the film; personally I found aspects to like and much to engage, but ultimately it didn't work for me as a whole and too much worked against it at the same time."
Here Comes the Boom,2012,6.4,A high-school biology teacher looks to become a successful mixed martial arts fighter in an effort to raise money to prevent extracurricular activities from being axed at his cash-strapped school.,"The King of Queens is at it again and he hit this one out of the park! Salma Hayek also put in a fun performance as did Henry Winkler. Kevin's real life brother offered up some of the funnier moments dealing with domestic realities. Every character in this film made me laugh until it hurt. This film is a sure crowd pleaser as it has the Asians, Hispanics and the white crowd both old and young covered quite well. Most of the comedy is from the older actors in this film so I think the older crowd will appreciate this film as much as teens will. At times you know you are watching a comedy. At other points you know there is good heart touching drama added in with a comedic touch. And then when the fighting kicks in you feel like you are watching a real fight. If you have a heart for music studies you will cheer these characters on! If you enjoy the UFC/MMA fighting then you'll have a blast watching Kevin James dive into this world and get/give a good whooping! A lot of the real players/announcers/refs from UFC are in this film adding to the feel of a real UFC match. It's a smart film in it's comedic moments. On the other hand, as contrived and predictable as many elements in this story are, you will still find yourself cheering the players on and maybe even feel your eyes water due to feelings from either end of the emotional spectrum. I had given up on comedy films in recent years as most of them our just way too raunchy. But the PG rating on this film...I applaud all those behind this production. This movie works and it will make anyone laugh!"
Wrath of the Titans,2012,5.7,"Perseus braves the treacherous underworld to rescue his father, Zeus, captured by his son, Ares, and brother Hades who unleash the ancient Titans upon the world.","The powers of the gods are dwindling and the gods are slowly fading into oblivion. Monsters are being raised from wherever. Buildings are sliding all around the place. And there is no reason to care about ANY of it.Ares and Hades are villains just as we've seen in nearly EVERY Greek mythology based storyline. I just want to pound my head against the wall every time I see this cinematic flatulence.The love interest from the first movie is gone and instead of recasting the part, they just kill off the character. Bobo the Owl makes another cameo in this movie, playing the role of Wilson the Volleyball from Castaway. The blue ents are gone... I guess the action figures must not have sold that well.When the Titan emerges (and it is the ONLY titan in the movie), he looks like the lava Titan from Disney's Hercules. The Titan shouts a lot, but hell if I could ever understand a word he said.At least Perseus doesn't look like he came from the Jarhead Clan anymore. But he is still an idiot. Zeus comes to him in the beginning of the story to tell him that the world is coming to an end and he needs his help. Perseus refuses because... get this... he refuses to leave his son. Apparently despite having god blood in his veins he is still unable to think far enough in advance to realize that if the world comes to an end, he'll be leaving his son permanently.The roles of Hades, Zeus and Hephaestus were really good, but three good performances just could not save this turkey from its bad writing and a dreadfully boring plot riddled with clich√©s."
From Paris with Love,2010,6.4,"In Paris, a young employee in the office of the US Ambassador hooks up with an American spy looking to stop a terrorist attack in the city.","Would I watch this movie again? Yes I was not sure what to expect from this movie. But, I decided to watch it. And long and behold, its one which you should not miss if you are into guy movies like me. Lots of action, good lines, fast pace and a bit of a story. What else can a guy ask for? More hot chick scene? Action: Travolta has all the moves and faster then all the bullets which blast by him. He kicks butt and then some.Speech and dialogue: There were one liners, yes. But the fast talking Travolta was entertaining and was very complimentary with his co-stars Chemistry and pace: The characters were good with each other. Meyers and wife was good. Made me believe. The action and fast talking move the movie along. From building to building, it was good to have different locations to kill bad guys.Story and Plot: Its all there in the synopsis, where a guy wants more action and he got it.Hotties and love scenes: just one simple sceneEnding: Ending is good as I feel like it completed the movie. No real loose ends. (I hate movies where the ending leaves you dissatisfied)"
Comme un chef,2012,6.6,"A veteran chef faces off against his restaurant group's new CEO, who wants to the establishment to lose a star from its rating in order to bring in a younger chef who specializes in molecular gastronomy.","Did I already say that I love cooking and films about cooking? I probably did. For food lovers talking, reading, watching TV shows and - why not - seeing movies about food and the people behind food just amplifies the pleasure of enjoying good food and enriches the experience. We have been blessed with a few good movies on this topic, some older (who can forget Louis de Funes in L'Aille et la cuisse?) some recently like the American Chef with an almost identical title as the French comedy Le Chef.We may of course expect a lot from a French film about 'haute cuisine' - the subject should be part of the national expertise after all. Director and script co-writer Daniel Cohen has taken the easy path with this lighthearted comedy about a famous chef (Jean Reno) who is obsessed with keeping his three Michelin stars intact and an unemployed aspirant (Michael Youn) trying to find his way in the world of high-end cooking. Everybody has a good time and especially Reno who abandons for a short while his tough guy mask and lets us know that he owns a carefully suppressed comic talent.There is some serious background behind the light comedy which should not be omitted. Great chefs nowadays need to fight increased competition from street food and from the modern trends like 'molecular food' (which incidentally I hate as much as the folks who wrote the script of this film). Fighting kitsch or pretentious avant-garde artistic challenge that is not encountered only by artists in cooking but by many other fields. So are the crisis of creativity, the loss of inspiration, the need to change and do something else in certain turning points of lives and careers. None of these subjects are absent but none is explored to deeply either in 'Le Chef'. The result in culinary terms is a 'souffle' - light and pleasant when eaten but not leaving persistent memories after the consumption. I mentioned the American movie 'Chef' which also dealt with a famous cook in some crisis in his life and career turning to street food. Well, the food in the American 'Chef' may not have been as classy as the food in the French 'Le Chef' but the film that resulted was better."
Midnight in Paris,2011,7.6,"While on a trip to Paris with his fianc√©e's family, a nostalgic screenwriter finds himself mysteriously going back to the 1920s every day at midnight.","As crazy as it may be, this is the first Allen film I have ever seen, and after watching this, I am definitely going to watch all of his others. This kind of film makes me wonder how we can be happy with rom coms where we know the films entire plot from the advert. I was completely caught by surprise at the romantic, clever, intriguing, funny, interesting and thoroughly well written script. I had no idea about the plot and was happily led by Wilson's character into the depths of Paris' magical midnight strike. Other actor's involved did a great job too. I was particularly impressed with McAdams as it just adds to her ability to play any role. I think overall I'm simply in awe at the film. It's a classic. A really refreshing idea, gently portrayed in an almost realistic way, like this French magic really does exist. The music and scenery adds to the charm of the film and the subtle humour is a nice touch too. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and will watch this over and over again for years to come. Along with Manhattan, Match Point, Annie Hall...."
Top Gun,1986,7.0,"The Top Gun Naval Fighter Weapons School is where the best of the best train to refine their elite flying skills. When hotshot fighter pilot Maverick is sent to the school, his reckless attitude and cocky demeanor put him at odds with the other pilots, especially the cool and collected Iceman.","There are few movies that are considered classics that I have yet to see, but Top Gun was one of them. I was pretty tired of hearing the endless references and not understanding them, so I decided to finally sit down and give it a shot. It's enjoyable, but I think it was more of a product of it's time. It's better appreciated as an 80's film than a film in general. Now I don't mean that the effects don't hold up, because they do. I just feel like it had all the fruit at the right time, where as now some of them might be expired or just not as popular. Whether it was 'Take My Breath Away', a smash hit at the time, or Tom Cruise, a blossoming superstar actor, Top Gun is a good movie that was definitely considered great back in the day.Maverick, one of the most famous film characters of all time, learns to become not just a better Navy pilot, but a more well rounded man. Tom Cruise has been better for sure but he has some fun with this role. But when you look at Collateral and even last years Edge of Tomorrow, Cruise is a legitimate actor, but I think at this point in his career he was just trying to make it big. He's extremely cocky and not particularly fond of anybody trying to tell him what to do. He needs wisdom and a life altering event that humbles him. Well he definitely gets both of those. But his cockiness is why the character became so famous. It's one of the main reasons why I think a sequel could be both great and potentially unnecessary. We go on a journey with Maverick throughout the film. A journey that changes his character quite a bit, so I'm not sure a second look at his character works. On the other-hand, knowing where his character ends up, it can be an interesting passing of the torch story if you will.What I think was missing here was more of a back story with Maverick. We get a little bit with his father and a quick remark about his mother, but I would have liked to see more of how he became so cocky and conceded. I did enjoy the romance between Cruise and Kelly McGinnis, who has some of the most stunning eyes you will ever see. You can tell she was one of the few people that could get to him and help him through all the troubles he ends up going through.+Effects hold up+Kilmer and McGinnis' performance+Music-Needed more back story-Too much of an 80's product7.0/10"
Salmon Fishing in the Yemen,2011,6.8,A fisheries expert is approached by a consultant to help realize a sheik's vision of bringing the sport of fly-fishing to the desert and embarks on an upstream journey of faith and fish to prove the impossible possible.,"A rich sheik has decided that he would like to bring the faith and sport of fly-fishing to Yemen. British fisheries expert, Dr. Alfred Jones (Ewan McGregor), thinks it's a joke. But the PM likes the idea of positive Anglo-Yemeni cooperation and the 2 million potential voters who fish. Dr. Jones still thinks it's a joke. The sheik transfers $50 Million over to his consultant's firm, and thus the project begins.Dr. Jones still thinks it's a joke. And that is where the film shines. The filmmakers don't really treat it as if it's a true story and keep the humour sharp throughout. It's more closely related to a light-hearted romantic comedy rather than a sharp-edged political memoir. But again, this is where it shines, because it's so much better than a light-hearted romantic comedy. McGregor nails his serious character, allowing us to experience his whimsical sense of humour beneath his scientific demeanor. It's a character that I instantly connected with and it has never been better written or portrayed as it was here.To me, the second best character was Sheikh Muhammed (Amr Waked). (Although at this point most people would prefer to mention the foul-mouthed press secretary by Kristin Scott Thomas). The sheikh splits his time between the desert of Yemen and the beautiful flowing streams through the mountains and glens of Scotland. He wants to bring the serenity and faith that fly-fishing brings to his people in the Middle East. Dr. Jones fishes but he is not religious. The sheikh found this a very confusing dichotomy in his character until they both realized that faith is not the same thing as religion.""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" is very funny and approaches political satire level. We know, and Dr, Jones knows, that fish do not survive in the desert. So obviously this is all a big joke, but as we also all know, money and power outweigh common sense. But it starts becoming clear that this might actually work after we realize that the sheikh is driven by faith ‚Äì not religion, nor money. And the media comes in and creates war heroes and emotions out of nothing. As I said, the film is very funny but it doesn't skewer the politicians or media as much as we would want them to. At that point it becomes a romantic comedy.The genre shouldn't really matter though because it's so cute and charming, and enjoyable on every level. I'm assuming the book focuses more on the political and engineering maneuvers required to bring salmon to Yemen; here we just stuck with the characters. But I loved these characters."
Silver Linings Playbook,2012,7.7,"After a stint in a mental institution, former teacher Pat Solitano moves back in with his parents and tries to reconcile with his ex-wife. Things get more challenging when Pat meets Tiffany, a mysterious girl with problems of her own.","While most romantic comedies usually contain bad acting, sappiness, and a large amount of predictable moments; Silver Linings Playbook is the exact opposite. There may be a little amount sappiness in this movie but there is bound to be some in any romantic situations. In reality though, all of the sap in Silver Linings Playbook can be overlooked due to the fact that the film is completely original, extremely funny, and contains outstanding acting from the two lead roles.Written and directed by David O. Russell (The Fighter), Silver Linings Playbook is about a man, played by Bradley Cooper (Limitless, The Hangover), who was just released from an eight month stint in a psychiatric hospital. He wants to get his life back on track but is being held back by his parents and his unstable condition. After a little while, he strikes up an interesting friendship with a female played by Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone, The Hunger Games). Both of these characters are going through somewhat of the same type of problems which makes their friendship even more quirky and thought-provoking.Because a large amount of romantic comedies are stale and overdone, Silver Linings Playbook is a breath of fresh air. Usually movies in this genre follow a very particular road map that entails: man is at rock bottom but then finds the perfect girl. After a while, man loses girl and must win girl back in a very clich√© and unrealistic fashion. What's original about Silver Linings Playbook is that it doesn't follow that mediocre story line in the slightest making it unpredictable but at the same time, more relateable. Chris Tucker is in this movie and even he isn't predictable. Chris Tucker, the loud-mouthed actor who hasn't been in a film without the words 'Rush Hour' in the title for almost 15 years, was surprisingly mellow. Even though he was mellow, he was still very comedic and played a great role in the film.The most surprising aspect of Silver Linings Playbook, however, was the performance of Bradley Cooper. Even though this is a comedy, Cooper plays what is maybe one of the most serious roles he's ever performed. After audience members witness his work in this film, there shouldn't be any more doubt if the man can act or not. Silver Linings Playbook is without a doubt Cooper's best work thus far in his career. Jennifer Lawrence has a performance of equal caliber but that is expected from the young Academy Award nominated actress. What was surprising about Lawrence's role in the movie, was how adult it was. Fans of Lawrence's work may have been worried that she would be stuck in teenage roles after playing the character Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games, but she should silence those doubts after this film with a very adult, yet professional, performance.Silver Linings Playbook is full of creativity and minimal on romance clich√©s. It is hands down one of the best romantic comedies to be made within the last couple of years. This film contains many laugh out loud moments and a number of scenes that will warm your heart to the point where you can't help but leave the theater smiling. Silver Linings Playbook is the perfect date movie that both men and women can easily enjoy. A-"
Taxi 3,2003,5.8,"Out to stop a new gang disguised as Santa Claus, Emilien and Daniel must also handle major changes in their personal relationships.","The third chapter in the ‚ÄúTaxi‚Äù series is a definite step down from the second. Director G√©rard Krawczyk and screenwriter Luc Besson have managed to introduce some new elements to the franchise (a pre-credits Stallone cameo, a Bond-style title sequence, a gigantic 4 X 4 crashing everything on its path, bank robbers disguised as Santa Clauses, future parenthood, the action moving to the Swiss Alps in the last 20 minutes and Daniel's taxi functioning as a snowmobile, etc.) to justify making this sequel. However, Besson's script remains very thin (the film barely fills up 83 minutes, long closing credits included), and the absence of a climactic set-piece is especially disappointing. The characters still have appeal, and the introduction of exotic beauty Bai Ling is a plus; on the other hand, those expecting Emma Sj√∂berg to get involved in the action in the same way she was in ""Taxi 2"" should forget about it: her character is already 8 months pregnant as the movie opens.

Due Date,2010,6.5,High-strung father-to-be Peter Highman is forced to hitch a ride with aspiring actor Ethan Tremblay on a road trip in order to make it to his child's birth on time.,"The critics are being pretty harsh on this film, and yet they give high praise to such films like Role Models and Get Him to the Greek, so go figure. But I had a lot fun with Due Date, It was a fun slapstick misadventure, almost what we loved about The Hangover, so it is clear to say I don't agree with the critics on this one.Peter(Robert Downey Jr) an architect looking to get home to his pregnant wife(Michelle Monaghan) who is expecting in a week. And when he gets on a plane, he quickly gets kicked off, when he gets into an unfortunate incident with Ethan(Zach Galifianakis) a pot smoking moron, and wanna be actor, who is obsessed with the show Two and a Half Men. When Peter is looking for new ways to get home. Ethan has a car and offers to drive him. Although it is against Peters better judgment, but feeling there is no other way, he goes with him. Will Peter make it on time for his child's birth, or will Ethan drive him nuts during this?A lot of people said this is a Plane,Trains and Automobiles ripoff, but you know what who cares. This was a funny laugh out loud film. Downey and Galifianakis have funny chemistry, they just play off each other perfectly. Like The Hangover it is one entertaining misadventure, I say don't listen to the critics, see this movie and form your own opinion."
Ali G Indahouse,2002,6.2,"Ali G unwittingly becomes a pawn in the Chancellor's plot to overthrow the Prime Minister of Great Britain. However, Ali is embraced by the nation as a voice of the youth, making the PM and his government more popular than ever.","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsMovie adaptations of TV shows,books or magazines are rarely very good,but Ali G Indahouse is one of those pleasing exceptions to the rule.The set-up for the comedy has the local authority closing down the community centre where Ali works and him going on hunger strike outside the Houses of Parliament.When Prime Minister Michael Gambon decides he needs someone young and hip to gain a wider appeal to the activites of his party,Ali is just the man for the job.Ali introduces his 'Keep it Real' policy,to the anger of Charles Dance's dastardly right-hand man who's planning to build over Staines.The frank honesty of Sacha Baren Cohen's character and the clever satire enterwine beautifully together.Big up yourself and go see this movie.****"

I knew it would be a good comedy with R rated jokes and didn't know that it would be emotional too!My wife almost started crying in one scene and suddenly laughed like anything ..

I enjoyed the format, not knowing that previous episodes supposedly offered more/better car chases according to other commentators.The Inspector irritated me, until I bought into the Pink Panther / Insp. Jacques Clouseau homage (http://www.imdb.com/find?s=all&q=Pink+Panther&x=23&y=7) and ""Silence of the Lambs"" / Hannibal Lecter thing, then I just rode the wave of good humour and rollicking fun.This movie was always meant to be taken lightly rather than literally or (worse) earnestly."
The Campaign,2012,6.1,An incumbent Representative embroiled in personal scandal faces a no-holds-barred challenge from a naive newcomer funded by two unscrupulous billionaire lobbyist brothers.,"""The Campaign"" is not a film to show your kids, your mother or Father O'Malley if he stops by for the evening. Why? Because the film is incredibly crude and despite no nudity and only a little bit of violence (such as when a baby and Uggie the dog are punched in the face), it earns its R rating because it is so crude. All that being said, it is still a very enjoyable film...and worth seeing. Just don't tell others, because they might think less of you.The film is about a fictional congressional election between a dumb, sleazy womanizing incumbent (Will Ferrell) and a dumb, not as sleazy and very effeminate newbie (Zach Galifianakis). As the campaign progresses, the rhetoric between the pair becomes more and more sleazy and awful...to the point where it's simply ludicrous late in the story. Who will win and what about those rich jerks pulling the strings in this election?As I mentioned above, the film is very crude and adult....watch it at your own risk. But it also is funny and offers some interesting insights into American politics."
Borat,2006,7.4,Kazakh TV talking head Borat is dispatched to the United States to report on the greatest country in the world.,"For months, I could not go anywhere, see or read anything without hearing something about Borat: Cultural Learnings of American for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. It was being hailed as groundbreaking, and hilarious beyond anyone's wildest dreams. Everyone I knew wanted to see it, and I just stood back and could not understand what the big fuss was about. Yeah, it looked fairly amusing, but nothing more than that. Sacha Baron Cohen's Da Ali G Show never impressed me when I watched random episodes, so I was not in belief that this film would.But with all of the hype, it made me want to see it opening weekend. Unfortunately, I never managed to. I caught it a few weeks later without the benefit of a huge audience watching it with me. And for the most part, I think my original assumption was correct.Basically for the two people who have zero clue what the movie is about (despite it now being on DVD), Borat Sagdiyev (Cohen) is a Kazak journalist sent to the United States to observe the American way of life. He brings his TV crew with him every step of the way, and begins to explore the country. But because of his origin, he is outrageously obnoxious in his behaviour. But for some reason, it only becomes more tolerated as he continues on, allowing for many surprising responses from the people he comes across.The satirical idea for the film is simply brilliant. The character of Borat is racist, misogynist, raunchy, and just downright vile in the way he acts. And the Americans he talks to either do not realize what is going on, or actually agree with him. The tour he takes across the United States involves a plethora of random, everyday citizens being duped in this fashion. The fact that the film was marketed so well in the US, and then further made millions, attests to the idea that this may just be the greatest practical joke every played.But unfortunately, it is a one-note joke. The film loses steam after thirty minutes, and can barely pick up afterwards. It strikes a pretty solid barrier, and just cannot recover no matter how hard it tries. Yes, the proceeding minutes had their share of laughs and shocks, but nowhere near as much as the first little bit. It just sets itself up far too well, and fails to live up to its original design. Its nifty idea and execution really should have told people from the start that it would not work for a ninety minute long film, but I guess they had more faith in the picture than I did.Another upsetting thing about the film was the grand amount of preplanning. It was continually being sold to the audience as being spur-of-the-moment, and very uncoordinated. But as the film progresses, you can tell that some moments are actually being filmed this way, and that some reek of being rehearsed. It takes away from the satire the film had built up for itself, and really brings down the genuine enjoyment for the film. I know it had barely anywhere to go from the start, but making it almost so that it was written unnaturally before hand, just takes away from the genuine impact that the film has. The fact that the writing was nominated at the Oscars also does an effective amount of damage to the final moments of the film, which otherwise would have been drop dead funny instead of just amusing.The film-making techniques on the other hand, are just magical. You really get a sense of the gritty and grungy documentary look the filmmakers wanted from the minute the film starts, right up until its finale. The hand-held camera works beautifully in every sequence, and the very personal diary feel that the film gains during the second act works very well. Just trying to keep up with Cohen in certain scenes seemed to have been a test of endurance on its own. The film is very low budget, and it shows in how unique the film looks. If it had not been so heavily publicized, I think I actually would have had trouble deferring whether or not it was an actual documentary if I saw it while flipping through TV channels.There are no proper words to describe Cohen and his schtick. It really is a sight to marvel all on its own. His dedication and perfection in this role is nearly unheralded in my mind. He goes beyond transcending himself into the character. Every moral fibre of this character is ingrained in Cohen's performance. You do not see Cohen, and you do not see an actor. You see a rude and ignorant Kazak journalist. He never lets up for a second, and is always acting in character. This fictional character is brought to life with so much energy, that he actually forms into a real life person. The line between reality and fiction is just so thin here, that it really begs the question of how far an actor will go for his character. And he is absolutely hysterical to watch.Ken Davitian, who plays Borat's producer and sidekick Azamat, is also very good in his performance. He is almost always watching, and is so subtle. He never breaks a smile, and he is just so serious that he complements how perfect Cohen's character is. He is obviously not as strong an actor (and is barely understandable), but his valiant efforts do go rewarded.Even with its flaws, Borat is an experience everyone should take. Some may find it funnier than others, and some may not find it funny at all. There is a bit of a middle ground, but not much. And in the process of watching, everyone will be able to marvel at one of the greatest character performances ever committed to celluloid.7.5/10."
Tower Heist,2011,6.2,"When a group of hard-working guys find out they've fallen victim to their wealthy employer's Ponzi scheme, they conspire to rob his high-rise residence.","Tower Heist is Ben Stiller's latest comedy where he plays the building manager of a New York high rise tower block. He regrettably invests him and his staff's pension money with a smooth-talking crook who lives in the top floor penthouse. Naturally, the crook wastes their money and they're left without a cent.Therefore, Ben and a few other disgruntled employees, enlist the help of small time crook Eddie Murphy to break into the penthouse and steal back their money.It's a decent enough premise and, again, all the cast to a decent enough job. There you have it - it's a decent film. Not quite funny enough to be a comedy through and through. Not quite dramatic enough to be a straight drama. It even throws in a bit of a high speed car chase into the mix to add an element of 'action' into the genre.It's a bit of a mixed bag. If you go into it without any expectations, you should find it an okay watch.Not great, but not bad either. Fans of Stiller and Murphy should find extra things to enjoy about it."
The Hangover Part II,2011,6.5,"Two years after the bachelor party in Las Vegas, Phil, Stu, Alan, and Doug jet to Thailand for Stu's wedding, but Stu's plan for subdued pre-wedding brunch goes seriously awry.","The premise of The Hangover: Part II is nearly identical to the first ‚Äì the same ""wolfpack"" from the first movie, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Doug (Justin Bartha) and the not entirely welcome man- child, Alan (Zach Galifianakis), throw a wild, out-of-control bachelor party that results in the loss of an important character.At first blush, it seemed as though this movie, with its recycled premise and familiar characters another painfully obvious attempt to wring the last few cents out of a Hollywood cash cow. However, director Todd Phillips, easily quiets these criticisms by playfully mocking the similarities and by upping the raunchiness, insanity, and humor of the movie.Galifianakis once again steals the show as the perfectly crafted weirdo Alan, who's sporadic and bizarre interjections enliven momentary lulls in the movie. Alan's antics are further accentuated by the return of the humorous and insane criminal, Chow (Ken Jeong). Combined with new, shockingly outrageous situations, the duo keeps the laughs coming and in doing so gets the audience to forget the movie's lack of originality.Regardless of my strong recommendation, wholesome moviegoers and those who are wholeheartedly convinced that this movie is nothing but a remake should skip The Hangover: Part II because, to be honest, this isn't a movie to be taken seriously. It is not a cinematic masterpiece by any stretch and the storyline is weak at best, but if you're willing to venture into the bowels of Bangkok for a raunchy, silly, sophomoric, and extremely amusing movie, call up your wolf pack and head to see an amusing movie you'll never forget ‚Äì hopefully."
Spider-Man,2002,7.4,"After being bitten by a genetically-modified spider, a shy teenager gains spider-like abilities that he uses to fight injustice as a masked superhero and face a vengeful enemy.","One of the most successful translations of ""comic book to screen"" has fine results in SPIDER-MAN, a handsomely produced version of the comic book classic with a sprightly score by Danny Elfman and some incredibly realistic looking CGI effects.The simple plot of good vs. evil begins when Peter Parker is bitten by a spider while touring a local museum with his high school class. The plot thickens when he develops webs and the ability to soar over rooftops and vehicles with ease--as well as climbing walls. Toby Maguire plays the nerdy teen-ager with a wholesome air of innocent charm, his open-eyed expression never concealing the delight he takes in the role. As his girlfriend, Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst does a likable enough job even if the costume department decided to dress her like a teen hooker.Everyone else is in fine form. William Dafoe deserves top praise for his Green Goblin--evil enough to frighten the wits out of the faint-hearted. J. Jonah Jameson is excellent as the bombastic newspaper editor who takes advantage of his most famous client. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson, in quieter roles, are warm and human. James Franco is believable as Peter's best friend.Admirers of the comic book tales should have no trouble liking the movie with its amazing CGI effects. It's heart-warming and funny, with some terror thrown in for good measure. Good escapist entertainment even if the message seems a little vague. Message??"
American Psycho,2000,7.6,"A wealthy New York City investment banking executive, Patrick Bateman, hides his alternate psychopathic ego from his co-workers and friends as he delves deeper into his violent, hedonistic fantasies.","Reviewers say 'American Psycho' is a provocative film exploring consumerism and identity. Christian Bale's chilling performance as Patrick Bateman is highly praised. The film's dark humor and social commentary effectively critique 1980s yuppie culture. Its unsettling atmosphere is enhanced by stylish visuals and a haunting score. The supporting cast, including Willem Dafoe and Reese Witherspoon, contributes effectively, though some feel underutilized. The ambiguous nature of Bateman's actions adds to the film's disturbing impact."
Mississippi Burning,1988,7.8,Two FBI agents with wildly different styles arrive in Mississippi to investigate the disappearance of three civil rights activists.,"Reviewers say 'Mississippi Burning' is a powerful film tackling racism and civil rights in 1960s Mississippi, lauded for its strong performances by Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe. Its gripping narrative and Alan Parker's direction are highlighted. However, some criticize historical inaccuracies and character portrayals. Despite this, many view it as an important, thought-provoking film that effectively conveys the horrors of racial bigotry and the struggle for justice, making it a significant, albeit controversial, work on race relations in America."
Avatar,2009,7.9,A paraplegic Marine dispatched to the moon Pandora on a unique mission becomes torn between following his orders and protecting the world he feels is his home.,"Reviewers say 'Avatar' is celebrated for its stunning visual effects, immersive 3D experience, and innovative motion-capture technology. The depiction of Pandora and the Na'vi culture is frequently lauded. However, criticisms arise regarding the predictable plot, lack of originality, and clich√©d characters. Some find the story simplistic and reliant on familiar tropes, while others complain about the wooden dialogue. Despite these issues, many appreciate the film's emotional resonance and its strong messages about environmentalism and colonialism."
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,2007,5.6,The Fantastic Four learn that they aren't the only super-powered beings in the universe when they square off against the powerful Silver Surfer and the planet-eating Galactus.,"Reviewers say 'Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer' shows improvement with better effects and action but still disappoints. The Silver Surfer's introduction is praised, yet weak villains and inconsistent character arcs are noted. The story lacks depth, relying heavily on humor and special effects. Main cast performances are often underwhelming, though some exceptions exist. Despite being more entertaining than its predecessor, the film is criticized for not reaching its full potential."
The Man in the Iron Mask,1998,6.5,The cruel King Louis XIV of France has a secret twin brother whom he keeps imprisoned. Can the twin be substituted for the real king?,"Leonardo DiCaprio is ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" and also King Louis XIV in this re-telling of the famous Dumas story. He is surrounded in a sumptuous production by a stellar cast that includes Gabriel Byrne, John Malkovich, Gerard Depardieu and Jeremy Irons. The oft-filmed plot concerns the twin brother of the cruel, selfish Louis IV who is guarded loyally by D'Artagnan. Phillipe, the twin, was taken from his mother at birth and once found by the King, imprisoned and placed in an iron mask to hide his identity. When the poverty and the uprisings become too much, Aramis (Irons), who knows of Phillipe's existence, breaks him out of prison with the help of Porthos (Depardieu) and Athos (Malkovich) with the idea of having him replace Louis at an upcoming masquerade ball. It falls to Athos, who has just lost his son Raoul in war because of Louis' lust for Raoul's fianc√©e, to teach Philippe how to be king in a short time. Things do not go as planned.This tremendous cast and huge production make for absorbing viewing, different yet as entertaining as the Richard Chamberlain TV version and the Louis Hayward version in the 1930s. Here the emphasis is on the old Musketeers, which works well - Porthos who feels his age and misses the old lusts, the grieving Athos and Aramis, given an impossible job by Louis, which means that Louis must go; and, of course, D'Artagnan, fiercely loyal to his King and insisting that he can be molded into a great ruler, despite evidence to the contrary. The acting is fabulous - there really isn't a standout among the four men as they are all so good.Leonardo DiCaprio creates two completely different characters with Louis and Philippe and does an excellent job. Though he was trending toward matin√©e idol/chick flick territory, he pulled himself out to take on weightier roles - though there's no doubt this film was meant to bring in the teenagers. And what's wrong with that - a classic story once in a while won't kill them.Entertaining viewing."
Bridget Jones's Diary,2001,6.8,Bridget Jones is determined to improve herself while she looks for love in a year in which she keeps a personal diary.,"Bridget Jones's Diary is a surprisingly good movie.  Detractors who deride it for its admittedly minimalist plot miss the point - this is a film that shows life without the layers of artificiality favoured by directors (resulting in movies somehow removed from the realm of the everyday in which us mere mortals dwell).  Life is frequently aimless and trivial; and therein lies the movie's attraction.  Notwithstanding of course that this is a very funny and highly original comedy.Bridget (played with considerable aplomb by Renee Zellweger) belongs to the ranks of that modern phenomenon - the over-30, unmarried career woman. Just when it seems Bridget may be destined for terminal spinster-hood, two opposing forces enter her life - charming cad Daniel, and uptight (but very sexy) lawyer Mark.  Which of the two is her Mr. Right?  And why does everyone insist on asking that question detested by all singletons - ""How's your love life going?""  The movie's conclusion is predictable, and although any other ending would leave the audience feeling cheated, it does seem somewhat tame and ultimately unsatisfying.The film encourages the viewer both to get involved with Bridget emotionally and to laugh at her at the same time.  Perhaps the best joke is the milieu inhabited by her parents - where the mini-gherkin is the height of sophistication, and 60-year-olds throw garden parties with such alarming themes as 'tarts and vicars'.  Bridget is certainly no social butterfly, and whilst we cringe at her public embarrassments (notably her TV report involving a fireman's pole and a bottom the size of Brazil), we triumph with her when she manages to turn a bad situation to her advantage.  Maybe we can recognise a little bit of Bridget Jones in all of us."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,1999,6.5,"Two Jedi escape a hostile blockade to find allies and come across a young boy who may bring balance to the Force, but the long-dormant Sith resurface to claim their former glory.","Star Wars: Episode 1- The Phantom Menace is definitely worth a watch, but I do think it is one of the weaker movies of the Star Wars saga. I will admit I wasn't expecting much after reading some very negative reviews on IMDb, but I do think this particular instalment did in some ways exceed my expectations and disappointed as well. On a visual and technical level, it looks absolutely fantastic, with splendid special effects, stunning cinematography and fine scenery and costumes. The script is fairly decent, perhaps lacking the sophistication of Empire Strikes Back or New Hope, but does have some memorable lines. The action is constantly exhilarating, and Darth Maul, well played by Ray Park is a very good villain. Of course though, Darth Vader is better. Most of the performances are very good, especially Natalie Portman as Queen Padma who looked stunning and Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker who shone with his confident charm. And Jar Jar Binks is okay on the most part, and you have to love Yoda. And the music score by John Williams was outstanding, definitely one of his best works. The quality of sound and direction are also impressive. However, there were things about this film that did disappoint. One is despite the awesome visuals, strong music score and good characters, the story never quite distinguished itself. It did take a while to get going, and when it did try to get going and you could tell it wanted to, it was further disadvantaged by the uneven pacing. Liam Neeson is a fine actor, his performances in Kinsey and Schindler's List are proof of that, and I do like Ewan McGregor. But as Qui-Gon Jin and Obi Wan Kenobi, both stars give unusually wooden performances, and at times looked even embarrassed. And as I said, the pacing is very uneven, there are some slow moments, and one or two scenes felt rushed. All in all, maybe disappointing for fans of the saga, but it cannot be denied that visually it is an accomplishment. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
Sneeuwwitje en de zeven dwergen,1937,7.6,"Exiled into the dangerous forest by her wicked stepmother, a princess is rescued by seven dwarf miners who make her part of their household.","My mother kept an old clipping for years describing SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS when it opened at Radio City Music Hall and received a rave review from newspaper columnist Westbrook Pegler.He usually wrote about politics but on this occasion he took time to devote an entire review to Disney's new film. He called it a ""masterpiece"" and said that when the projectionist slipped those reels of film on the projector, the audience at the Music Hall witnessed one of the greatest motion pictures ever made.Coming from him, that was high praise indeed. And seeing the film now, restored for its video bow, we can appreciate his words. There are faults, to be sure, but basically it has to be admired for the innovative techniques it used in the art of animation. There are memorable sequences thanks to daring use of the multiplane camera: Snow White's flight through the woods, the Queen and her Magic Mirror, the Queen in the thunderous transformation scene as the camera seems to whirl around her, the Dwarfs in the mine and their march over the bridge as they sing ""Heigh-Ho"", the dwarfs chasing the witch in the thunderstorm. Even the rippling effects of the water in the wishing well scene.And, of course, there are the genuinely comic moments that made even the great Charlie Chaplin applaud in admiration. Dopey's antics are always a delight, as are Doc's and Grumpy's. All of the dwarfs are given inventive and funny things to do.The music is a standout: Someday My Prince Will Come, Heigh-Ho, I'm Wishing, The Yodel Song, etc. The young in heart will always love this classic. It belongs in the top tier of Disney's crown jewels, along with Pinocchio, Bambi, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella.Summing up: an inspired work of art on every level that will remain a timeless classic."
Stargate,1994,7.0,"An interstellar teleportation device, found in Egypt, leads to a planet with humans resembling ancient Egyptians who worship the god Ra.","When scientists and historians finally figure out the meaning of an ancient Egyptian artifact, it opens a portal to another planet.Stargate was panned by the critics on its release, no A list stars they cried, a plot line that bore a resemblance to a 1970 film called Erinnerungen an die Zukunft, and apparently caught between being an adult picture and a child friendly blockbuster. Those critics were forced to eat their words as Stargate promptly went on to be a monster smash, making $196,567,262 worldwide, and spawning a hugely popular TV series. It is for sure a no brain popcorn piece, suspension of disbelief should be at the forefront of any prospective first time viewer, but it's great fun and snazzy in all its set piece work.Led by square jawed Kurt Russell as an on the edge Colonel, our band of merry men adventurers face peril in their new world via the weather, language barriers with the locals, oh and something a touch more sinister!. James Spader does an impressive turn as a geeky Egyptologist, on who's fate the groups survival may well rest, while Jaye Davidson serves a reminder that yes, he did act in movies many years ago. It's clich√© ridden, and most of it is hacked together from far better pictures in the genres that Stargate wants to emulate, but it's damn entertaining and looks fabulous in High Definition. 7/10"
Aladdin and the King of Thieves,,6.3,"The King of Thieves disrupts Aladdin and Jasmine's long-anticipated wedding, looking for an oracle that will lead him to an even bigger treasure. His true identity causes trouble for Aladdin.","All of the recent Disney sequels have a set formula that makes them generally the same movie. The main characters have a kid, the kids a rebel, and gets into trouble. Not so with this one. It effectively combines the Aladdin story with the legend of Midas - a touch that turned everything to gold. Again we get to see Robin Williams in character as the blue genie, and funny as always. Again, its a movie meant for the kids, but everyone can find some value in it."
The Proposal,2009,6.8,"When New York editor Margaret faces deportation, she convinces her assistant Andrew to marry her in return for a promotion. However, when she visits his hometown, it changes her in many ways.","Even though it so clearly apes the set-up of David Frankel's ""The Devil Wears Prada"", I think the first 25 minutes of this 2009 romantic comedy has genuine snap enhanced by the sharp comedy interplay between stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Once the story leaves the Manhattan publishing house for the pastoral wilderness of Alaska, the story reverts into a formulaic sitcom bearing more than a passing resemblance to Bullock's break-out vehicle, 1995's ""While You Were Sleeping"", including an escalation of comic deceptions and a heart-tugging wedding confessional. Give credit to the fortyish actress/producer for not giving in too much to standard ing√©nue behavior this time. In fact, she plays the alpha dog with Reynolds relegated to the traditional leading lady role. The result produces enough contrived shenanigans to please Bullock's die-hard fans thanks to by-the-numbers work by director Anne Fletcher (""27 Dresses"") and first-time screenwriter Pete Chiarelli.The storyline has Bullock playing vituperative book editor Margaret Tate, a workaholic careerist who instills fear into her entire office. As her bullied assistant Andrew Paxton, Reynolds caters to her every whim in the hopes that she will help boost his publishing career. As is typical for an opposites-attract rom-com, a complication occurs when Margaret, a Canadian, finds out she is to be deported because her visa application has been denied. Instead of facing immediate termination, she manipulates Andrew to let her superiors know that they are getting married. This moment of desperate deceit leads to an awkward visit with an immigration agent who senses a green-card arrangement and requires proof of their relationship. In order to avert suspicion, Margaret accompanies Andrew to visit his close-knit family in Sitka, Alaska, where it is revealed his family is quite wealthy and in fact, run many of the businesses in town.They continue their charade of being engaged, which of course, fans the flames of his family's enthusiasm for a wedding. The rest of the film is pretty much you would expect save a strange episode of Andrew's grandmother performing a native dance in the woods. It's funny to see how Bullock cleverly uses the same prickliness she displayed effectively in her near-cameo in Paul Haggis' ""Crash"" in this film's establishing scenes as Margaret. In turn, Reynolds shows smart timing as put-upon Andrew, and their interplay has a nice edge. Note how well they perform during the best scenes early on when Margaret baldly lies about their upcoming nuptials at the office and in front of the immigration officer. It's just when they move into more traditional rom-com territory where their chemistry feels weakened and the sparks doused. Chiarelli's haphazard screenplay doesn't help them as they have little beyond one bedtime confessional scene to make us think they may belong together. Craig T. Nelson plays a familiar role as Andrew's disapproving father, but their subplot weighs down the proceedings unnecessarily.Except for one brief face-off with Nelson, Mary Steenburgen is wasted as Andrew's always-smiling mother. Betty White is a welcome sight as feisty Grandma Annie, although I wish the creators could have made her more like Sue Ann Nivens (""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"") and less like Rose Nylund (""The Golden Girls""). As the girl Andrew left behind in Sitka, Malin Akerman (""Watchmen"") is actually left stranded by the script, while Oscar Nu√±ez (""The Office"") grows increasingly tiresome as store clerk/male stripper Ramone. His absurd club performance, along with a nude run-in between the principals, just shows how little faith the creators had in the material to sustain the plot. Standard extras come with the 2009 DVD: a decent commentary track from Fletcher and Chiarelli (but sadly not the actors), seven minutes of outtakes, two deleted scenes of little interest, and an alternate ending which really just switches the locale versus the resolution."
The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh,1977,7.5,"In this collection of animated shorts based on the stories and characters by A.A. Milne, Winnie the Pooh, a honey-loving teddy bear, embarks on some eccentric adventures.","A small collection of Pooh's early adventures.I recently watched and introduced this to my toddler daughter and she absolutely loved it! I admit I enjoyed it more than I though I would too. I've seen it a couple times, and I surprisingly appreciate it more and more the older I get.This film truly captures the wonderment of being a child. But not in a happy-go-lucky kind of way - the characters all experience what appear to be legit challenges - but in a way that really embraces the thoughts, struggles, and ability to overcome that was present at one time in all of us.I think one would be hard pressed to find someone who truly did not like this film (they maybe just won't admit it)."
Pocahontas,1995,6.7,An English soldier and the daughter of an Algonquin chief share a romance when English colonists invade seventeenth century Virginia.,"I'll admit: This is not my top favorite Disney movie. Probably not in my top three. But this movie is still good.I'll also admit I don't usually choose to watch this movie. But when I do watch it, I see that this is an INCREDIBLE Disney movie with INCREDIBLE songs telling an INCREDIBLE story. I really do like this movie, even if it's not my favorite. And Pocahontas is SO pretty. And I love the hair movement in this movie. It really bugs me when cartoon hair barely moves whatsoever, but this movie's hair is more realistic. Plus it's entertaining while telling history that's (kind of) accurate. Thank you for reading my review."
Dumbo,1941,7.2,"Ridiculed because of his enormous ears, a young circus elephant is assisted by a mouse to achieve his full potential.","This is the quintessential Disney cartoon: brief, engaging, and profound ¬ñ storytelling at its finest. Where ""Snow White"" doesn't make the cut (begins with rapidly developing melodramatic plot, pauses for most of an hour to allow forest creatures and midgets to play cute, and wraps up quickly), ""Dumbo"" spins its wise lesson with elegant timing and charming characters. We all can use that magic feather once in a while."

The American President,1995,6.8,"A widowed U.S. President running for reelection and an environmental lobbyist fall in love. It's all above-board, but ""politics is perception,"" and sparks fly anyway.","The American President has more than just a whiff of conventionality and predictability in it, but it still remains interesting, enjoyable, and amusing thanks to a competently executed screenplay and excellent performances. The American President is excellent because it has a taut, very lean screenplay which disposes of any silliness of unnecessary scenes. As a result the film runs with excellent pace and their boredom never creeps in at all. My most common complaint with films like this, which marries its characters personal life's with their professional ones, is that often films becomes clunking handled, where the plot driving the necessary conflict in the romcom arises from matters related to their occupations rather than their personal lives. In fact that was my problem with Broadcast News, and it is to screenwriter Sorkins credit that this is not a problem here. Despite the president being supposedly a man with essentially no personal life, the screenplay is able to cleverly navigate this theme of delineating the two spheres. Whereas the central conflict of this film still arises from the leads' differences in their professional lives, their professional lives are interesting, intriguing, and well presented, and the resolution recognises such a delineation. This film also has wonderful performances from the two appealing leads. Michael Douglas, a splitting image of his father, the legend Kirk Douglas, is suave, witty, and charismatic. He shares good chemistry with Annette Bennings Sydney, who manages wonderfully her role- She is adorable and likeable though there is still no doubt Sydney is a strong willed, assertive, fully formed woman. Sorkins screenplay also has several profound insights on the difficulty of being commanded in chief, a scene about janitors and proportional response being a particularly memorable moment. All I can say is Sorkin is a master at writing, and his screenplay here is consistently excellent material. Overall, The American President is a very enjoyable, likable romcom that contains good insights about politics. It is a charming, competently managed film."
Sleepless in Seattle,1993,6.8,A recently widowed man's son calls a radio talk-show in an attempt to find his father a partner.,"Sleepless In Seattle is truly a film for the Nineties. It's a film that is in part based on the high tech culture that the Nineties spawned with computers and nationwide talk radio. How could have you done a film like this in another time?Well romance is certainly eternal and if the way humans connect is different now, the point is they still connect. And this film takes up the proposition that some folks are fated to be mated.If I had ever done this thing for either of my parents back in the day or something similar I shudder to think of the consequences. But when young Ross Malinger calls a radio psychologist played in voice only by Caroline Aaron about his father it sets off an entire chain of events that make you believe in fate.Tom Hanks is the recently widowed father of Malinger they've just finished burying his wife Carey Lowell and he thinks a change of scenery is in order to assuage his grief. Hanks and Malinger move to Seattle and its from their new home in Seattle that young Master Malinger makes his fateful call. Hanks gets on the phone as well and his story touches female hearts across America and he's known by the moniker of Sleepless In Seattle.One of those touched hearts is Meg Ryan's who is ready to marry Bill Pullman who is playing what used to be called the Ralph Bellamy role. Good old reliable steady Bill, but Meg is hearing a different calling and taking her cues from that Leo McCarey classic, An Affair To Remember she goes in a nationwide hunt for Hanks.More cynical folks than myself would say that Ryan was stalking Hanks and there are laws against it. But if one is fated to be mated than those laws just don't apply.Hanks and Ryan strike just the right note as the fated couple and Hanks has some great scenes with young Malenger. Rosie O'Donnell has a nice bit in this as well as Ryan's equally romantic minded friend who kind of quarterbacks Ryan's moves.Sleepless In Seattle got two Oscar nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Song. Nora Ephron directed her own screenplay and the result is a magic romantic film like they used to do even in the high tech Nineties."
"Definitely, Maybe",2008,7.1,A political consultant tries to explain his impending divorce and past relationships to his 11-year-old daughter.,"I just saw this movie today and I loved it. I was the only teenage guy in the theatre also. The movie had a great message to it about always being happy. The little girl in this movie was also great she brought a lot to this movie, with out her this would not have been a good movie. The acting was good and the direction was especially good as well. I saw this with my dad today and it brought tears to his eyes. So this movie was also a tear jerker. For someone that loves romantic comedy movies I think would love this movie. It was a little slow moving but I kind of expected it to be. After it got near the end of the movie though it really got you thinking and wishing for him to end up with the girl he was meant to be with. It kind of also took little twists which were good as well. Ryan Reynolds did a terrific job in this movie playing a father who is going through a divorce. Then his daughter tries to help him find his true love. This movie was everything I hoped for so I think that you should definitely take someone to see this movie and have a great time."
K-9,1989,6.1,"To stop an elusive criminal, a maverick detective enlists the aid of a police dog who's an unusually intelligent smart alec.","James Belushi is the cop, Dewley, who seems to have spent most of his time chasing after the same guy, the drug lord Lyman played Kevin Tighe. And is then finally forced to get a partner in the shape of Jerry Lee the German Shepard dog. They have a very comedic relationship quite like that of Turner and Hooch.Things take a dangerous turn for Dewley and Jerry Lee when Dewley's girlfriend Tracey, played by Mel Harris, is taken hostage by Lyman.

Madagascar,2005,6.9,"A group of animals who have spent all their life in a New York zoo end up in the jungles of Madagascar, and must adjust to living in the wild.","Lots of fun - I saw it with the grandkids and a theater full of families. a great time was had by all. technically speaking, one might say that the story was 'uneven' in places (can you say *that* about animated films? (-:) -- I mention this because there has been some needlessly negative feedback here at IMDb. On the whole, though, the presentation is quick-paced, bright, happy, and delightful to the eyes and ears. There are also some unique, quirky scenes (i.e. animals nonchalantly getting on a subway?) - I love to see stuff I haven't seen before. that's not easy to do, you know - by all accounts, ""everything has been done on film already.."" - (if you catch my drift). so, give credit when due! enjoy!(-:"
Gnomeo & Juliet,2011,5.9,"Separated by a garden fence and a feud, are blue gnomes on one side and red gnomes on the other. This doesn't stop blue Gnomeo and red Juliet from falling in love with each other. Do they have a future together?","No other writer lends himself to so many different film interpretations as William Shakespeare, whose plays have spawned musicals (West Side Story), teen comedies (10 Things I Hate About You), even cartoons (though not credited as such, Hamlet is an obvious source of inspiration for The Lion King). The latter genre is used again for a peculiar take on Romeo and Juliet, put together with CGI under Disney's Touchstone banner.The film takes place in the present day, where Montague and Capulet no longer are two warring families, but simply two next-door neighbors who just don't get along. This animosity is also found in their adjacent gardens, where the gnomes, much like the toys in Toy Story, come to life when no one's watching. The blue gnomes, led by Lady Blueberry (Maggie Smith), belong to Mrs. Montague, while Lord Redbrick (Michael Caine) and his red acolytes belong to Mr. Capulet. Their mission is to find new ways to make the enemy garden look bad, and it all goes well - so to speak - until a full-scale war erupts, and star-crossed lovers Gnomeo (James McAvoy) and Juliet (Emily Blunt) find themselves caught in the middle...The material is an unusual choice for Disney, which traditionally favors straightforward adaptations of popular stories (albeit with necessary alterations) over postmodern riffs that combine tribute and spoof. This take on Shakespeare's tragedy would probably be better suited for a Dreamworks treatment, as they make no mystery of having older audiences in mind. Disney, on the other hand, is torn between pandering to younger viewers and giving Bard aficionados the fun yet intelligent picture they crave and deserve. Sure, there are in-jokes galore (the house numbers 2B and Not 2B are the standout), but the third act is particularly underwhelming, with too much screen-time for the mandatory talking animal sidekick (an annoying flamingo, voiced by Disney mainstay Jim Cummings) and a climax that has inevitably been altered - presumably - to keep the kids from crying.When it works, however, Gnomeo & Juliet is an absolute joy: the opening send-up of the play's prologue set the tone quite nicely, Elton John's contribution to the soundtrack is faultless, and the voice cast is a hoot. Aside from the filmmakers having the nerve of putting Jason Statham and Ozzy Osbourne in the same film as Smith and Caine (surely a once in a lifetime kind of thing), the idea of incorporating Shakespeare himself as a character (voiced by Patrick Stewart) and having him criticize the film's plot detours is the self-mocking stroke of genius there should be more of throughout the movie.All in all, this is a nice little film that is worth watching for entertainment value. It suffers from some lazy writing and questionable gags (shouldn't the Terrafirminator be voiced by Arnold Schwarzenegger instead of Hulk Hogan?), but it contains enough Shakespearean wit and invention to make for a fun 82 minutes."
Taxi,1998,7.0,"To work off his tarnished driving record, a hip taxi driver must chauffeur a loser police inspector on the trail of German bank robbers.","This is a very Gallic film indeed, but as a fan of French cinema - and of the French in general - I have to say that I enjoyed this film very much indeed. The plot is, I admit, weak in places. That doesn't matter though - this film isn't about cerebral entertainment, it's about car chases and jokes, and humour is something the French do very well. The car chases are spectacular - and far better, for my money, than the car chases featured in Gone in 60 Seconds, The Matrix Reloaded or The Fast and the Furious. Hollywood could do a lot worse than look over the Atlantic to see how car movies are made. Unfortunately, it now seems that they have but I didn't mean that they should copy the French, they need original ideas, but they also need to imitate the French flair. The jokes come thick and fast, and had me howling with laughter - it takes a lot of humour for me to forgive an absence of plot - this film has it in spades. So there you have it. Ignore the American rip off. Watch the original. You won't regret it."
Over the Hedge,2006,6.7,"A scheming raccoon fools a mismatched family of forest creatures into helping him repay a debt of food, by invading the new suburban sprawl that popped up while they were hibernating...and learns a lesson about family himself.","Wow! Wow! Wow! I was transfixed! The animation? Gorgeous! The subtle humor? Uproarious! The not-so-subtle humor? Even better! This was a great movie that will surely be nominated for an Oscar if for no other reason than the beauty of the animation. While I could have honestly thought of a couple of better casting choices, I will mention that Wanda Sykes, Thomas Haden Church and Steve Carrell were brilliant in their roles. And who better to make fun of William Shatner than William Shatner? Worthy of special mention (and a second look - go see this movie again!): the Rottweiler interludes, the ripples in the water, the porcupine quills, the oh-so-amazing foliage throughout the movie, and Vincent's cartoonish-yet-strangely-scary expression.Really REALLY a great movie that should appeal to all.Enjoy."
Dear John,2010,6.3,A romantic drama about a soldier who falls for a conservative college student while he's home on leave.,"Lasse Hallstr√∂m, the Swedish director who gave us Chocolat (2001), Gilbert Grape (1993) and Hachi: A Dog's Tale (2009) is at it again - making chick flicks for guys. This means, unlike your stereotypical chick flick whose leading man is a hollow beefcakey stud with as much personality as the scenery, here we get a complex beefcakey stud whom the chicks can swoon over whilst the bros say ""duuuuude he's cool.""In this case the protagonist is ""John"" (Channing Tatum) who plays an Army Special Forces character who can kill you with a toothpick but has total control over his emotions. Until, of couse, he meets ""Savannah"" (Amanda Seyfried) over his 2 week furlough before going back to war.As you might guess, the story explores the ultimate long distance relationship as John completes his 1 year tour as a soldier while Savannah waits at home. Sounds boring? Well wait, there are complications. John's father is autistic and his mother abandoned them years ago. So John is forced to be the responsible one, but the whole war/love thing throws him out of whack.Meanwhile Savannah has a few secrets of her own (and I gotta admit I totally didn't see it coming). And on top if it all, 9/11 hits and this forces John to make a decision whether to stay with his platoon and most likely get his butt blown off, or retire once his initial tour is over. Oh, and the movie begins with John getting blasted by gunfire, meaning the story unfolds in a huge flashback leaving us wondering the whole time if John dies or not.This is a very sentimental flick, much like the other Hallstr√∂m movies I mentioned, but it doesn't get sappy or predictable. In fact at least 3 plot twists took me by total surprise. And I'm talking like ""whoa duuuuude I never saw THAT coming"" surprise.""Dear John"" focuses on interpersonal relationships when duty comes into play - and I'm not just talking about duty toward your country (a cleverly woven parallel), but duty to parents, children and those who need help. This is juxtaposed against selfish happiness, or the storybook love. Pay close attention to the characters' choices & sacrifices, and how these choices are based on duty/selflessness rather than ""getting the girl"". I think that's what makes this a unique romance. Whereas most Hollywood romance flicks focus on the problems of 2 lovers, ""Dear John"" presents us with an ideal love that is complicated by external loyalties.The trademark of Hallstr√∂m movies is some other issue (not just love) driving the characters, and that's why these films aren't sappy or predictable. Another trademark is is use of gorgeous scenery, in this case the beaches of Charleston SC. He achieves a very nostalgic beach feeling, even for those of us who have only been to the beach once or twice in our lives (see also his film ""Safe Haven"" filmed in Southport, NC).""Dear John"" is a quiet, sentimental film, so don't expect action, car chases & robots. But it delivers a few tricky plot twists, so it's never boring. If you're not familiar with Hallstr√∂m's style, I'd say it's artistic without being over-the-top artsy. Think of Kieslowsky (Blue, White, Red trilogy) or Wim Wenders (Paris Texas, Wings of Desire) or possibly even Steven Soderbergh (Sex Lies & Videotape, Solaris, Magic Mike) and you'll have a general idea of how this film feels."
Perfume: The Story of a Murderer,2006,7.5,"Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, born with a superior olfactory sense, creates the world's finest perfume. His work, however, takes a dark turn as he searches for the ultimate scent.","With ""The Perfume"" it's like with any blockbuster movie: if the critics praise it, it's horrible - if the critics hate it, it's brilliant.I had the chance to watch a preview of ""The Perfume"" tonight and I was very surprised: this movie is really good! Okay, it can't actually make you smell all the scents and odours, but the images and the music allow you to experience the atmosphere and the emotions Grenouille is feeling when he takes in the scents of his environment. You couldn't have done this much better without the use of real scents at theatres.Although much of the story is told by a narrative voice (mostly quotes from the novel), the movie is still thrilling and exciting all the way. It's a very good adaption of S√ºskind's novel, sticking to the original plot concerning the major events, leaving away unnecessary subplots (although it's a pity that funny ""lethal gas""-plot was cut out!) and shortening long passages. The result is well-constructed movie that is worth seeing.The actors, especially Whishaw who plays Grenouille, have done a very good job. Like in the novel, Grenouille is an ambivalent character and you never know whether to love him for his genius talent or to hate him for his cruel murders. Whishaw's half-crazy, scary gaze made me shiver. Dustin Hoffman as old and unsuccessful parfumeur Baldini was very convincing... I loved the way he talks to Grenouille arrogantly although he recognizes how much more talent the young man has. Baldini is always good for a laugh.The only thing to criticize is that the movie is not as brutal as the novel. I think they wanted to avoid the FSK 16 rating and so didn't show much violence, which in my opinion would have been necessary if you wanted the movie to have the same shocking impact on the audience as the novel. For example I was really shocked by the end of the novel - in the movie you hardly see what happens.However, it's really a thrilling story visualized excellently - go to the movies and watch ""The Perfume""! You won't be disappointed."
Psycho,1998,4.6,"In Gus Van Sant's remake of Alfred Hitchcock's classic, young female bank employee Marion Crane steals money from her boss in Phoenix, flees town, and arrives at Fairvale, California's rundown Bates Motel, which has secrets of its own.","19 years after the original shock of seeing one of the great Hitchcock classics massacred by one of the greatest living directors, I sat to watch it again. Surprise, surprise. Gus Van Sant's daring attempt could have been another masterpiece if the casting of Norman Bates, in particular, had been more visionary and less opportunistic. Imagine what a break for an actor to re-invent that iconic character. Imagine what Heath Ledger, Billy Crudup, Ryan Gosling or Guy Pearce could have done with it. I'm sure that if you had been riveted rather than embarrassed by that characterization, if Vince Vaughn was more of a serious actor who understood the responsibility of his endeavor Van Sant's Psycho would have been a triumph."
Horrible Bosses,2011,6.9,Three friends conspire to murder their awful bosses when they realize they are standing in the way of their happiness.,"Me and my wife are big fans of movies. We like all kinds of them - old, new, American, European, sci-fi, documentary, drama, comedy etc.. I could count on my hands how many movies we left in the middle. And this is one of them. We were shocked how flat and dumb can things here be - beginning with terrible jokes and ending with stupid overacting. Such a surprise to see so many respected actors, Kevin Spacey being one of them, in this set. If a movie for you is like a background of pictures and noise along with many friends talking and eating around, maybe you might enjoy some parts of it, like teasing scenes of Aniston, but if you love movies, have at least a moderately developed sense of humor, forget about this crap..."
Contagion,2011,6.8,"Healthcare professionals, government officials and everyday people find themselves in the midst of a pandemic as the CDC works to find a cure.","People wanted a thrill. People wanted action. People wanted character development. Those elements weren't the intent, however. I'd have to admit expecting an action from the marketing materials and the poster, but I don't judge movies over a preconceived notion or genre. Without throwing out spoilers, I was happy to see that it's more of an ensemble cast than a Matt Damon flick, considering his small role. Yeah, he's Gwyneth's husband, but so what? It was a good analysis on how our country, and the world at large, would react to a real medical epidemic. We saw a few overblown pandemics the last few years with H1N1 and swine flu, and I believe this movie is a what-if thought experiment on steroids. They even paid homage to the real world examples near the conclusion. Granted, the real world issues turned out to be media overhype more than a real medical scare and I believe the movie covered the media in a brilliant way. I liked this movie because it was a societal study rather than just an updated 'Outbreak.' Regarding character development, there really wasn't a place for it in this movie. The only thing that touches it was the budding relationship between the two youngsters. On the other hand, I could, just as easily, write that off as a symbol of human strength, desire, and endurance since it survived the epidemic from beginning to the end. Favorite actor for the movie: Jude Law. He really sunk his teeth into his role and I really wanted to hate him. Great job."
A Few Best Men,2011,5.7,A groom and his three best men travel to the Australian outback for a wedding.,"You meet the girl of your dreams, and with the feeling being mutual, decide to fast track the romance into marriage. It's one of the big decisions in life, and so you engage some help from your pals, who happen to be some of the most disorganized bunch ever, unintentionally lining up what would be one of life's most memorable events with a series of mishaps and accidents that are just waiting to happen, from run ins with drug dealers, abuse of drugs and drink, and an animal featured somewhere as well. No this is not The Hangover films, although at first glance A Few Best Men may seem to tread on similar territory.Unlike the American films that focus on extreme shenanigans, A Few Best Men may deal with similar wedding blues in comedic fashion, but was rather a bit more restrained in its grossness, although toilet humour is something staple that is never too far away and utilized when there's a need to for maximum effect. This Australian production follows a more British route with witty repartee, and quirky, zany characters peppering the landscape, with probably the only sane people in the entire film being the groom David (Xavier Samuel) and his bride Mia (Laura Brent).The titular characters refer to David's best mates Tom (Kris Marshall) who's usually the catalyst of problems with his indifferent attitude, Graham (Kevin Bishop) the somewhat dim witted follower, and Luke (Tim Draxi) who still can't get over the break up with his ex. Together they lend support to David as his best men for his wedding, making that round the world trip from England to Australia. Mia on the other hand comes from a political family, with a senator for a dad in Jim (Jonathan Biggins) whose more than proud to turn his daughter's wedding into political gain, wife Barbara (Olivia Newton-John, probably the largest name in this ensemble), and sister Daphne (Rebel Wilson last seen in What To Expect When You're Expecting). With worlds so different colliding together, sparks fly in similar, slowly but surely fashion to Meet the Fockers, with a scene being somewhat of a lift off The Hangover when the stag's night out turned into one big blur.A Few Best Men sees the long awaited return by director Stephan Elliott, who did the acclaimed Priscilla Queen of the Desert. And I have to admit unabashedly that I'm somewhat of a fan of writer Dean Craig's work, after what he did with Death at a Funeral, dealing with something similar with family and friends' shenanigans standing out during life's ceremonies, and in a way this film seemed like a spiritual companion to his earlier work for the way it encompassed rip tickling moments over one of life's major rituals. It's basically Murphy's Law put on display here, with everything that can go wrong actually do go wrong, with a couple of surprise (some may argue convenient) twists thrown in for good measure.The soundtrack is also noteworthy in the film, consisting of mostly evergreens and oldies from the 60s and 70s, and having Olivia Newton-John lend her vocals as well. In fact, her character becomes what would be the live wire of the film as it wore on, together with Kris Marshall and Kevin Bishop drawing the loudest of laughs thanks to their subplot involving their quest for weed from which everything got intricately tied to no thanks to their being stuck with contraband drugs, and being quite inept in helping the groom settle and solve the mess they got everyone into.If one is game for ensemble films and buddy type ones where the inevitably lessons extracted will be themes on brotherhood, friendship and family, with lots of laughs thrown in from good measure, then A Few Best Men would be your choice this week during the summer season breather in between blockbusters hitting the cinemas. Highly recommended!"
The Matrix Revolutions,2003,6.7,The human city of Zion defends itself against the massive invasion of the machines as Neo fights to end the war at another front while also opposing the rogue Agent Smith.,"As the city of Zion fortifies itself for defence against the influx of sentinels, the two remaining ships of the fleet prepare to return to the city.  Neo lies in a coma with the sole survivor of the attack on the fleet, however his brain patterns show that he is lost somewhere within the matrix. Trinty and Morpheus go to rescue him and return him to the real world. Back in the real world, Zion is under attack from the sentinels, Neo decides that he must travel into the machine city and confront the creator of the matrix while Niobe pilots the remaining ship back to Zion to take on the sentinels.I love the original Matrix, but can't help feel that the 2 overblown, over serious sequels have damaged it.  This film works a little better than the second sequel but not by much.  Where Reloaded left us with unanswered questions, Revolutions offers us the answers.  Sadly the ""answers"" just left me confused and bewildered.  I didn't feel like the film even tried to explain what was going on, and the ending came about far too suddenly and with little explanation.  I know that a film is good if it leaves you thinking about things and I could sort of guess that Neo might have become some sort of programme etc at the end, but I still felt that the film should have helped me out even a little bit!The plot is very heavy going and it lacks the light imagination evident in the first film.  This really sucks the fun out of the film and makes it hard work - I have nothing against it being thought provoking and requiring thought, but it all seemed very laboured to me.  The opening hour is quite hard work and the whole ""train station"" thing is never really explained and just seems designed to fill time or something.  The action all looks great - the attack on Zion is visually very impressive and is quite exciting. However some fight scenes are so overblown that they failed to inspire.  The shootout in the check room of the club is simply a tired retread of the groundbreaking lobby shootout but it is the final fight with Smith that shows what I mean.  Neo's showdown with Smith in the first film was great fun and very exciting.  Here (and in Reloaded) it is an excess of special effects, horribly overblown - visually impressive but not enjoyable.The film seems to have taken on the mantel of ""meaningful epic"" where once it was a clever film with no assumptions.  Listen to the music - that's where the clue is.  Instead of the rock mix from the first film it has taken on big sweeping classical pieces that it scatters around liberally to try and give the film an epic feel that it doesn't deserve.  It is still worth seeing as it finishes the trilogy but it is hard work at times.  The acting continues the curse of Reloaded in that everyone thinks they are reading Shakespeare and gives their performance as if they were speaking words direct from God.  Even Weaving's Smith is a little too full of himself this time.  The dialogue is pretty bad as before - full of clich√©s and over wordy speeches of grandeur, it just gets tiresome before it gets engaging.In the first film we were told no one can be told what the matrix is, we must see it for ourselves.  We were then taken on a journey (with Neo), led by Morpheus into this world that was explained as we went.  Here we are simply dumped in the middle of an impenetrable plot and basically left to work things out for ourselves with little or no help.  Attempts to have characters like the Architect or the Oracle explain things are simply clunky and don't work at all. I'm not adverse to thinking, but the more I think about the film as a series the more i see unanswered holes.  I was hoping that Revolutions would tie things up from Reloaded and actually serve to make part 2 work better, but it didn't.  It took some positive steps but really the same weaknesses just continue.Overall I was glad I saw it to finish the story, and visually it had some very impressive moments.  However the feeling was of a film with no controls, spiralling out of control - with narrative flow lost behind half ideas and spiritual nonsense.  It is over indulgent, bloated and full of a sense of it's own importance - an importance it simply does not have and should not be wearing on it's sleeve.  The Wachowski's created a fascinating universe but, as they opened it out, their egos have inflated the material and their inability to control and tell such a massive story has shown and the last 2 films have really suffered as a result.  Worth watching for what it attempts to do, but ultimately very frustrating for what it actually delivers and, more importantly, what it fails totally to do."
Superbad,2007,7.6,Two co-dependent high school seniors are forced to deal with separation anxiety after their plan to stage a booze-soaked party goes awry.,"Maybe back then you couldn't tell what would become of Jonah Hill eventually (an Oscar nominated actor, playing with/against Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio) ... actually if you told anyone back then this would happen, they'd have written that in the script, because it would have sounded hilarious.Speaking of hilarious: That's something that can be said about this movie. Of course many will start comparing this with American Pie, Porkys and what not. But the movie stands on its own two feet and has been copied a lot itself. Never to that success and never as good as ""Superbad"" obviously. If you like your teen comedies to be raunchy and dirty, this is exactly your cup of tea. After watching this, you might also be McLovin (this) ... no relation to any Fast Food chain by the way ..."
The Time Machine,2002,6.0,"Hoping to alter the events of the past, a 19th century inventor instead travels 800,000 years into the future, where he finds humankind divided into two warring races.","I first watchd this flm with my parents who, when rewatching it with me, felt so nostalgic. I didn't get that feeling obviously being younger, however I can tell how magical this film would have been to them previously because I felt it even now.I really liked this film. I thought the great storyline of time travel and the sets I thought were amazing. The time machine itself as a prop and his I think its like a study or an office I thought was gorgeous in the way it looked.Brilliant acting I thought from everyone, intersesting concepts and just overall a very enjoyable film to watch.I strongly reccomend!"
Old School,2003,7.0,Three friends attempt to recapture their glory days by opening up a fraternity near their alma mater.,"Much like the tradition of the raunchy flicks of the 80s, Old School encompasses the age old tradition of tactless and tasteless film creation. Buy the oddity of the situation, this is one of those films I can tolerate. Mid-life malaise couldn't have been drawn better in the lives of Mitch, Frank and Beanie. Men who serve no purpose in society, especially to their significant others. But that's the significance of the frat house. No, it isn't about being drunk and hitting on 19-year-old girls, its about reaffirming your role in society and making the inner soul feel good and relaxed. So, say what you want about the random nudity and cussing, this film is a life affirming film for all men hitting their 30s."
"Me, Myself",2000,6.6,A nice-guy cop with Dissociative Identity Disorder must protect a woman on the run from a corrupt ex-boyfriend and his associates.,"There is probably no other movie coming out this summer that will produce more from the gut laughs than Me, Myself & Irene.  Sure it's crude, sure it's vulgar and juvenile at times, but sometimes we just have to take ourselves back to when we were younger and used to laugh at things that we would otherwise find rather disgusting.  The main treat is to watch Carrey transform from the sweet natured Charlie to the vulgar, Dirty Harry sounding Hank.  Hank does things that not many people would even dream of, and it's a kick to see him get away with some of them.  Equally funny are Charlie's three sons, who are highly intelligent, love their dad and use a certain phrase to great effect.  Some may find this movie offensive and occasionally funny at times, but I found it enjoyable from beginning to end.   A good way to blow off steam from a bad day."
√Üon Flux,2005,5.4,"√Üon Flux is a mysterious assassin working for the Monicans, a group of rebels trying to overthrow the government. When she is sent on a mission to kill the Chairman, a whole new mystery is found.","We just got home from seeing Aeon Flux, and for my money, it turned out to be far better than I had expected. Ready for an action movie with lots of leaping, jumping and hero stuff, it was all of that - but more. It actually had a story line! And it was that story line that kept things moving nicely along.I think that it's relatively short length (97 minutes) also helped it from being bogged down with minutiae and having a plot that had to be mercilessly stretched beyond its limits. The scenes were crisply photographed, the special effects were enough to give the film its character WITHOUT making it a special-effects movie, per se.Although a little thin in some parts, the dialogue was fair. The only thing I thought might have made it better was the development of some of the peripheral characters.Charlize Theron is very versatile, and now I fully intend to see the anime of Aeon Flux."
Anger Management,2003,6.3,"Dave Buznik is a businessman who is wrongly sentenced to an anger management program, where he meets an aggressive instructor.","This is a pretty good romantic comedy with silly bits tossed in (like the squeaky toy bear). This is the first Sandler performance I've really liked a lot, and while Nicholson is really just tossing it off, let's face it, his throwaways are frequently better than the best from most other actors. Here the match - Sandler at his most restrained, Nicholson getting sloppy - works very well, as each becomes a complement to the other, which is wholly in keeping with the characters and their situation. The supporting cast is also doing very well. And the film is well-made: possibly even too much so, as for instance with the cinematography, which is of a high quality that would suit a heavy dramatic film.There are definitely some laugh-out-loud high moments along the way, and very few low moments. Not a great movie, but definitely a movie you can spend an evening with and think it money well-spent."
Jack the Giant Slayer,2013,6.3,"The ancient war between humans and a race of giants is reignited when Jack, a young farmhand fighting for a kingdom and the love of a princess, opens a gateway between the two worlds.",Jack the Giant Slayer is a hit and miss for the majority of this film it provides all the classic clich√©s and parts that we would see in a well known children's fairytale and it provides a fair bit of the usual good special effects and action sequences but outside that there isn't that much good about it
Dredd,2012,7.1,"In a violent, futuristic metropolis, a law enforcement and his rookie trainee become caught up in a high-stakes drug war.","Graphic, gripping, and very well developed. This is exactly what we should see from a comic of this subject matter. The performances are outstanding; everyone plays their role to absolute perfection. Completely loaded with entertaining action and blood to keep you interested. The directing, editing, sound design, and effects, terrific. A criminally underrated movie that I'm glad got the cult following and recognition it deserves."
Friends with Benefits,2011,6.5,"A young man and woman decide to take their friendship to the next level without becoming a couple, but soon discover that adding sex only leads to complications.",Funny with a twist of relatability and drama.Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunos come to the table with a stellar performance for this cliche and comical movie.Great job cast and crew.
Nowhere Boy,2009,7.1,"A chronicle of John Lennon's first years, focused mainly in his adolescence and his relationship with his stern aunt Mimi, who raised him, and his absentee mother Julia, who re-entered his life at a crucial moment in his young life.","I guess this would be considered an ""a moment-in-the-life-of-biopic"" as it focuses on only a couple of years of pre-Beatles John Lennon's life in Liverpool, England (and not his entire life). It is an interesting story and one I did not know. It asks and answers the question: Where did Lennon get his start and love for music?The film's subject matter -- the early life of John Lennon -- made Nowhere Boy an interesting story and sell for me; and since the acting in the movie happened to be stellar -- it was a bonus. Aaron Johnson (Kick-Ass) does a decent job as the 15-year-old Lennon and proves to be one to watch as he's going to have a long career although the real acting ""glory"" of the film belongs to the two lead females who are left to battle it out as Lennon's motherly figure(s). Kristin Scott Thomas (Four Weddings and a Funeral, The English Patient) plays his aunt who has raised John from early infant-hood as her sister was considered to be an unlikely parent/guardian. In the film, John stumbles upon his birth mother out of curiosity and becomes intrigued with her demeanor. Actress Anne-Marie Duff (Notes on a Scandal, The Last Station) is rather revelatory here (BOTH her and Scott Thomas deservingly earned 2010 BAFTA nominations for these very roles).The story is sentimental and tragic and it is tied together quite nicely by the three lead players who all play off of each other very well and convincingly (Duff is flighty, Scott Thomas is concerned and Johnson is a free soul). The young Lennon becomes a mixture of the two women (a poetic rebel) and their influences are highly evident in the film and his later music.Any Beatles fan should check this one out. It isn't full of Hey Jude's and Elinor Rigby's but this is Pre-Beatles (we do meet a young Paul) so we get a taste of the kid before he become our ""Nowhere Boy""."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,2013,6.1,Brother/sister duo Hansel and Gretel are professional witch-hunters who help innocent villagers. One day they stumble upon a case that could hold the key to their past.,"Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters (2013)** (out of 4)R-rated, gory horror-adventure has brother and sisters Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretal (Gemma Arterton) called to a small town to try and locate some children that have been kidnapped by some witches. Soon they realize that a Queen witch (Famke Janssen) has bigger plans that could have a major change on the world. HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS isn't quite as bad as some are making it out to be but there's no question that the entire film just has an uneasy mix of genres that never fully come together and in the end the film just came off as something that didn't know what it wanted to be or do. At times there's some campy comedy moments but these aren't good enough to save the picture. At other times we're given a fairly interesting look at two people hunting witches but the film doesn't do too much with this. We're also given a picture with some extremely graphic gore that comes out of nowhere. I really liked the fact that they went for a R-rating and didn't hold back for a smaller rating but at the same time if you took this away there really wouldn't be much to the movie. The film manages to be slightly entertaining because of this type of gore but at the same time I can see how it might not sit well with some more sensitive viewers. Another thing I liked was the actual look of the witches. The CGI effects were actually quite believable whenever the witches changed form in their faces. The look of the major witch was also quite nice and benefited from the strong and fun performance by Janssen who managed to bring a certain sexy nature to the role. Both Renner and Arterton are good in their parts but the screenplay really makes both characters quite boring and uninteresting. The supporting players here are usually much better and the movie probably would have benefited having them in it more. This includes an obsessed fan of the duo as well as an evil sheriff. Another problem with the film is that you just never really get involved with anything going on. It looks nice and some of the action scenes are put together nicely but there's just no real energy that brings you into the film."
The West Wing,,8.9,Inside the lives of staffers in the West Wing of the White House.,"Reviewers say 'The West Wing' is lauded for its intelligent dialogue, strong ensemble cast, and realistic depiction of political processes. It explores governance complexities, moral dilemmas, and political figures' personal struggles. However, criticisms include fast-paced dialogue, perceived liberal bias, and handling of political issues. Some find its idealism and political portrayal unrealistic, while others appreciate its engaging storytelling and character development."
Side Effects,2013,7.1,A young woman's world unravels when a drug prescribed by her psychiatrist has unexpected side effects.,"In our pharmaceutically inclined society, side effects are ever-present hazards of prescription drug usage. Whether they are minimized in print, or spoken in a hushed tone at the close of television commercials, side effects have become a shady companion of prescription drugs. Side Effects, Steven Soderbergh's alleged final film, focuses on the consequences visited upon a young couple after the side effects from the wife's medication cause her to commit an alarming act. As the chasm opens beneath this young woman, her psychiatrist struggles with his responsibility for her predicament, and confront his lingering suspicion about his patient's state of mind.Ever the auteur, Soderbergh remains delightfully unpredictable with this latest feature. Side Effects initially presents itself as an indictment of the pharmaceutical industry, wearing its heavy-handed message on its sleeve, but promptly converts into a psychological suspense thriller. Soderbergh stares you directly in the eyes while he rips the rug from beneath your feet, sending you spiraling toward a conclusion that is equally unexpected and pleasing. Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns (Contagion, The Bourne Ultimatum) channel Hitchcock, creating an in-depth narrative that remains unpredictable until its final scene.Soderbergh is known for generating a positive film environment for his cast, and maximizing the actors' potential in his films. Although the cast for Side Effects is comprised of actors who have previously provided impressive performances, each actor presents a character that rivals any prior roles. Rooney Mara plays the young woman at the epicenter of the conflict. Mara is extremely engrossing, creating an aura of discontent and depression within her situation. She acts as the film's catalyst, holding all the characters together while prompting them toward their conclusions. Attractive, graceful, and erratic, Mara is the wounded girl who isn't all that she seems.While the film's driving force is Mara, Jude Law is its principle focus. As Mara's overwhelmed psychiatrist, Law provides his most empathetic role to date. Law establishes a flawed character who struggles with the consequences forced upon him, and transforms into a protagonist worthy of our admiration. Law and Mara provide such intriguing characterizations, Soderbergh seems to have difficulty deciding which to devote more time to. The scenes they share are the most arresting in this film.There are few things more satisfying than a film which receives little attention, but creates an unexpectedly entertaining experience. Though Soderbergh has billed Side Effects as his swan song, he confirms that he is a cinematic mastermind in a film that would be an impressive conclusion to an eccentric career. Indulge in this unconventional thriller; you won't mind the side effects.flickermotion.blogspot.com/"
Dinner for Schmucks,2010,5.9,"After he finds out that his work superiors host a dinner celebrating the idiocy of their special guests, a rising executive questions the merits of his invitation just as he befriends a man who would be the perfect guest.","""Dinner for Schmucks"" has a clever title but it needed to spend more time on the main course. The audience is subjugated to almost one and a half hours of build up time before the dinner bell rings. It's not time wasted though, the story does make good use of its two hour run time. However, I felt like I was on a plane taxiing down the runway trying to get up enough speed to take off and once in flight the plane kept dipping and then pulling back up; then it finally it made an abrupt landing and the flight was over.We are first introduced to Tim (played by Paul Rudd), an investment analyst, who is presented an opportunity to pounce on a new promotion at work. The story is set up as most business tales are told. The boss has an important client, the main character is presented with a once in a life time opportunity to prove his worth and so on and so forth. While in the process he learns something about himself.The business men (one of whom is played by Ron Livingston from ""Office Space"" fame) are the typical jerks who will do anything to keep on top of the dog pile. In this particular dog pile they also like to pick on the smaller, weaker dogs. It just so happens that the big dogs are having their ""dinner for winners"" in a few days. Tim now has a great chance to prove to his boss he will go to any length to earn the new position. The catch is that he has to find a loser to bring to dinner. They then have a contest, unbeknown to the losers, to see who the biggest schmuck is.Tim finds his loser immediately the next day not by chance but because as Tim so wisely says ""everything happens for a reason"". Welcome aboard, Barry (played by Steve Carell), here the story starts picking up a little steam. Barry has a unique talent of finding the positive in almost any situation, he mispronounces words that any 5th grader knows, works for the IRS and in his spare time works on his ""Mouseterpieces"". A perfect fit for Tim. A ""Mouseterpiece"" is Barry's taxidermy side projects where he takes dead mice and mounts them in familiar historical and everyday scenarios (i.e. The Last Supper, mice having a picnic, Whistler's Mother, etc).A lot of activity happens in that single night before the big dinner; Tim and Barry break into one of Tim's girlfriend's biggest clients' homes and finds him in a weird sexual perversion act. Next Barry accidentally invites Tim's ex-fling, Darla, over to the apartment and the first laugh riot is finally given to the audiences through a funny fight scene between Barry and Darla. Then it is on to the IRS to talk to Barry's boss, Therman (played by Zach Galifianakis), who is also a self proclaimed mind reader. Have you noticed they still haven't made it to the dinner yet? The next day Tim has a brunch appointment with a potential multi million dollar client where Barry and Darla show up trying to smooth things over. Again the straight man, Tim, and goofy man, Barry, routine starts up and we are given another good laugh. It was a pretty easy set up; take a high pressure situation and place it in any restaurant that has a Maitre d' next mix in a socially inept character such as Barry and something funny is bound to happen.After all of this we are finally taken out to dinner. The peculiar thing was that the dinner only lasts 15 minutes. This was a shame because the story could have spent more time on the losers that came to dinner. There was some great talent there, one being Jeff Dunham, a humorous ventriloquist who has been working stand up clubs for the last two decades. It felt like the director (Jay Roach) should have pumped the brakes, slowed up and gave these losers some more screen time. We did get another laugh riot when Therman and Barry had an invisible shoot out between their mind reading capabilities. Then it was over with a nice epilogue to the story through Barry's ""Mouseterpieces"".Should you see this movie? Ummm¬ÖOK, why not? There were some funny bits to it, the storyline was solid and the comedic actors were funny but didn't have to try too hard for the jokes. Rudd plays a good straight man in these situations where Carell and Galifianakis can play off of him quite easily."
The Big Year,2011,6.2,"Two bird enthusiasts try to defeat the cocky, cutthroat world record holder in a year-long bird-spotting competition.","I enjoyed this film. Jack Black can actually act. Who knew? And Steve Martin hasn't done anything this appealing since ""Shopgirl."" It's got some funny moments, and at least two laugh-out-loud moments, but mostly it's a movie with heart. And Black's character will tug at yours a little. Beautifully shot and sharply edited. Lovely scenery and wonderful music. I hope this is still in theaters at Thanksgiving, because it would be the perfect family outing (after devouring the Butterball species). The audience in my theater enjoyed it and some even applauded at the end. Eight is an honest vote, though I was tempted to give it a nine."
Mad Max,1979,6.8,"In a self-destructing world, a vengeful Australian policeman sets out to stop a violent motorcycle gang.","Set somewhere in the future we are privy to a world where the roads are ruled by maniac gangs with souped up cars, and bikers that literally could come from hell. Trying to stop these marauding loons are the overstretched police force who themselves ride in exceptionally fast cars. At the front of this story is Max Rockatansky, a good honest cop trying to hold his own against the chaotic world that is forming around him. After his best friend is burned and left for dead he decides enough is enough and thinks about retiring from the service, but whilst on a vacation with his wife and child things go decidedly bad and Max becomes an avenging force of fury with devastating affect.When evaluating this film I feel it really needs to be put into perspective just how brilliant a job director George Miller did with next to no cash to work with, in fact Miller edited the film in his own bedroom just to emphasise the low-fi nature of the beast. The costumes are excellent, the cast are terrific, with Mel Gibson as Max particularly impressive, and here we have villains to truly fit the word villainous, but it's the stunts and chase sequences that makes this film a rich rewarding experience. The opening ten minutes alone are pure adrenalin pumping genius, but the film as a whole delivers a crash bang wallop punch that has often been imitated since its release, but rarely bettered, and although the heart of the film is a simple revenge story, it grabs your attention and delivers right to the corking finale, 8/10.Footnote: Region 2 Users should note that the bargain bucket Mad Max Trilogy flip pack set still contains the foolishly dubbed version of this film, incredibly stupid move from the American distributors."
Oz the Great and Powerful,2013,6.3,A small-time magician is swept away to an enchanted land and is forced into a power struggle among three witches.,"Oz the Great and Powerful tells the story of how the great wizard Oz from the Wizard of Oz came to be. It follows the young Oz (James Franco) as he is swept away to an enchanted land ending up in the middle of a power struggle between three witches. The young Oz is a trickster who deceives those he wants and/or needs for his own ends. This attitude has consequences and those consequences are what drives the story forward.James Franco plays the young Oz brilliantly. The character is a shallow small time magician and the story shows how he comes full circle to be the Great and Powerful Oz from the Wizard of Oz. Unfortunately, his change happens after taking a grievous toll. The three witches who Oz comes to affect are Theodora (Mila Kunis), Rachel Weisz (Evanora), and Glinda (Michelle Williams). The three play their parts and give great performances to add to their resumes.For those who watched and loved the Wizard of Oz in their childhood, this movie is the perfect prequel. Watching it as an adult was a treat. The writers did well to adapt the script to make it a worthy prequel. In addition, the movie does well to entertain both children and adults. It slots in perfectly as the precursor to the Wizard of Oz.The film didn't have the best reception but I encourage you to ignore this. The directing is probably the weakest link in this movie, but the story and actors more than makeup for this. The character development is amazing and shows exactly why things were they way they are in the Wizard of Oz. Simply stated Oz the Great and Powerful is truly a prefect prequel."
Red Riding Hood,2011,5.4,A teenage girl finds herself in deathly straits when her village sets out to hunt the werewolf that terrorizes it every full moon.,"Is this movie corny? Yes. Are there cliches? Of course. Is it also entertaining, sexy, and fun? 100%. I watched this movie in late high school and now in my mid-20s I still love it. It's a dark take on a classic fairy tale and is entertaining all the way through. The twist in the end took me by surprise, but I am someone who hardly ever sees twists coming, so take that with a grain of salt. This movie is worth a watch. It's not a masterpiece but it is enjoyable if you don't expect anything earth shattering from it."
"Jeff, Who Lives at Home",2011,6.4,"Dispatched from his basement room on an errand for his widowed mother, slacker Jeff might discover his destiny (finally) when he spends the day with his unhappily married brother as he tracks his possibly adulterous wife.","Well, there are two ways to go about this movie. There's the way of a nice superficial 2 or 3 out of 10 and then you can actually try and understand it a bit. This was what I chose.The movie is heartbreaking. It's kind of random and weird but if you go along and stick with it, you can see that this is a masterpiece. The problems it discusses are there more and more frequently the past few years. It's a movie of its time, and it touches all the sensitive issues.It discusses about the alienation between family members as well as our inability to understand the different in all aspects of life, respect it and just nurture it. It also gets into the marital issues that drive so many couples apart. And although these seem a lot, and there are even more, it makes it. It gets you a small sample of everything, emotions flooding and leading you to maybe cry a bit but hopefully be a better person by the end of the movie."
The Change-Up,2011,6.3,"One fateful morning, family man Dave and bachelor Mitch wake up in each other's bodies as a result of a wish they made the previous evening.","An unoriginal plot with clich√©s throughout are forgiven in what is ultimately a feel-good comedy. Bateman and Reynolds have great chemistry, and whilst not groundbreaking, a funny film."
Spring Breakers,2012,5.3,"Four college girls hold up a restaurant in order to fund their spring break vacation. While partying, drinking, and taking drugs, they are arrested, only to be bailed out by a drug and arms dealer.","Can someone explain to me why SPRING BREAKERS was in the comedy section of my local department store? I can only imagine how many people saw this movie sitting on the shelf with it's cover portraying Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson, Rachel Korine, and James Franco in beach-mode and thought, ""Well this movie looks like a fun time! It's like THE HANGOVER for the Disney crowd!"" I am, of course, assuming that the majority of people buying movies from my local department stores are fools who aren't familiar with movie ratings or aware of movie reviews. And I'm pretty sure I'm right. Anyway, SPRING BREAKERS is not a comedy and, if it is, I missed something somewhere. This movie is a 90 minute hallucination and a rough one. It centers on four longtime friends: Candy (Hudgens), Brit (Benson), Cotty (Korine), and Faith (Gomez). Spring Break has arrived and their too poor to leave campus when everyone heads down south to the beaches of Florida for a week of insane debauchery. We receive our first hint that these girls aren't quite right when Candy, Brit, and Cotty decide to rob an all-night chicken shack for their Spring Break funds. From there, it's beaches, booze, and bongs as the girls party it up until their arrested in a narcotics bust when they're in the wrong place at the wrong time. Enter Alien¬Öa wannabe gangster who makes his living dealing drugs and robbing spring-breakers. He bails out the girls and enlists them to join him in business, and it all goes nuts from there.SPRING BREAKERS isn't so much a film as it is an experience. It's a visual journey, popping with neon color and thumping with an electronic soundtrack, that won't settle with most average viewers. I had a friend that wanted to see this movie purely for the bikini-clad stars but I warned him against it because I didn't want to hear the eventual complaints that he had no idea what was going on. While I'm totally cool with helping others experience new movies and different styles of filmmaking, I know there's a line and, in this instance, that line is filmmaker Harmony Korine. There is a story present in SPRING BREAKERS but it's done in such a unique and mind-bending fashion that I guarantee it'll turn a lot of people off. Personally, I enjoyed it. After I first watched it, it didn't take some processing on my part and multiple viewings have only made me appreciate it more. I'm a newbie when it comes to Harmony Korine's previous work. I've never seen KIDS or GUMMO but I've heard enough about them to know I need to check them out at some point. For now, SPRING BREAKERS is my first exposure to his work and it's got my attention. It pits a dark crime story against the vibrant energized atmosphere of the crazy college world of Spring Break. At least, the Spring Break you've seen on MTV¬Ödrunk, sexually jack-up college students going totally insane.This is a movie about evil people. Seriously, all but one person in this movie is a sociopath. The only objectively good person in the movie bails as soon as things start going sour. The most fun is watching the dark side of these girls slowly reveal themselves as the movie goes on. You start to wonder who's really the one being manipulated: these girls or Alien? You know they're not your average college hotties early on when you see how easily crime comes to them, but you don't realize how cold they can be. Despite the girls' rapid descent into the seedier side of Spring Break, the violence isn't over-the-top here. The nudity is¬Öso, you know, this really isn't for the actual longtime fans of people like Hudgens and Gomez. This is their attempt at breaking free from their Disney Channel roots. Hudgens had some success with her turn in SUCKER PUNCH but this secures it. I'm pretty sure pot-smoking and threesomes are a surefire way to bust out of that mold. Gomez doesn't go as nuts here but she's still doing her best to be seen as an actual actress. The performances are pretty good for what they are. James Franco has been receiving a lot of praise for his role as Alien. Honestly, he annoyed me the first time I watched the movie. Horribly. But it wasn't his performance, it's just that people like the grate on my nerves. Franco does a great job here, and it's one of his most strange performances.SPRING BREAKERS isn't for everyone and I'd hope most people would know what they're settling in for if they decide to watch it. It's a gritty, surreal film with some nice eye candy and a foreboding atmosphere playing against the Spring Break wonderland we all envision when we think of college co-eds going nuts. It's a refreshing change from the usual mainstream release, even if it can be a little frustrating to watch at times."
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time,2010,6.5,A young fugitive prince and princess must stop a villain who unknowingly threatens to destroy the world with a special dagger that enables the magic sand inside to reverse time.,"I've never played the Prince of Persia games, but this movie wants me to try one of the games. The movie is very good and the visuals are stunning."
Tooth Fairy,2010,5.1,A bad deed on the part of a tough minor-league hockey player results in an unusual sentence: He must serve one week as a real-life tooth fairy.,"This is a cute film. I enjoyed it. I think it did what it was supposed to do, it made me laugh and was easy to watch. One of the few bad things I have to say about it is that it's formulaic, a little long and you know what the outcome will be before it gets there. Regardless of that, Dwayne, Julie, Billy and the English fellow do their part to make the film worth while, while Ms. Judd and the child actors make the story come together. There's a fair amount of whimsy and reality which makes it great for children and adults who are children at heart, the little cameo by Seth Macfarlane doesn't hurt either. All it in all it's not the best, but it's not the worst."
Jack Reacher,2012,7.0,"Jack Reacher, a homicide investigator, digs deeper into a case involving a trained military sniper responsible for a mass shooting.","Reviewers say 'Jack Reacher' is an entertaining action thriller with mixed opinions on Tom Cruise's portrayal. Many praise Cruise's charisma, though some find him miscast. Action sequences, especially the car chase, are lauded. Plot and pacing receive varied feedback, with some finding it engaging and others slow. Rosamund Pike and Werner Herzog's performances are highlighted. The film's potential as a franchise is discussed. Overall, it's a decent watch with strong action but room for improvement in storytelling."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,2013,5.7,The G.I. Joes are not only fighting their mortal enemy Cobra; they are forced to contend with threats from within the government that jeopardize their very existence.,"¬®Call me JOE¬®As a kid I was a huge fan of the GI Joe cartoons and had a vast collection of the action figures, but I never thought it was a very good idea to bring the franchise to the big screen. I didn't like the first film despite all the great special effects because the entire concept was just way too silly, and I didn't like this film all that much either despite the fact it had a better story and some more interesting characters. What really saved this film for me was a ten minute action scene in the mountains which was pretty amazing and made the entire movie worthwhile. It was one of the best action scenes I've seen all year. This second film was directed by Jon M. Chu (Justin Bieber Never Say Never and Step Up 2) and the screenplay co-written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (Zombieland), but very few actors are back from the original movie (only five) so this felt like a totally different movie. Retaliation is much better than Rise of Cobra but it still felt a little light due to the nonstop action. It's one of those movies you can enjoy for two hours but forget about once it's over. What it does have going for it is that is includes better action stars like The Rock and Bruce Willis. The Rock is probably one of the best contemporary action stars and he already brought the Fast and Furious franchise back alive again. He doesn't quite do the same with GI Joe, but he still makes this movie a little more enjoyable than the original one. Despite all the cheesiness of the plot I still had some fun, and the producers knew that the premise couldn't be taken seriously so they just played around with it.The Joes continue to serve and protect the world under the leadership of Captain Duke (Channing Tatum) and his team which consists of Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock), Flint (D.J. Cotrona), and Jaye (Adrianne Palicki). They have a couple of successful missions until the team is betrayed by the US president (Jonathan Pryce) who is actually Zartan (Arnold Vosloo) infiltrated as him. Thus the Joes are forced to fight enemy forces inside their own government and are forced to receive help from the only person they can trust: retired General Joe Colton (Bruce Willis). Meanwhile Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) has conceived a plan with Firefly (Ray Stevenson) to free their imprisoned Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey). Snake Eyes (Ray Park) is determined to stop him with the help of Jinx (Elodie Yung), but the Joes are running out of time with the President threatening the world with a nuclear war. Will the Joes be able to stop the Cobra team before they destroy the entire world?Channing Tatum and The Rock shared some funny scenes together and had great chemistry, but I would have enjoyed more screen time with them. Adrianne Palicki looked great in that red dress and was a good addition to the film. Cotrona and Willis didn't do much, but the highlight of the film was the mountain action sequence between Park and Lee. The film had its extremely cheesy moments, and I couldn't believe they even didn't care about the explosion of London. They continued as if nothing ever happened and celebrated the success of the mission without considering the devastating loss. I think that was probably the worst part of the film and the entire scene was probably used to attract people through the trailers. Retaliation is big and loud, anticipation for what is to come in the blockbuster summer movies. By the time summer gets here we will probably have forgotten all about this movie, but it was still a fun and entertaining two hours. Even those people that will end up hating this film will have to agree that the ten minute action scene between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow was pretty entertaining. As long as you don't think too much about what's going on you might enjoy this senseless film."
Mad Max 2,1981,7.6,"In the post-apocalyptic Australian wasteland, a cynical drifter agrees to help a small, gasoline-rich community get rid of a horde of bandits.","Studio executives today could use a film like this one, or its predecessor right about now. The Mad Max films were thrown together with great skill on absolutely shoestring budgets and made a king's ransom in profits. Nowadays we just seem to get one big-budget failure after another, as the box office slump now extends into its fourteenth week.Mad Max 2 (or The Road Warrior, as it is commonly called here in the USA) is an extraordinary sight to behold. The story centers on a loner (Mel Gibson) who roams the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Australia in search of gasoline so he can... I guess just keep driving. He is a man who lost his wife and child to a murderous gang of bikers in the previous film. He seems to be without a soul, or any feeling for his fellow man. One day he corners a man who tells him about a refining community besieged by a gang of ruthless outlaws. Thirsty for the large amount of fuel this community has, Max barters his way inside. To his dismay, the community has no plans to let him just take the fuel and run. They use him to provide them with a vehicle ""big enough to haul that fat tank of gas"", and by the climax of the film, he is driving the fuel through a gang of about fifty or more savages looking to take it for themselves. Max never really endears himself to anyone, but you can feel the humanity within him as he volunteers to drive the tanker. After just surviving a horrendous accident he can barely walk, but he knows he's their only chance.This film is absolutely breathtaking. The characters we meet inside the walls of the refining community are stubborn and resourceful, but just not strong enough to deal with ""that vermin on machines"" waiting outside for them. The vicious gang holding the community hostage are a motley crew of desperadoes. Many are dressed like WWE combatants. Some are even dressed in MFP uniforms similar to what Max and his fellow officers wore in part one. Are they former cops gone bad, or did they murder the cops to get the uniforms? We are never told. The script refers to these men as ""GAYBOY BERSERKERS"". The various motorcycles, hot rods, and trucks used in the film have to be seen to be believed. Maybe more fuel-efficient vehicles would be a better idea for a world so short on fuel! But these souped-up vehicles make for some great chase scenes! You have to hand it to the stunt men who worked on this film. With no CGI to do the work for them, many of them were putting their lives at risk each day. Both stunt team leaders Max Aspin and Guy Norris were severely injured during filming. Aspin was driving the car that went airborne after we see the driver shot in the back with the four-way arrow gun. I believe he suffered a concussion when it landed just short of the fortress wall. Norris shattered his ankle after being launched off a motorcycle and sent flying through the air in one spectacular shot during the final chase scene.The film has a great soundtrack, as well by Brian May. (Not the guy from Queen) Not too many lines are spoken throughout the film, but so what? This is a film about action, and it's a treat to watch it any time. The Hound will give it 10 of 10 stars. What a way to introduce American moviegoers to Mel Gibson!!"
Mein F√ºhrer - Die wirklich wahrste Wahrheit √ºber Adolf Hitler,2007,5.5,This action comedy is set in 1944. Hitler appears in it as a physically and mentally destroyed person who takes the advice of Goebbels and goes to a Jewish concentration camp to receive lessons in eloquence to inspire the German people to continue to fight.,Imagine this as a big piece of cake top with comedy and end with drama.
Django Unchained,2012,8.5,"With the help of a German bounty-hunter, a freed slave sets out to rescue his wife from a brutal plantation owner in Mississippi.","Reviewers say 'Django Unchained' is acclaimed for its daring themes and strong performances by Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, and Leonardo DiCaprio. The film's cinematography, soundtrack, and Tarantino's style are lauded, yet it faces criticism for excessive violence, pacing, and tonal issues. Some find its use of racial slurs and graphic slavery depictions problematic. Despite these concerns, it remains a notable entry in Tarantino's work, offering a provocative experience."
Sukiyaki uesutan Jango,2007,6.1,"A nameless gunfighter arrives in a town ripped apart by rival gangs and, though courted by both to join, chooses his own path.","Sometimes a film presents itself to you as a character, whole in definition, with whom you have to deal. This is possible either because the film has a soul that the artist has created, or because the filmmaker borrows one by hijacking a genre. That is what Miike has done here. Though some of his other experiments sit well with me, this does not.Dealing with such a character is not a simple emotional (and sometimes intellectual) transaction. Sometimes it is a struggle, a contest where each party wants to pull the other into their own world. Even these than be worthwhile, but the chances go way down; motives get questioned, selves get examined when you have to struggle.I saw this together with 'Rango.' Same strategy, and even many of the same references. But as thin as Rango was, it presented a worthy character. Whether you choose to argue or even try to win is up to you. But at least you should choose your encounters wisely.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."
Super 8,2011,7.0,"During the summer of 1979, a group of friends witness a train crash and investigate subsequent unexplained events in their small town.","I'm just going to say this upfront, Super 8 is now one of my favorite movies. It is one of the most thrilling , emotional, well-acted and just all around entertaining movies I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies. It brings back that old school movie feel of wonder and innocence that made movies like E.T. , Stand By Me, and the Goonies , the classics that they are now and I think Super 8 is right in the same league. But Super 8 has another side to it as well, it's a monster movie. This aspect is obviously modeled after other Spielberg classics like Jurassic Park and Jaws and uses some of the same techniques to great effect.As I said above, the acting is amazing. All the kids are absolutely fantastic they really act like real teenagers- the way they talk, the way they act and all their different quirks are all hilarious. It's so fun watching them all together. The adults are all great too particularly Kyle Chandler who plays the main character, Joe's, father. He perfectly displays his difficulty in the situation he is in and his lack of communication with his son.Super 8 is actually a very emotional movie. Joe and his father have been through some tragic events and they are still trying to cope with their loss. There is some real depth in the emotional scenes and this makes you care more for the character and it makes the movie much more intense when the action starts heating up. That brings me to the next great aspect of the movie, the action.There are some very intense scenes in Super 8. The movie has one of the most awesome scenes of destruction (the train crash) I have seen in a movie, and its in the first thirty minutes. After this is when the unseen monster starts causing havoc. What's great is that you hardly ever see the monster. It's just like Jaws, the less you see, the scarier things are. This makes it so that once you see the monster it is very satisfying.There are flaws in the movie such as the drastic change in tones between the lighthearted events with the kids to the pretty dark and violent scenes with the monster, and the movie ends a little bit too soon, but this is all negligible because the movie is so entertaining, moving, and heartfelt.http://evsmoviezone.wordpress.com/2011/06/12/review-super-8/"
50/50,2011,7.6,"Inspired by a true story, a comedy centered on a 27-year-old guy who learns of his cancer diagnosis and his subsequent struggle to beat the disease.","How many drama movies about cancer treatment, with suffering performances and a true story of overcoming have been made and even became tiresome way? Well, the young director Jonathan Levine and Will Reiser (screenplay) found a formidable new vision of it all.The film tells the story of Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a young man of twenty-seven years working for a radio company in Seattle. He is informed that he has a rare form of cancer called ""Neurofibrosarcoma"", and is told he only has a 50% chance to live with him. Frustrated, but moving day to day with a seemingly calm, with the help of his friend Kyle (Seth Rogen), Adam continues his long journey of recovery. Only to be bothered by his irritating, selfish girlfriend Rachel (Bryce Dallas Howard). But with the help of the, half embarrassed but very helpful, psychologist Katherine (Anna Kendrick). Adam then proceeds to deal with their illness and can remain calm during most part of the film.There are so many forms of cancer, rare and common, harmless and that their chances of getting it are very high. Start is random, but dealing with it is even more difficult. While ""50/50"" is a moving, and sometimes it is emotion-test and tearful, he still has a strong comic relief thanks to Seth Rogen, and several occasions that Adam and Kyle meddle.The film is a drama, that works as a comedy very well written. Some may find this a defect, but rather a quality. Adam throughout the film faces its situation near death in a lively manner. It's as if the film were telling us, ""if it is your last minutes, let then be smiling!"".The cast is terrific, even comic, Seth manages to have an interesting dramatic performance; Anna Kendrick formidable as ever; Angelica Houston and Serge Houde as Adam's parents with great performances; but who shines above everyone is Joseph Levitt with a fantastic performance, proving to be an very promising actor.Thanks to a wonderful third act, in terms of direction and screenplay that never fail or work against the film at any time, the public has an emotional breakdown all of the characters and the story itself and fantastic to witness."
Scoop,2006,6.6,"An American journalism student in London scoops a big story, and begins an affair with an aristocrat as the incident unfurls.","In this somewhat familiar story, the now-70-year-old Woody Allen plays a rambling stage magician in London who gets unwillingly roped into helping a young woman (Scarlett Johansson) find out the true identity of a potential serial killer (Hugh Jackman). The girl is an aspiring reporter who receives a tip from the spirit of a recently deceased writer that Jackman may be her man.Woody had just made the superior and steamy drama MATCH POINT (2005) with Scarlett Johansson and was probably taken with her, so he tried casting her here alongside himself in something comical. At least he's beginning to realize he has become too long in the tooth to continue playing younger girls' love interests, and so he assumes the role of go-between mentor to the two young leads. Unsurprisingly, Jackman and Johansson are destined to become romantically involved as Scarlett pursues her investigation. Hugh Jackman is fine in his part, and though upon my first viewing of this I didn't quite buy Johansson's performance, a second look found her characterization working for me.This film is only occasionally humorous and rather middle of the road as far as the director's overall dossier is concerned. I'm always game to continue seeing Woody cast himself in his own future comedies, so long as he keeps writing them more in line with his advancing age. Who knows, maybe he can make a senior citizen type of farce one day. **1/2 out of ****"

Stone won his first Oscar for Midnight express (1978), but his fame was just beginning to show ."
Duplicity,2009,6.1,Two corporate spies become embroiled in a clandestine love affair.,"We need more filmmakers like Tony Gilroy in Hollywood right now. Coming off of his debut feature Michael Clayton, after years of working on stuff like the Bourne movies, to his second film Duplicity, he's marked some strong territory as a guy who can work with top-shelf A-list talent and put them in material that is mature just enough to make it safe for the 30+ year olds to see it and not think their intelligence is being wasted. His films provide such a wealth of juicy scenes of dialog and plots that make us think about what the characters will do next as opposed to just spoon-feeding along the conventions. And even if Duplicity is not quite as excellent as his first film (and suffice to say it's got a couple of things that make it tick) it's still a marker of fine entertainment. At the least, it makes for a strong matin√©e viewing, if one were to rate it such.Like one of those features from the 40s or 50s from Hitchcock where he would place Cary Grant and (insert blonde bombshell here), Duplicity relies on its stars, and sometimes its dependable character actor supporting players, to make it more about watching them and how they go about the material as opposed to the real specifics of what to worry in the plot itself. Hitchcock wasn't worried about what was really in the ""secret"" formula since he knew, maybe rightfully so, that the audience doesn't really care either. When will Grant and Kelly have that kiss? It's certainly a lot more fun trying to explain how well Clive Owen and Julia Roberts fit into this classic Hollywood couple mold (not to mention since it's their second time on-screen following the more theater-based Closer) and play off one another than describing how ""one is a MI6 and the other CIA and their operatives in these corporate firms and one might be making a toaster oven or yada yada and they both do A and B and...""So yeah, basically Duplicity is about conning and about not believing what the other person is saying, but at the same time Gilroy toys around with the idea of people who are stuck in a world where by proxy they can't trust one another but get each other so well who the other is at the same time. The characters Tom Wilkinson and Paul Giamatti play- who, by the way, share one of the funniest and most awesome opening credits sequences I've seen in years- are playing checkers in their corporate one-oneupmanship games, but it's Roberts and Owen that are playing chess which is a little brainier but trickier at the same time.One might criticize that there's almost too much of this back-and-forth guessing and curiously trying to figure out what the other is saying about something. But if done right in a film it can be fun to watch just to see what move or motive or revelation will come next. And Gilroy has casted these two stars so perfectly that you can lose yourself in these scenes where they keep playing the same guessing games (some dialog deliberately repeated). This helps especially when the actual plot becomes a little silly, and particularly when it's revealed in the last ten minutes what the big TWIST has occurred. It won't do any good to explain what it is, but suffice to say it's a little too convenient to put into exposition, and it's been done before. In a script that is otherwise sharp and clever and dramatically pleasing in construction and character Gilroy falls back on a couple of tired devices towards the end.It comes dangerously close, as Ebert pointed out, to saying simply ""who cares?"" But, thankfully, Duplicity does, for at least roughly in total 2/3 of the running time, give us characters to care about and go along for the ride with and so have this sheer joy of an A-list movie that tries to be about the guessing game and cons and covert operations and the nature of this whole thing Gilroy's dealing with. And the last shot, thankfully, tries to put a good coda on everything that's happened. It's a glossy, breezy time in usually the best way. 7.5/10"
The Lorax,2012,6.4,"A 12-year-old boy searches for the one thing that will enable him to win the affection of the girl of his dreams. To find it he must discover the story of the Lorax, the grumpy yet charming creature who fights to protect his world.",I've only just got around to watching this film and I've got to say It's got a great message and this world needs to listen to it.Overall it's roots were strong and it had a great sense of humour and also had a dark side to it.Good animation
Fair Game,2010,6.8,CIA operative Valerie Plame discovers her identity is allegedly leaked by the government as payback for an op-ed article her husband wrote criticizing the Bush administration.,"Valerie Plame Wilson (Naomi Watts) is a woman with double life: she is the wife of the former Ambassador Joe Wilson (Sean Penn) and mother of two children. But she is also and efficient CIA Operations Officer working in the Nonproliferation Center and in charge of several operations.In 2003, when Bush administration manipulates the information relative to massive destruction weapons to justify the invasion of Iraq, Joe Wilson writes an article in the New York Times criticizing the government and telling that the intelligence research had been manipulated. In reprisal, the government leaks Valerie's identity to discredit Joe, affecting their professional and private lives and almost destroying their marriage.""Fair Game"" is a bold film about the life of Valerie Plame Wilson, who has had her life destroyed by Bush administration in part of the farce about the existence of massive destruction weapons in Iraq to justify the invasion of that nation. But it seems that later the Wilson family wrote two books and won lawsuits against members of the government and they might have resolved their lives at least financially speaking.The film glances also at the lives of Iraqi scientists that trusted on Valerie and were murdered by the Iraqi secret service, but does not show the fate of the civilian population that had their country bombed and invaded due to a farce. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Jogos de Poder"" (""Power Game"")"
The Artist,2011,7.8,"When George, a silent movie superstar, meets Peppy Miller, a dancer, sparks fly between the two. However, after the introduction of talking pictures, their fortunes change, affecting their dynamic.","What a treat. I left the theater sort of floating. Delighted. A European film looking back at Hollywood better than Hollywood has been able to do for years. ""A Star Is Born"" and ""Singing In The Rain"" mixed in a glorious black and white cocktail. Silent, yes silent! But with a fabulous score and so much panache. Jean Dujardin is the revelation of the year. What a performance! Running the gamut of emotions, leaving us breathless, and if this wasn't enough, a rousing tap dance routine in the style of Fred Astaire and Eleanor Powell, partnering with the wonderful Berenice Bejo. I know that it's not just me. The audience applauded and cheered as the end credits rolled."
Battle Royale,2000,7.5,"In the future, the Japanese government captures a class of ninth-grade students and forces them to kill one another under the revolutionary ""Battle Royale"" act.",I saw on a youtube video that this was one of Quentin Tarantino favourite films and that he regreted not making it. He was right. It is one of the best asian films ever made.
Tyrannosaur,2011,7.5,"Joseph, a man plagued by violence and a rage that is driving him to self-destruction, earns a chance of redemption that appears in the form of Hannah, a Christian charity shop worker.","Recently Hollywood and the various film industries across the globe have seen an upsurge in the amount of on-screen performers who are taking a break from acting in front of the camera to instead take control from behind it. Paddy Considine, the star of 'This is England' and 'Dead Man's Shoes,' is now a member of this increasingly growing club with his first feature-film debut 'Tyrannosaur'. Written and Directed by Considine, this is an uncompromising debut film from the former photographer, which examines the destructive effects of violence and aggressive behaviour on the lives of two different individuals who are drawn together through their developing friendship.Joseph (Peter Mullan) is a lonely, cynical, and belligerent working class man. He spends his days drinking alone in the Pub and gambling in the local bookmakers where his only friends reside. Violent and abusive outbursts govern his existence thereby creating a solitary creature who acts on instinct rather than reasoning. However, Joseph's life changes when he meets and befriends Hannah (Olivia Colman), a local Christian woman who is constantly being verbally and physically abused by her sadistic husband James (Eddie Marsan). Both tortured souls, they find solace in each other's lives and develop a friendship which transcends their misgivings.'Tyrannosaur' is an uncompromising, and at times, difficult film to watch as the characters' lives are laid bare for the whole audience to observe. Joseph responds to problematic situations through the use of his fists, while Hannah simply acts out of fear and denial. Both Peter Mullan and Olivia Colman give fantastic performances; Mullan is initially a brutish, vagrant looking male who can't naturally become entwined in society, but as the film develops, empathy begins to grow for a man who accepts his short-comings and the fact that he may never be able to overcome them. With humanity arising slowly from his dishevelled face through his relationship with the young, neighbourhood boy Sam (Samuel Bottomley).While Colman's striking performance, which is far-cry away from her role on the hit British comedy series 'Peep Show,' shows a woman who is conflicted in all manner of her beliefs. Her religious beliefs give her the naivety to believe that her husband can change, while her heart knows that he will only stop hurting her when her beatings become fatal. This is most notable in the scene where James breaks down in tears at her feet after striking out at Hannah, as she cradles his head he constantly professes his love for her repeating the phrase ""it won't happen again, you know it won't happen again."" Hannah constantly reaffirms his worries saying that she does love him, but as she lowers his head, the camera observes her changing emotions as the audience is shown that Hannah is clearly not a woman in love with James, but instead she is simply afraid of him.Considine's first directorial effort is certainly a competent effort, he never attempts to direct the audience's attention too far from the script or the two central performances at hand, but this itself is the film's primary flaw. While it is captivating and emotionally unsettling, it is also a narrative which is not uncommon in modern British cinema (or known to some as 'miserable British cinema'), and it portrays the same judgements and ideals as many of its predecessors did before without providing anything new to the sub-genre at hand, especially in the culmination of the sub-plot involving the young boy Sam and his neglectful mother and boyfriend.Despite its unoriginality in the narrative's conclusive mediation, the film still manages to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer through its combination of horrifying visuals and fragile performances from the two lead British actors, as Paddy Considine begins his feature film journey with a solid and respectable character portrait of two broken individuals."
Iron Man 3,2013,7.1,"When Tony Stark's world is torn apart by a formidable terrorist called the Mandarin, he starts an odyssey of rebuilding and retribution.","Reviewers say 'Iron Man 3' is acclaimed for Tony Stark's character development and Robert Downey Jr.'s performance, blending depth with humor. However, the film's plot twists, particularly the Mandarin's portrayal, receive criticism for being disappointing and inconsistent. Action sequences and special effects are generally praised, though some note a reduction in Iron Man action. The darker tone and humor elicit mixed reactions. Overall, 'Iron Man 3' is considered a solid Marvel entry, though it falls short of the first film's impact."
The Guard,2011,7.3,An unorthodox Irish policeman with a confrontational personality is partnered with an uptight F.B.I. agent to investigate an international drug-smuggling ring.,"Screenplay writer John Michael McDonagh's directorial debut, ""The Guard"" (2011) is really a fine movie, relying the least on the originality of its story, describing criminal proceedings of the group of cocaine drug-smugglers and their interaction with local police, set against the backdrop of small-town western Ireland, however, filled with crackling good dialogue, sparkling with wisecracks, accompanied with nice scenery and pleasant, unobtrusive music. But, what makes it the best is its protagonists' performances.Brendan Gleeson is usually natural, making the character he plays fit like a glove‚Äîwhether the robust and humorous loyal buddy and the warrior, as in ""Braveheart"" (1995), or a quiet and subdued aspiring politician, as in ""Gangs of New York"" (2002), or a non-supportive father, civil war volunteer-turned-deserter, as in ""Cold Mountain"" (2003), whether the gentle, mentoring, culture-exploring hit man in hiding, as in ""In Bruges"" (2008), or on the other side of the law, the grouchy police sergeant with defiant, often dissident sense of humour (provocative in one-liners like ""being FBI, don't you prefer to fight unarmed women and children¬Ö""), as in this movie--and Don Cheadle, in the role of FBI agent Wendell Everett, a bit in the shade of Gleeson's Gerry Boyle, but nevertheless, sufficiently competitive (""Langley is CIA, I'm FBI¬Ö""), neat and convincing in his performance as always. (I admit to have a soft spot for this actor since his impressive role of the manager of Kigali Mille Collines hotel in the movie ""Hotel Rwanda"" (2004), the very same hotel I have been frequenting for two months in 1995, just a year later to tragic events described in the movie.)To a pretty frequent movie goer like myself, who hasn't seen a single en par (or better?) leading actor in this year that is rapidly advancing towards its end, it is hard to believe that very many better acting performances could be demonstrated in the remaining two months or so. Therefore, if Brendan Gleeson does not find himself at least among top nominees for any yearly awarded film prize, I'll have a problem finding such decisions just.As a marginal note, I was lucky to watch this movie back home in my motherland, because having it subtitled was very helpful in order not to miss any of sergeant Boyle's wisecracks, delivered often in heavy Irish accent, and to understand at all occasional lines, uttered by marginal characters, spoken completely in Gaelic. Of course, point was not to be understood by English native speakers, but it was still interesting to know what usual ""advices"" (if not insults) were given to English speakers, though eventually not English (as FBI agent!) at all. As Irish colleague of mine once said¬Ö ""We don't sing songs in Gaelic so English people cannot understand how badly we talk about them, they know it already! We sing in Gaelic simply because that's our traditional language (N.B. official whatsoever), and songs sound much better and sweeter in it."""
Law Abiding Citizen,2009,7.4,A frustrated man decides to take justice into his own hands after a plea bargain sets one of his family's killers free.,"I am just not sure which is which.I am trying to avoid spoilers here, because it is a definite film you must check out because it is a great new take on the prison based thriller genre, which provides 90 odd minutes of great entertainment with lots of twists and turns to keep the story fresh.My main criticism is that the story seems to twist and turn so much it gets itself into a nasty tangle. The base of any thriller for an audience, is to want the protagonist to prosper at the downfall of the antagonist, but at the end, i was unsure which of one of the two mains, Nick Rice (foxx) or Clyde Shelton (butler) i should be 'cheering' for.Each Character has their fair amount of being the good guy, but both were more of the bad guy, a very confusing aspect to a thriller.Never-the-less, there are some brilliant performances and a very entertaining fresh story kept me glued to the screen for the entirety of the movie.****/5"
Melancholia,2011,7.1,Two sisters find their already strained relationship challenged as a mysterious new planet threatens to collide with Earth.,"This is not an easy movie to watch. It's tough from the very beginning - a prologue prequel with music by Wagner and an apocalyptic perspective. Any movie in which dead birds fall from the sky in the first three minutes is not going to be light and fluffy.But this movie, about deep melancholia experienced by Justine (Kirstin Dunst), the principal character, and the melancholia of the potential end of life itself, is an artistic triumph. Great acting, great cinematography, great music. Even the sometimes puzzling plot - the post-prologue movie comes in two halves - is engrossing and pregnant with underlying meaning. The three principal characters all represent a point on the compass of human feelings: Depression, anxiety, and something resembling nice normalcy. How each deals with the apocalypse is a well-threaded effort.While the movie is dark, it is by no means humorless. The wedding that occupies the first half of the movie has a great deal of fun alongside the depression.Not a movie for everyone, and a bit too long, but if you watch it, stick with it. You may not want to see it twice but you could be glad you saw it once."
Hugo,2011,7.5,"In 1931 Paris, an orphan living in the walls of a train station gets wrapped up in a mystery involving his late father and an automaton.","Martin Scorsese's HUGO is a family movie that will probably only cater to a niche crowd: people who appreciate movies as art (e.g. cinema snobs, though I use the term endearingly). I'm not saying it won't appeal to the general masses. It's still an interesting story, wonderfully acted, and packed with talent both in front of and behind the camera. But let's face it: this isn't your average movie, it's a love letter. Scorsese has been a vocal supporter of restoring old movies in hopes they'll be saved from oblivion (rightfully so) and this movie, based on a children's book by Brian Selznick, is his method of beautifully pleading his case before millions of people who've probably refuse to watch black and white movies on the basis that they're, you know, black and white (yes, I know those sorts of people). HUGO is a film meant to bring out attention to the movies long-forgotten and remind us of the magic behind them, told through the adventure of a young boy named Hugo Cabret. Hugo is an orphan whose father died in a museum fire, and he lives behind the walls of a Parisian train station. When he's not busy with his job of keeping the station clocks ticking, Hugo spends his time repairing an old automaton his father rescued from museum storage. An encounter with a curmudgeonly toy store owner and his granddaughter Isabelle will send Hugo on a journey to repair the automaton and discover its long-hidden secrets.As I mentioned, this movie will only really appeal to certain people. Scorsese fans might be put off by the fact that this film is a family-friendly adventure; it doesn't exactly fall in line with Scorsese's usual subject matter. The family crowds will probably enjoy it, but younger children will likely be put off by it's slow pacing and lack of excitement. It's not so much an adventure as a journey of discovery, and little kids might not find themselves too involved in the story. My own daughter (4, going on 5) gave it an honest try when we sat down to watch it and made it 40 minutes or so before she fell asleep. Unfortunately, HUGO will probably be one of those films that fades into the background (if it hasn't already) and find most of it's loving coming from the film school crowds. The movie incorporates a loose interpretation of the life of Georges M√©li√®s, a stage magician and an early innovator in world of cinema who realized the potential for the new medium of storytelling. At a time when most ""movies"" were just real-world situations recorded to celluloid (such as the famous train pulling into the station), M√©li√®s created fantastic stories and mythical tales to entertain, filling his films with special effects and dramatic costuming. The movie focuses on the fact that so many of M√©li√®s' films were lost over time and the tragedy of these classics from one of the earliest, most important filmmakers, ceasing to exist.Scorsese makes his message perfectly clear in the final half of the movie, which happened to be my favorite part of the film. Ben Kingsley is Papa Georges (M√©li√®s) and, in the film, he is a defeated man who mourns the death of his legacy following World War I. Kingsley is perfect here and the highlight of the movie. The children in the film, Asa Butterfield and Chlo√´ Moretz, do a serviceable job but, as is usually the case with younger actors, their performances come off as forced and wooden most times. Even Moretz, who's performances I freakin' loved in KICK-ASS, doesn't feel real here. Maybe it's just that Scorsese isn't accustomed to working with younger talent and wasn't able to bring out the best in them, but it's a shame because the two of them are the key players in the movie. There's a handful of other minor roles filling out the film with talent: Christopher Lee, Ray Winstone, Jude Law, etc. My favorite would probably be Sascha Baron Cohen (yes, Borat) as the station inspector. With his Doberman patrolling by his side and the frame providing support for his bum leg, he was almost cartoonish. I loved him, and he was more than capable of toning down his usual eccentricity. HUGO is a movie with a lot to love, even more if you're a cinema snob. I really enjoyed it, but a slow first act and weak performances from the kids mean it's far from perfect. HUGO has my full recommendation for anyone who might want a glimpse into world of a true film-lover."
Det sjunde inseglet,1957,8.1,"A knight returning to Sweden after the Crusades seeks answers about life, death, and the existence of God as he plays chess against the Grim Reaper during the Black Plague.","Reviewers say 'The Seventh Seal' delves into mortality, faith, and existential questions through its medieval setting. The chess game with Death symbolizes humanity's struggle against fate. Themes of societal chaos and religious fervor are depicted through plague, witch burnings, and flagellants. Characters like the knight, squire, and actors provide varied perspectives on life and death, enriching the narrative. The film's allegorical approach resonates with contemporary audiences, highlighting the timeless nature of its themes."
How I Spent My Summer Vacation,2012,6.9,A career criminal nabbed by Mexican authorities is placed in a tough prison where he learns to survive with the help of a young boy.,"i didn't expect this movie being so good, but it's turned out to be not just good but great! Mel Gibson did an outrageously great performance in this movie. an ingenious screenplay with very interesting storyline, not even one second not suspenseful. the directing is way too smooth, the editing, all the Mexican supporting actors, every one of them did such great seamless job like one of the colorful thread being woven so expertly into a wonderful carpet with beautiful and complicated patterns. salute to the director, the three screenplay writers (one of them is Mr. Gibson). this is a very difficult film to shoot but just, again, seamlessly fabricated into a great one. this is a rare film combined with nervous breaking scenarios and plots but at the same time, never forgot to deliver a subtle sense of humor. this is one of the best movies I've ever seen and i believe that most viewers who watched it would agree with me totally. go watch it, guys. I'd also like to congrats Mr. Gibson that he never did anything plastic, not even Botox injections on his old face, yet every wrinkle, every line only makes him an even greater performer. what a treat! thank you, Mr. Gibson, stay cool."
Star Trek: Into Darkness,2013,7.7,"After the crew of the Enterprise find an unstoppable force of terror from within their own organization, Captain Kirk leads a manhunt to a war-zone world to capture a one-man weapon of mass destruction.","As much as I liked Abrams' 2009 re-boot of the Star Trek series, I liked this second installment better. I think that's because there was less of an obligation to fill up back-story, and more ability to go deeper both into plot, and into the emotions of these new, younger versions of the characters we now (re) know. Add to that Benedict Cumberbatch makes a complex and compelling villain, even if the character does borrow from other sources, including Rutger Hauer in ""Blade Runner"".The humor is funny, the emotional scenes have a real impact, the battles are exciting, the acting is excellent, the plot twists are clever, and the more epic 'big' moments are really effective.There are flaws; some plot twists can be seen coming a mile off, there are a few painful cheats or jumps in logic, and a handful of too-easy coincidences. But for a big summer blockbuster this has more smarts, style, punch and humanity than most."
Sliding Doors,1998,6.7,"After personal and professional setbacks, a woman experiences an alternate reality.","Very well made with a nice witty script and a decent pace so it doesn't get bogged down too much. It does look slightly dated though, but that's mostly to do with things like fashion and technology.I must admit I did find the premise of this film quite interesting; how just a couple of seconds at a crucial moment can make drastic changes to a life did intrigue me. I did enjoy the way it was done but ultimately it is about feelings and relationships which is fine as far as it goes. It did leave me with a few questions by the end and I see that as a good thing; there were certain things open to interpretation and any film that does that is always going to be worth a look, in my view. I will admit I did enjoy it up to a point; I found the characters quite engaging, there is some great dialogue and I even recognised one or two of the tunes! Over all, worth a look but I feel its one of those I'll only watch once (although I've been wrong about that before).SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.2/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."
Killing Them Softly,2012,6.2,"Jackie Cogan is an enforcer hired to restore order after three dumb guys rob a Mob protected card game, causing the local criminal economy to collapse.","Andrew Dominik's third feature is an interesting, often entertaining but also frustrating crime thriller which reunites the Australian film-maker with Jesse James star Brad Pitt. The film features severe brutality and wonderful performances but the elements that should have stayed in the subtext are beaten into the audience as much as much the hapless characters.Adapted from George V. Higgins' novel and set in New Orleans against the back drop of the Wall Street Banking Crisis and the 2008 Presidential election, Killing them Softly is a crime thriller with a socio-economic message not so much on its sleeve but carved on its forehead. Scoot McNairy (Monsters) and Ben Mendelsohn (last seen in The Dark Knight Rises) play two na√Øve crooks who agree to rob a Mob-protected high stakes poker game for a local small time gangster named the Squirrel (The Sopranos' Vincent Curatola). The bosses suspect Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta), the game's manager who is more guilty for his negligence than his complicity. Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt), an efficient and clinical hit man is brought in by a mysterious lawyer (the ever great Richard Jenkins) - with connections to an unidentified network of authorities inside and out of the underworld - to clean up the entire mess.Dominik seems to relish in deconstructing audiences perceptions of gangster-genre veterans such as James Gandolfini, Curatola, and Liotta. The three are somewhat weak characters who are simply small fish in a very big and dangerous pond. Liotta particularly is a quivering, cowering tragic character ‚Äì completely removed from the swagger he exemplified in Goodfellas. Gandolfini too retains some of his magnetic threatening persona but he is a hit man with a broken heart and a broke n liver from his alcoholism and penchant for prostitutes. The rest of the supporting cast is superb with Sam Shephard, Richard Jenkins and Slaine (seen in Ben Affleck's The Town and Gone Baby Gone) all delivering strong but all-to-brief contributions to the film. Pitt is maintaining his consistency with another confident and compelling performance. He imbues Cogan with empathy ‚Äì exemplified by his tact of assassinating his targets ""softly"" ‚Äì yet he is direct and unyielding in his objectives. His speech at the climax of the movie set against Barack Obama's election victory speech is electrifying and among Pitt's finest work.Killing them Softly is a violent film. The beatings are rough and severe and you feel every punch ‚Äì every broken tooth, every crack in the jaw, every smashed nose. The gunshots are loud and frightening. The gangster life is in no way romantic or glamorous. It's a kill or be killed environment and those who hesitate to be ruthless and driven in their mission are victims. It's a Darwinian environment where ""hope"" and ""change"" are just words printed on dilapidated billboards.The plot of the film is very simple but Dominik rather slows down the action and focus on the characters. It's almost surprising the film ends when it does as one does not know what to expect or where the story is heading. There is an uncertainty in the pacing of the film that is quite apparent. Furthermore, rumours that Dominik's original cut was 2 and half hours (the finished film is a brisk 97 minutes) give weight to the belief that Dominik had much more ambitious plans. It's easy to speculate about the reasons for such a massive cut to footage (studio pressure perhaps) but Dominik seems to mistrust his audience to ""get"" the sub textual themes and motifs. It's painfully apparent that the heist and subsequent fallout is an allegory for the Economic Crisis and the cutthroat crime underworld is not dissimilar to corporate America. Dominik doesn't believe in understated or subtlety but Killing them Softly is an entertaining ride nonetheless. One cannot help ponder whether this film was destined for something much, much more."
Inside Out,2011,4.5,"A man is released from prison after serving a long time for killing a man who tried to kill his best friend. Once out, he just wants to live a normal life, but his best friend immediately gets him into a new heap of serious troubles.","Not a bad film despite some hard to digest aspects; for one, the best friend of the con marries the latter's girlfriend after he is imprisoned. One can see her attraction for him, but he is such a nerd and contrast to her manly boyfriend, hard to believe she would marry him however distraught she was over husband's imprisonment. Levesque was pretty good as an actor and Rappaport,too, given his difficult role, if a bit over nerdy. Too many plot reversals,in my opinion, but the dialogue, humorous at times, kept your interest. The director did a good job in his first film, considering the script he was given. If the film was hard to believe in parts, it kept your interest; the plot intricacies made you want to see how the ball of wax would be resolved. Best thing about the picture might be its title."
Hop,2011,5.4,"E.B., the Easter Bunny's teenage son, heads to Hollywood, determined to become a drummer in a rock 'n' roll band. In LA, he's taken in by Fred after the out-of-work slacker hits E.B. with his car.","The TV previews made me want to see this movie, but it turns out that those were the few funny moments to this movie - with the exception of the school play with the characters singing ""I Want Candy"". Nicely animated, but short on guffaws. Kids may love it, but as an adult it was a bit boring at moments and not very original. Now, really, the Easter Bunny has a sleigh? May be best to wait for this one to come out on DVD and keep it in mind for an Easter basket gift for next year. There are a shortage of good, original movie plots out there, short on story line and imagination. If the producers could only make the perfect fit of beautiful animation and storyline, you'd have one fine movie. This one needed more laughs to keep it moving along."
Rango,2011,7.3,"Rango is an ordinary chameleon who accidentally winds up in the town of Dirt, a lawless outpost in the Wild West in desperate need of a new sheriff.","We all face an existential crisis at some time or another, just usually not when we're seven, which will likely be the mean age of children watching this newest non-Pixar non- DreamWorks animated feature. No, ""Rango"" won't challenge kids to contemplate their role in the cosmos, but that's precisely the predicament of its main character, a theatrical lizard who finds himself ‚Äî as many animals in animated films do these days ‚Äî thrust out of domestic bliss and forced to reckon with the untamed and unforgiving nature of the wild natural world. But in addition to all its verboseness and abstract homage to classic Westerns, ""Rango"" equally dishes out top-notch physical humor and creative characters for the young ones to lap up, even if they're not exactly of age to, as the film puts at least once, ""ruminate.""We don't learn much about Rango's life as a pet lizard. In fact, his name is not even Rango; he adopts it as his identity during his adventure. We do see him create his own theatre productions with the random items in his tank and he pretends that they give him feedback and criticism. When he determines that his latest show needs some intense conflict, he finds himself flung from his tank and on the side of the dry desert road. At the advice of an old armadillo (Molina), he seeks out water and stumbles upon the town of Dirt, a classic Wild West locale full or critters and experiencing a nasty drought.Johnny Depp quickly loses himself into Rango, a character that's somewhere between his take on Willy Wonka and his turn as Hunter S. Thompson. Depp churns out an outstanding animated protagonist, one who is equal parts boisterous and insecure. As the ultimate outsider in Dirt, our lizard hero has an epiphany: he can reinvent himself out here. He takes up his new name and makes up a fantastical tall tale and then with a pinch of luck, becomes the toast of the town and gets anointed sheriff. All seems swell, but something's up in the town with regards to the dwindling water supply and the local critters are getting restless. Rango must truly be the hero he masquerades as.The creatures of Dirt are fascinatingly animated. They are gritty and unpleasant looking, but awing in their detail. Rango's facial expressions even out-Depp the man behind them as embodied in the scrawny asymmetrical lizard. The animators do a particularly fine job of creating the hot and dry climate of the desert, enough so to recommend that the film is best enjoyed with a beverage in hand. It's so effective that it magnifies the problematic nature of this simple predicament done hundreds of times before. Hidden underneath it all somewhere has to be an environmental message, but not an overt one and not the main lesson to learn from the story.The language and texture of the film might be decidedly adult, but the conventions of the story and the degree of action aims specifically for children. Rather than aim for a middle ground, ""Rango"" somehow takes the highest road and the lowest road simultaneously. The dialogue and the situations are sophisticated but the physicality of the characters and the high-flying Western frontier action still plays to a child's understanding. This only proves that ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" director Gore Verbinski has a real gift for all-ages entertainment.In addition to Rango's existential quandary, children will not understand the cinematic homages either, particularly to spaghetti Westerns. One of the film's most affecting scenes comes at the moment when our animated hero, as they all do, hits the lowest of lows after he's exposed as a ""fraud."" Rango has a run-in with ""The Spirit of the West,"" an instantly recognizable figure who has some old-fashioned advice about toughness and walking tall on the path you're given. It's a tender moment as what has been considered a bygone era of cinema plays an important thematic role in such a modern mainstream story.""Rango"" doesn't quite capture the degree of humor and emotional depth that the Pixar greats of the last few years have, but it's a fun adventure with exquisite animation, tasteful characters and a good heart, which puts it as an above-average offering compared to others of its kind. Adults will simply marvel at the intellectual boldness of this pure and simple kids movie and rightfully so. Only with a Pixar gold standard in place does ""Rango"" come across as flawed; otherwise it's an absolutely pleasant watch from start to finish.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"
Blitz,2011,6.1,A tough cop is dispatched to take down a serial killer who has been targeting police officers.,I had not heard anything about this movie before I watched it. Overall this film is a pleasant surprise. Jason Statham is good playing a similar type of role he has played before. The script is unique and is interesting the entire way. I would recommend this film.
"Dieu est grand, je suis toute petite",2001,5.2,"Mich√®le, 20 years old, feels terrible after having broken up with her boyfriend. She meets Francois, who's a veterinarian and Jewish. Mich√®le decides to convert to Judaism because she has to believe in something, if not in someone.","Audrey Tatou, for certain France's most charismatically engaging young actress today, made ""God is Great, I'm Not"" before ""Amelie"" projected her to international acclaim.  This release, coming quietly after the famous film, has had little if any U.S. theater exposure but it's a DVD that cries out for word-of-mouth boosterism.Tatou plays Michele, a self-proclaimed ""top model"" (well she clearly does have a successful career going).  More to the point she a 100% certifiable flake who flits from religion to religion seeking wisdom and, perhaps, a sense of belonging.After a party she meets veterinarian Francois (Edouard Baer).  A very short acquaintanceship leads to a one-night stand ending in a dashed ambulance run to the hospital because Michele has OD'd.  Attempted suicide?  A mistake? It's a mystery but Michele's closest friend, Valerie the Novice Therapist (Julie Depardieu), convinces Francois he has some continuing responsibility for Michele.  Just because of one night of hot sex?  Well, it is France and the idea has a certain charm.  Anyway, without it the film would end at this point.  Francois has a quiet accommodating quality: he's the kind that a Michele will always enrapture.Michele falls in love with Francois, a fellow comfortable as a ""secular Jew.""  In his case that means he doesn't even want his apartment house neighbors to know his heritage.  Absurd, declaims Michele, who proceeds to noisily attempt to affix a ""mezuzah"" to his front door (a Jewish talismanic article that observant members of that religion invariably have at each door in their homes sans the bathroom).Anyway, the real fun is that Michele, bored with her past religious explorations, decides to study Judaism both with a rabbi and also in a class for possible converts - but only with Francois safely sitting beside her and actively participating.  He IS besotted!There's a lot of good humor as Francois allows himself to be drawn into Judaism - but only so far.  Meanwhile Michele gets more serious about not only studying the religion but observing its very restrictive dietary precepts and other controlling laws.So much for the basic plot-anything more would spoil the fun.  But director Pascale Bailly has insured that no viewer need be Jewish to enjoy madcap Tatou's foray into that ancient religion.Tatou has the most marvelous ability to instantly telegraph her feelings through economical but mesmerizing facial expressions.  Born a century earlier, she would have been a silent film star to rival the Gish sisters, Pola Negri and many others.She's the treat who makes this offbeat comedy (with a dollop of serious relationship issues) worth watching.So rent it!8/10"
The Iron Lady,2011,6.4,"An elderly Margaret Thatcher talks to the imagined presence of her recently deceased husband as she struggles to come to terms with his death while scenes from her past life, from girlhood to British prime minister, intervene.","This film's strength lies in the acting by Meryl Streep. She breathes life into the persona of Margaret Thatcher and makes her feel like an authentic person rather than a caricature (whether positive or negative). However, the film has no other strengths. The story is completely unfocused and there is no overall point or theme to the random events."
Back to the Future,1985,8.5,"Marty McFly, a 17-year-old high school student, is accidentally sent 30 years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean invented by his close friend, the maverick scientist Doc Brown.","Reviewers say 'Back to the Future' is acclaimed for its inventive time-travel plot, blending comedy, adventure, and romance. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd's performances and chemistry are celebrated. The nostalgic depiction of the 1950s and 1980s, along with cultural references, resonates deeply. Special effects, especially the DeLorean, are praised for their ingenuity. Themes of family, self-discovery, and consequences are noted for their depth. Its enduring appeal and cultural impact are frequently highlighted."
Contraband,2012,6.4,"To protect his brother-in-law from a drug lord, a former smuggler heads to Panama to score millions of dollars in counterfeit bills.","Directing 6/10- Some unique and intriguing shots, but nothing too rememberable Acting 8.5/10- The acting is the category that without a doubt, stole the show. Solid efforts from the entire cast but the film really benefited from tremendous performances from Ribisi and Landry Jones. Screenplay 4/10- The screenplay is fun no doubt and benefits from decent pacing and a few intense action sequences but the film lacks originality, stealing concepts and at times, lines. Visual effects 5/10- The visual effects were average. I can't completely fault a film for not using unnecessary visuals. Sound effects/Music 5/10- The sound effects were fine, nothing misplaced there. The music was again just OK, sometimes the music was great and mixed well with the action going on but in some the haunting/emotional scenes the music didn't make the scene 'better', which is what it should do. Overall, the film is just another forgettable action film. The film has decent enough story (though clich√©), with great acting and some fun action sequences that make the film at least worth a viewing."
The Shining,1980,8.4,"A family heads to an isolated hotel for the winter, where a sinister presence influences the father into violence. At the same time, his psychic son sees horrifying forebodings from both the past and the future.","Reviewers say 'The Shining' is lauded for its atmospheric tension, innovative camera work, and Jack Nicholson's performance. Kubrick's direction and psychological horror elements are often highlighted. Criticisms include deviations from the novel, underdeveloped characters, and perceived lack of coherence. Shelley Duvall's performance divides opinions. Pacing and length are contentious, with some finding it slow and others appreciating the build-up. Despite mixed views, it remains influential in horror."
Das Leben der Anderen,2006,8.4,"In 1984 East Berlin, an agent of the secret police conducting surveillance on a writer and his lover finds himself becoming increasingly absorbed by their lives.","Reviewers say 'The Lives of Others' is acclaimed for its intense depiction of life under Stasi surveillance in East Germany, highlighting themes of privacy and power abuse. Ulrich M√ºhe's performance as the conflicted officer is outstanding, and the film's pacing and tension are masterful. Critics value its deep exploration of humanity and ethics. However, some find it slow, with predictable twists, and critique its Hollywood-like approach. Despite this, it is widely seen as powerful and thought-provoking."
Le fabuleux destin d'Am√©lie Poulain,2001,8.3,"Despite being caught in her imaginative world, young waitress Amelie decides to help people find happiness. Her quest to spread joy leads her on a journey during which she finds true love.","Reviewers say 'Amelie' is celebrated for its whimsical charm, imaginative storytelling, and Audrey Tautou's captivating performance. The film's unique visual style, vibrant cinematography, and enchanting soundtrack are frequently praised. Many highlight its heartwarming themes of kindness, love, and self-discovery, deeming it a timeless classic. However, some critics find it overly sentimental or lacking in substantial plot. Despite mixed opinions, 'Amelie' remains beloved for its artistic expression and emotional resonance."
The Green Mile,1999,8.6,A death row guard learns that a gentle giant in his charge possesses a mysterious gift.,"Reviewers say 'The Green Mile' is acclaimed for its compelling narrative, standout performances by Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan, and deep emotional resonance. It explores themes of justice, compassion, and the supernatural, though some find its pacing, length, and genre blend problematic. The film's character portrayals and handling of the death penalty elicit mixed reactions, with critiques of sentimentality and clich√©s. Nevertheless, its powerful story and unforgettable characters often earn high praise."
The Prestige,2006,8.5,Rival 19th-century magicians engage in a bitter battle for trade secrets.,"Reviewers say 'The Prestige' is acclaimed for its intricate storytelling, strong performances, and deep themes of obsession and rivalry. The complex plot and surprising twists are celebrated, though some find the supernatural elements unrealistic. The film's ending is divisive, with mixed reactions. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman's performances are consistently praised, yet certain accents and dialogue delivery pose challenges for some viewers. Visually stunning, 'The Prestige' is intellectually engaging but polarizes audiences with its unconventional twists and thematic decisions."
A Separation,2011,8.3,A married couple are faced with a difficult decision - to improve the life of their child by moving to another country or to stay in Iran and look after a deteriorating parent who has Alzheimer's disease.,"Reviewers say 'A Separation' delves into family, duty, societal expectations, and complex human relationships, exploring moral dilemmas, class distinctions, and cultural norms. It portrays intense emotions like tension, frustration, love, and betrayal through realistic interactions. The narrative is lauded for its complexity, presenting ambiguous moral questions without clear 'good' or 'bad' characters. The film is frequently praised for evoking deep emotional responses and provoking thought on universal human experiences."
Requiem for a Dream,2000,8.3,The drug-induced utopias of four Coney Island people are shattered when their addictions run deep.,"Reviewers say 'Requiem for a Dream' is a powerful film exploring drug addiction's harsh realities. Burstyn, Leto, Connelly, and Wayans deliver compelling performances. Aronofsky's direction, with split-screen shots and rapid editing, is innovative yet divisive. The haunting score and cinematography enhance emotional impact, though some find the stylization excessive. Despite mixed views on its approach, the film is noted for its strong emotional reactions and unflinching portrayal of addiction's consequences."
Reservoir Dogs,1992,8.3,"When a simple jewelry heist goes horribly wrong, the surviving criminals begin to suspect that one of them is a police informant.","Reviewers say 'Reservoir Dogs' is acclaimed for its sharp dialogue, non-linear narrative, and unique characters. It delves into loyalty, betrayal, and moral ambiguity in the criminal world. Known for its graphic violence and pop culture references, the film's eclectic soundtrack enhances its atmosphere. Critics laud the ensemble cast, especially Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth. Its controversial elements have polarized audiences, yet it remains influential in independent cinema."
Bakkermann,2008,3.5,,
A Clockwork Orange,1971,8.2,Alex DeLarge and his droogs barbarize a decaying near-future.,"Reviewers say 'A Clockwork Orange' is a provocative film by Stanley Kubrick, delving into free will, government control, and violence. It is lauded for its striking visuals, classical music integration, and Malcolm McDowell's performance. Critics appreciate its philosophical inquiry into conditioning and morality, though some find its graphic content unsettling. The film's Nadsat language and futuristic setting enhance its unique atmosphere. Despite varied opinions on its merit, 'A Clockwork Orange' is recognized as a significant cinematic work."
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,2004,8.3,"When their relationship turns sour, a couple undergoes a medical procedure to have each other erased from their memories forever.","Reviewers say 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' delves into love, memory, and human connection, exploring the complexities and pain of relationships. It questions erasing painful memories and emphasizes the resilience of the human spirit. The film highlights the importance of cherishing memories, even painful ones, through its unique narrative and surreal visuals, prompting reflection on love and memory's impact."
Gran Torino,2008,8.1,"After a Hmong teenager tries to steal his prized 1972 Gran Torino, a disgruntled, prejudiced Korean War veteran seeks to redeem both the boy and himself.","Reviewers say 'Gran Torino' is a poignant drama examining redemption, cultural conflict, and human connections. Clint Eastwood's portrayal of Walt Kowalski, a prejudiced veteran, is lauded for its emotional depth. The film tackles racism, xenophobia, and redemption, showcasing human complexity and change. Critics praise Eastwood's direction and the supporting cast's authenticity, though some note minor flaws like clich√©d characters.

Scarface,1983,8.3,"In the 1980s, a determined criminal-minded Cuban immigrant becomes the biggest drug smuggler in Miami, and is eventually undone by his own drug addiction.","Reviewers say 'Scarface' receives mixed reactions, with many praising Al Pacino's portrayal of Tony Montana, a Cuban immigrant navigating Miami's drug underworld. The film's style, violence, and Pacino's intense performance are commended. However, some find it overly long, excessively violent, and lacking depth. Themes of greed, power, and the American Dream resonate with certain viewers, while others see it as shallow. Despite its flaws, 'Scarface' is celebrated for its cultural impact and iconic status in gangster cinema."
The Great Gatsby,2013,7.2,"A writer and wall street trader, Nick Carraway, finds himself drawn to the past and lifestyle of his mysterious millionaire neighbor, Jay Gatsby, amid the riotous parties of the Jazz Age.","Whoever decided that blaring modern pop/ hip hop music into a story of the early 20's was a good idea needs their heads examined. It not only removes you completely from the story but jolts you so far out of it that you need a few minutes to try and refocus yourself back into the story. (and that's not a knock on this genre of music, it just has no place here..)After an hour, I could stand no more, the acting and story seemed great, but the soundtrack was too much to take.So much great music was made during this time period that if used effectively could have elevated this story. Such a waste."
The Bourne Ultimatum,2007,8.0,Jason Bourne dodges a ruthless C.I.A. official and his Agents from a new assassination program while searching for the origins of his life as a trained killer.,"The Bourne Ultimatum is the third and final outing for super-spy Jason Bourne, a man who is out to kill the people who made him into a killer. The Bourne series is one of the highest regarded trilogies by critics (Ultimatum has an 85/100 on metacritic.com, meaning it's status is ""universal acclaim) and for good reason- the fighting is choreographed very well and the deep story can be very engrossing.First, I highly advise you watch The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, the two fancy-titled prequels to Ultimatum. There may be three different movies, but in reality they are all a continuance of one another: missing one leaves you stranded and confused, just like I was. You will still be about to enjoy the action and fight scenes of Ultimatum if you missed the first two, but then the story will definitely lead to some confusion.If you were lucky enough to view the prequels to this movie, you probably had a treat watching Bourne take down his enemies and track down the man who screwed him from Supremacy. Jason Bourne is played very well by Matt¬ÖDamon. Damon does nothing to deserve an Oscar nod, but his work here is good enough to hold it's own. Bourne's adventures take place in many different cities; the cities are all varied enough to keep the movie from becoming bland at times. The agency tracking Bourne takes advantage of every technological tool known to mankind to track him down.I won't go into detail on the characters because they are continuations off of the first two movies. However, it wouldn't hurt the movie to spell a few things out for the audience- not every viewer is a die-hard movie watcher who can pick up on every little hint about story development. Ultimatum wouldn't have been harmed at all if the story was a little more up front.It seems most people agree that Ultimatum was a success of a film: the movie opened to $69 million, and -box office total now is up to $216 mil- is currently still going very strongly for a movie that has been in theatres since August 3. It's the best action movie I've seen since Live Free or Die Hard.Good) Damon is solid but not spectacular, very smart movie Bad) Story is like many others"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,2011,8.1,"As the battle between the forces of good and evil in the wizarding world escalates, Harry Potter draws ever closer to his final confrontation with Voldemort.","Reviewers say 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2' concludes the series with mixed reactions. Many praise the film for its thrilling action, special effects, and Alan Rickman's Snape. However, criticisms include deviations from the book, rushed pacing, and omitted scenes. Fans express disappointment over altered plot points and lack of emotional depth, feeling key moments and relationships were underdeveloped. Despite issues, the film is commended for its visual spectacle and series closure."
Assault on Precinct 13,2005,6.3,"A police sergeant must rally the cops and prisoners together to protect themselves on New Year's Eve, just as corrupt policeman surround the station with the intent of killing all to keep their deception in the ranks.","I saw this remake last night and must say that it was an extremely enjoyable two hours right from the get-go. The opening of the story is one of the best I've seen in years, and throughout the acting is solid which wasn't surprising with this cast, but the dialogue was great all the way through, which you don't usually get in films anymore, and the action and building of tension was done very well by the director, his choreographers, and the composers. Top notch performance from Ethan Hawke, Laurence Fishburne, John Leguizamo, and Brian Dennehy. Very solid leading lady turn for Drea DeMatteo, as well as from Maria Bello. And the casting of Gabriel Bryne as the villain is genius although I would have liked to have seen him do a bit more on screen with Hawke and Fishburne. Overall, a solid 9 out of 10 for giving me some things in a film that I'll remember simply because there unexpected and done really well. Go see this film if you like good action filled thrillers, I promise as a filmmaker myself, it won't disappoint."
Warm Bodies,2013,6.8,"After a highly unusual zombie saves a still-living girl from an attack, the two form a relationship that sets in motion events that might transform the entire lifeless world.","R (Nicholas Hoult) is a zombie, but he's trying to remember his human life. He's barely about to grunt a word out, and he has a friend (Rob Corddry) sort of. While hunting, R runs into human Julie. He falls for the girl, and saves her from the zombie pack.There are a lot of zombie movies out there. I mean aaaalottttt. So it's not surprising that people are trying to explore a more expansive zombie universe. Zombies are faster, slower, funnier, and parodied. Now zombies are falling in love.It's something new. I wouldn't say it's funny. It's not. It is curious, and somewhat sweet. Nicholas Hoult is a good emo zombie. The difficulty lies with the grunting halting speech. It makes the dialog hard to listen to. This makes the interior narration absolutely vital. It was probably important to try even more internal dialog.As for Teresa Palmer, I'm not sure she's star material. She's a really pretty girl. I really like her, but I still see her as the girlfriend character. The other girl in the movie is Analeigh Tipton. She might be marginally better as the lead. She seems to have a little more comedic skills.I am very happy that people aren't just doing the same old zombie movie over and over again. This story had obvious obstacles. I think it overcame most of them relatively well."
War Horse,2011,7.2,A young farm boy enlists to serve in World War I after his beloved horse is sold to the cavalry. His hopeful journey takes him out of England and onto the front lines as the war rages on.,"It is well understood from the first few scenes that the typical clich√© of both war films and animal dramas will stain Spielberg's canvas, yet the film pushes forward, earning well-deserved praise. Quite a few scenes are captivating to say the least; as is the scene with the horse, Joey, forging through heavily barb-wired no man's land.'War Horse' surely reminisces the older WW1 films, and epic war films in general, such as Lawrence of Arabia, that drag on forever, yet do not fail to keep you enthralled with their stunning visuals and top-notch acting. Jeremy Irvine's performance was acceptable for an actor fairly new to the game, as were the performances of the gamut of child actors in the film, but honorable mentions must go to Emily Watson, Niels Arestrup, and Peter Mullan. The production did a wonderful job to give the horse Joey a deeper personified image, as if he were an actor. The same goes for the other horses in the film, who seem to converse amongst each other and reveal a chemistry shared between animal and animal, as well as animal and man. A wonderful job on the whole. Certainly Spielberg's finest work in recent months (yes, I don't think cowboys and aliens should ever mix).For what its worth, this picture will move you deeply, as it has done to many. 'War Horse' inspires anti-war sentiments, as Joey's endeavors help him sympathize with men on both sides of the trenches, and ultimately reminds us of the beauty of Earths beasts. Each one has its own character that strikes a chord with the audience, and this is undeniable.Enjoy!"
The Impossible,2012,7.5,The story of a tourist family in Thailand caught in the destruction and chaotic aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.,"At first I did not think this movie was something I would like to see. I felt it would be one of those movies that once the disaster happened it would become dis-interesting and would be boring the second half of the movie. I am very happy I had the opportunity to see it. The only reason I did not give it a 10 was I thought the character build up was a little shallow. I would have liked to get know the family a little better before the disaster. Other than that I feel that the movie was fantastic. Once the inevitable happened the film kept my interest and was very compelling throughout. The special effects were realistic and not over done. I wish foreign movies like this would make a bigger release in the United States to show Hollywood how to make a movie especially a true story movie. I felt when I was watching this film that I was seeing it actually happening with no to very little exaggerations. That is where I feel Hollywood falls short and puts allot of drama in a film that really did not occur in the true event. If there were exaggerations in this movie they were seamless and not over done. If you have a chance to see this movie I feel it is ""a must see movie"" you will not be disappointed."
Lawless,2012,7.2,"Set in Depression-era Franklin County, Virginia, a trio of bootlegging brothers are threatened by a new special deputy and other authorities angling for a cut of their profits.","Lawless is the story of the three Bondurant brothers from Franklin County, Virginia, Tom Hardy, Jason Clarke, and the runt of the litter Shia LaBoeuf. Before World War I the Bondurants made a good living selling moonshine, but now Prohibition has arrived and there are new problems on the horizon for those in that business.One of the most colossal pieces of stupidity that America ever indulged in was Prohibition. We actually amended our constitution so that we could regulate morals. A good lesson for those who think regulation of one's personal behavior is a desired thing. What the Bondurants have to deal with is law enforcement which is in the form of a corrupt District Attorney Tim Tolin.An idea like Prohibition is sure to bring out the corruption in many who see it as a way to take bribes. Tolin is one of those and he has a special deputy in Guy Pearce ready to enforce the law and those who don't bribe. That would be the Bondurants and we have the makings of an old fashioned mountain feud brewing.LaBoeuf has a lot of trouble living up to the legend his brothers have created. In fact his weakness is the cause of a lot of problems. But when a young mountain kid Dane DeHaan is murdered by Pearce that gets a war started.Both LaBoeuf and Pearce deliver some standout performances in Lawless. This is based on a novelization of some real incidents by a descendant of the Bondurant family. The recreation of Prohbition era rural Virginia is well done. Definitely worth a look."
Walk the Line,2005,7.8,"A chronicle of country music legend Johnny Cash's life, from his early days on an Arkansas cotton farm to his rise to fame with Sun Records in Memphis, where he recorded alongside Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Carl Perkins.","Whenever I see so much ""Oscar worthy"" tags/blurbs in an ad campaign I get nervous, see Cinderella Man. Usually you look closely at the fine print and see that the esteemed critic lauding the film is Joe Schmoe from the One Stop Light Bugle Press in Buttcreek, Illinois or a low level flunky who just happens to work for the media conglomerate that is distributing the film. So my heart sank a little when a film I have been eagerly awaiting was swaddled with such praise when the ads hit the air.But they're right for once.Joaquin Phoenix wears Johnny Cash like a suit. He isn't doing a Rich Little impersonation, you don't rub your eyes in disbelief, but he channels a man so distinct in appearance and voice to a level that is beyond admirable. One of the traits that made Johnny Cash a legend was that nobody sounded or looked like him. Short of a computer generated Cash walking around in his own bio-pic like one of those John Wayne beer commercials this is the definitive representation.And yet Phoenix may not give the best performance in the film.Reese Witherspoon more than holds up her end in a role that easily could have been reduced to a clich√©d bumpkin. Witherspoon portrays the on-stage June in the way June portrayed her own ""character"", the stage persona that people adored, while giving her the resolve and inner strength to be the woman who tamed a hell-bent, grizzly bear of a man like John.The chemistry of Phoenix and Witherspoon together in any scene, but their on-stage duets in particular, are truthful in a way that resonates long after the credits. I know that unless you have been living in a cave for the past week you have likely been bombarded with the word that the actors sing themselves without use of lip syncing. I have never been a fan of musicals, or even musical performances in a film. They generally seem forced and uncomfortable to me, the moment when I stop experiencing the story and feel reminded that I am watching a movie. I never felt that in this film. I never felt that their singing took the focus of the film, but the performances work with the story like no other music bio I have ever seen. I never felt as if I was being led through the catalog, the songs felt as organic and natural as any spoken dialog in a great narrative.This film far exceeded my expectations and afforded me the first trip home from a theater with a true feeling of satisfaction in a very, very long time. Highly recommended."
La Vie En Rose,2007,7.5,"Biopic of the iconic French singer √âdith Piaf. Raised by her grandmother in a brothel, she was discovered while singing on a street corner at the age of 19. Despite her success, Piaf's life was filled with tragedy.","It is difficult to overstate the necessary calibre of a woman who was raised in a filthy whorehouse, sung and slept on the street, travelled with the circus, lost her child at 20, went blind for a time, was wrongly accused of murder, struggled with a drug addiction and lost other loved ones by the bucketload in her life, and still got up on stage at the end of her life to sing ""Je ne regrette rien"". La M√¥me documents each stage of Edith Piaf's life with creative direction and an intense performance by its lead actress, Martion Cotillard.Ultimately it is a film that curiously enough does not come down to acting or story so much as it owes everything to its direction by Olivier Dahan. Audiences have been divided thus far on his efforts as they are somewhat unorthodox, but I believe he has truly done something magical with what could have fallen prey to a by-the-numbers biopic approach. In La M√¥me, the continuity is clipped and fragmentary at several points in the film, with scene 2 melting into scene 1 as opposed to vice versa. The story of Edith seems to fledge itself around two or three story lines simultaneously ¬ñ her youth, her adulthood and her last days.Marion Cotillard, a personal favourite of mine, is perfect at each of the aforementioned stages, having met the wonders of realistic make-up but also clearly having connected with the character of Edith Piaf. As a young singer she is fumbling and bird-like, but always with raw intensity behind her performance. As an old lady (although from what I understand she was never truly that old at the time of her death) she has transformed into something else ¬ñ a kind of loud, hysterical diva who is alternatively self-depreciative and overbearing, her youthful humility having been quenched by years of alcohol abuse and her bird-like body and gait having been crippled by rheumatism. Only once does Cotillard vaguely emerge from her character, and it is toward the end when Edith is sitting on a beach in California giving an interview. The rest of the film she is wholly chameleon-like and indistinguishable from la m√¥me.Certainly this type of tragicomic drama with all of its poverty-stricken episodes and heart-rending tragedies is primed to elicit an emotional response, but Dahan goes the extra mile in polishing the story for audiences. It truly is a beautiful work of art, coated with sweeping tracking shots √° la Paul Thomas Anderson or Martin Scorsese blended with shakycam to capture the fast, fickle pace of the business, endlessly creative intercutting of continuity and breathtaking scenes after another. When Piaf's beautiful hands have been noted, a muted performance is given in which the camera only focuses on her theatrics and hand gestures. Yet the best scene takes place in Piaf's apartment some 2/3s into the film in which she is waiting for her lover Marcel to fly in from Morocco. I shall give no spoilers. The film is momentarily gray and depressing, only to jerk the audience away from the misery and lose itself in a blossom-strewn pictorial style whenever Piaf goes on stage.La M√¥me is a one-woman-show in all respects, with Cotillard shamelessly relegating every other cast member to the background with her emotional intensity. But in all fairness supporting characters are not given much screen time in the film, seemingly floating away from the central story eventually, or dying in some tragedy, illustrating the lonely life of its titular singer. La M√¥me needs to be seen to be believed, for it unexpectedly floors all other musical biopics of recent years ¬ñ or indeed ever.9 out of 10"
Couples Retreat,2009,5.6,"A comedy centered around four couples who settle into a tropical-island resort for a vacation. While one of the couples is there to work on the marriage, the others fail to realize that participation in the resort's therapy sessions is not optional.","Average comedy with good actors, without anything special about it. You can literally tell the story of the movie just from the name or the cover. But it's still enjoyable without any special expectations."
The Watch,2012,5.7,Four men who form a neighborhood watch group as a way to get out of their day-to-day family routines find themselves defending the Earth from an alien invasion.,"I see a lot of people bashing this film for some reason. Sure it's not some cinematic masterpiece; when I went to see it I wasn't expecting that. ""The Watch"" is a funny buddy comedy, filled with crude jokes and the silly shenanigans that you'd expect from Stiller, Vaughn, the rest of the cast, and writer Seth Rogen. Like a delicious onion the film does a good job peeling away at the story. Yes, it is not hard see the plot coming, but it's how the characters deal with the situations they encounter, that makes the film entertaining. Crybaby critics with their stuck up trendy smugness, ""See, told you the plot was predictable.."" Wow, way to over dramatize the obvious, you're so clever. I bet that ""Titanic"" ending took you by surprise? For all those critics who whine and cry about ""The Watch"" maybe they should just stay home and watch one of their Disney classics on VHS. This is a great film to see, escape the chaotic world and have a few laughs."
Accepted,2006,6.4,"A high school slacker who's rejected by every school he applies to opts to create his own institution of higher learning, the South Harmon Institute of Technology, on a rundown piece of property near his hometown.","I don't think I've yet seen a movie in my whole lifetime about a high school kid creating his own college, just to impress his parents. Nowadays, movies are either remakes or sequels, or plots that have been used in many different films. This one has an original story line and to follow it up by making it a comedy films only lightens the deal. With this well thought out story and with laughs mixed in, this is a good movie. Now I've seen better, but upon going into the theater I was thinking another drug/beer/frat party with some sexual innuendo tossed in (aka an ""American Pie"" flick) but I was surprised. To sum it up, I enjoyed the film and the next time your shuffling through the paper for movies, look for show times to ""Accepted"". If you want to laugh out loud, that is."
Hannibal Rising,2007,6.1,Trauma and tragedy during World War II warp young Hannibal Lecter's mind.,"I don't put this in the same category
as the 3 previous films with Hopkins
(counting Manhunter out completely,,
even though it is a very good film). This movie is another animal altogether. Not
only bc this has a young actor playing a young Lecter,, but bc this is the origin story,, how he became the monster. This movie shows so many new sides to the character. A helpless child,, a traumatized teen,, a deranged young man trying to put his memories together to exact his revenge,,, and also, love. His love for the sister he lost, and also his widowed aunt.If you are a fan of the Hopkins trilogy,, then you must see this,,,"
Hard Target,1993,6.2,"A woman hires a drifter as her guide through New Orleans in search of her missing father. In the process, they discover a deadly game of cat and mouse behind his disappearance.","Now I'm a fan of all Woo films; even the worst of his works, such as ""Broken Arrow"", are at least 'standard fare' in Hollywood-terms; this, however, does not apply to the few sad TV-attempts he made (The ""Once a thief""-cable flick is just dreadful...). ""Face/Off"" and even the 'funny' ""M:I-2"" are both action-packed showdowns which demonstrate well what Woo can do. But his first Hollywood-attempt still remains the best of them- at least, to date! ""Hard target"" was shoot with very little time and then re-edited 7 times (count'em- seven!) to finally pass the censorship (yes, I'd call it that!) and STILL, after assumably at least half (?) the flavour taken out, it's still one tough cookie! Maybe frustrated at the censorship, Woo has later on stayed on the safe R-rated waters in Hollywood, not even trying to top himself (And again, STILL remaining the best bet when it comes to directing some serious action!)""Hard Target"" puts Jean-Claude Van 'Damage' against one of the always trustworthy screen villains, Lance Henriksen, and his pack of urban-commando (all black outfits, combat vests and MP5's) goons, and that's all you need to know! IF you think the going gets a little boring on the way, wait for the final 20 minutes, which will give you an adrenaline rush worth your while!BTW, if anyone knows where I could get my hands on the 116-minutes (any shorter will not do!) uncut ""Director's cut"", I'd be happy to buy a copy, preferably DVD (but also VHS will do; we're talking cult classic here!)"
Hall Pass,2011,5.9,"Rick and Fred, two husbands who are having difficulty in their marriages, are given a Hall Pass by their wives: for one week, they can do whatever they want.","In the world of movies, one of the most endearing genres is that of the goofy comedy - provided it's funny. Unfortunately, this movie does not quite measure up, although it does make an effort. The problem is the story itself. The premise is not funny. Neither are the characters. The two main characters are not funny at all. Their wives are not funny either. The directors even inject some explicit sexual material in an attempt to prop up the movie and it's embarrassing. When one considers the great comedy teams, their characters were fundamentally innocent. Their movies didn't need crude sexual props. Hence, when such props are introduced, that means the movie is in trouble and although the directors try to present an entertaining product, ultimately the final product is such that it generates a feeling of relief when it's finally over."
Dr. No,1962,7.2,A resourceful British government agent seeks answers in a case involving the disappearance of a colleague and the disruption of the American space program.,"No matter whether or not you like this film in the end...if you don't get some feeling of joy the first time Sean Connery says ""Bond. James Bond."" at the card table, I feel sorry for you.This Bond film has a lot less stuff going in it than most, but for what it's worth, and what it has inspired, it's a classic.People who can't tolerate and appreciate older cinema from the 60's might laugh at the action scenes, set and costume design of the movie, but if one considers the year in which this was made, it's all rather exquisite. The film is also full of things that would be considered politically incorrect, and the way Bond and Moneypenny flirt in the office would ensue mass sexual harassment lawsuits in this day and age.The film has an underused villain in Dr. No. Joseph Wiseman sets the standard on how Bond villains, and the majority of how other movie villains, act. One of the things that I love about Bond films is that you will see things that you will never see in other movies. I mean where else but a Bond film would a half Chinese, half German man with metal hands and a compulsive paranoia about radiation, with metal hands live on an island with a ""dragon-mobile""?Dr. No is a definite good start to the Bond series. Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder may only be there for eye candy...but she's great eye candy. Sean Connery is Bond, and pure enjoyment while in this role. So if you are looking for a classic enjoyable movie, this is just what the doctor ordered."
Letters from Iwo Jima,2006,7.8,"The story of the battle of Iwo Jima between the United States and Imperial Japan during World War II, as told from the perspective of the Japanese who fought it.","Don't listen to the people who call this movie inaccurate or revisionist history.The movie is accurate. There were people on both sides of the war who at times showed kindness.Labeling all the Japanese soldiers as people who tortured POWS would be like saying all American soldiers in Vietnam killed and rape innocent Vietnamese. Or all American soldiers in Cuba tortured POWS from the wars in the Middle East. You can't group people together like that.This movie shows better than any other film that there's really no good guys or bad guys when it comes to war. War is just pointless.The movie is not supposed to be a documentary so the people who bash it for little details should go rent a documentary if thats what they want to see.Also, Clint Eastwood deserves major credit for telling both sides of the war. Too many war movies always show the enemy as ""heartless monsters"" when it reality its never like that.This is without a doubt the best movie of the year. Make sure you go see it."
The Italian Job,2003,7.0,"After being betrayed and left for dead in Italy, Charlie Croker and his team plan an elaborate gold heist against their former ally.","Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) assembles a crack team to pull off one last job; a daring heist of a safe which contains $35 million dollars worth of gold bars. However, shortly after the heist has been completed, one of the team turns against the others and escapes with the gold and leaves the remaining members of the team for dead. Following this betrayal, Charlie and his crack team which includes computer genius Lyle (Seth Green), explosives expert Left Ear (Mos Def), and getaway driver Handsome Rob (Jason Statham) set to work in recovering the gold back from the 'rat' in the group with the assistance of safe cracker Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron).I saw the 1969 version of The Italian Job some time ago and remember finding it reasonably enjoyable (although I recall it having a rather bizarre ending). However, I have to admit to possibly enjoying this remake/reboot slightly more....I think the biggest strength of this film lies with the characters and their dialogues; as we're introduced to each character we're given a little bit of background information on each character in order to explain away their relevant 'expertise' but it's done in a way that was both funny and clever. I quite liked the way that each character was set-up in this way. I also felt a great sense of camaraderie between the cast; the whole production was done in a very slick and tongue in cheek manner; I thought the scenes between Green and Statham were the funniest and strongest scenes, but the rest of the cast were all great as well.Another big strength with this film is that it's just so much fun; some heists films have a tendency to become over-plotted and throw in twist after twist. However, with the Italian Job we're just given a straight-forward plot, but yet it's still entertaining enough to keep you interested.The chase sequences are fun, the direction, editing and basically all technical areas are also excellent resulting in a film that's not only fun, but it's also quite a good looking film too.Perhaps having low expectations helped here - I thought the original was a good film rather than a great one so I wasn't expecting much here, but the plot moved along almost as fast as the Minis, the script and the camaraderie between the cast were also top notch and above all else it was fun. Definitely worth watching (especially if you were a fan of the original)."
Step Brothers,2008,6.9,Two aimless middle-aged losers still living at home are forced against their will to become roommates when their parents marry.,"I watched step brothers yesterday for the second time after purchasing it on DVD. For me this is always the tough test when it comes to comedy. I watched it at a packed cinema which as you know in itself can make a film ultimately funny without being so. But i have to say this film still delivered the goods so well.First up this film is STUPID it is ridiculous but it's a comedy with Will Ferrell in it what did you honestly expect?! But my god it's funny it really is hilarious Ferrell and Reilly make an awesome on screen team and the comedy moments just bounce off one an other , each man just helps make the others role as funny as it could have been.It gives you hilarious jokes , stupidly funny scenes , it's one of those comedy's that so so often tries to catch you off guard and every time it absolutely nails it!And underneath all the stupidity bonds are formed , compassion is found and what really matters in life is discovered. You almost feel as if you've learnt a little somethingIt's one of my personal favourite comedy movies and goes up there with some of the greats (Blazing Saddles , Burn After Reading , Superbad , Knocked Up , Anchorman etc.)"
Hart's War,2002,6.4,"A law student becomes a lieutenant during World War II, is captured and asked to defend a black prisoner of war falsely accused of murder.","This film is absorbing because you are kept guessing until the very end. Hart, the lead character, isn't exactly an angel; and the Nazi Kommandant conjures up a measure of sympathy, with other motives of characters such as Col. MacNamara (Willis) truly unclear until the end.Thus, it's enough to keep you watching, although I wish I'd read the book first.  Also, it's not an ""action"" film in the Schwarzenegger sense, but it is fast-paced and holds your attention, as the plot keeps twisting and turning.Contrary to what others thought, I found HART'S WAR to be reasonably historically accurate.  It's frequently pointed out that by late 1944 / early 1945, the Germans were reeling, desperate and disorganized, while HART'S WAR portrays them firmly in control.  This is a fair criticism, but I would respond as follows:1.  HART'S WAR coincides with the Ardennes offensive (Battle of the Bulge), which was the last major German offensive of the war and which came perilously close to succeeding.  Puffed up from that near-victory, not knowing (as we know today) that this was the last gasp of a dying reich and not a turning point towards victory, and now holding hundreds if not thousands of Allied POW's to boot, it's no surprise that the Germans are still confident of victory.2.  Also, HART'S WAR takes place in a short period of time (I would guess 2-3 weeks between Hart's capture and the end of the trial, which itself is only a week).  The story does not drag into the spring of '45, at which point the Germans knew they were losing.3.  The Nazi Kommandant epitomizes this German confidence, yet because he was educated in the US, he has at least a measure of sympathy for his American prisoners and treats them with an equal measure of military courtesy, with a few exceptions.  Other Kommandants during this time may not have been as ""humane,"" but, because of his background, Visser's lack of brutality (again, with exceptions) is understandable.Bruce Willis is clearly a supporting actor in this film, but I felt he had a strong and important role and was, arguably, the CENTRAL character while Colin Farrell is the LEADING character.  However, Willis gets top billing for one simple reason -- TO SELL TICKETS.  It worked for me, at least."
The Rock,1996,7.4,"An FBI chemical weapons expert, and a former SAS solider turned political prisoner, must break into Alcatraz prison when a rogue military group, led by a renegade general, take it over and threaten a nerve gas attack on San Francisco.","The Rock was an awesome film to see in the cinema. Over the top action, amasing driving scenes, an all round enjoyable film. Excellent casting of Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage, interesting idea, ex-military take tour hostage and threaten chemical warfare. But it's all in a days work for the FBI. Scientist risks life and limb to rescue city while pregnant girlfriend looks on. Sean Connery' character is portrayed as a hard ex SAS spy and Nicholas Cage is the mild mannered Scientist/Chemical Expert. Good film, not too taxing on the brain and overall, very enjoyable! A must see for Action Fans."
M√§n som hatar kvinnor,2009,7.8,"Influential industrialist Vanger's niece Harriet disappeared under mysterious circumstances 40 years ago. As a last attempt at solving the case, he hires investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist.","I decided to go all-out and give myself the full Millennium experience by watching the TV miniseries (9 hours in total) over the space of three nights. As a result, these reviews are of the extended, three-hour editions of each film rather than the condensed, theatrical two-hour versions.Wow. I loved it. I'm not a huge fan of the crime genre, and I haven't read the books, but THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is a difficult film to fault. It's a mature and mannered piece of film-making, dealing with adult and taboo themes and wrapping the reader up in a realistic and conscious mystery yarn.Despite the slow pacing, the movie is thoroughly engaging. Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace are both excellent leads, bringing to life fully flesh and blood characters who engage the reader's sympathy and emotions throughout. The thriller aspects of the story are exciting and as a whole this is a mature and fully developed piece of work. Onto the next..."
Harry Potter en de geheime kamer,2002,7.5,"Harry Potter lives his second year at Hogwarts with Ron and Hermione when a message on the wall announces that the legendary Chamber of Secrets has been opened. The trio soon realize that, to save the school, it will take a lot of courage.","Lessons learned since the 1st film! Clearly this film was edited at script stage rather than the cutting room floor stage!! This story reads as film narrative, rather than a book illustration, which was the big mistake of the 1st film. Anyone can watch this film and follow it without knowing the book. The 1st hour is pure laugh out loud fun (the adults in my Cinema audience were shouting with laughter!). The last hour is scary, wand dropping tension.The problem is: how do we convince muggles put-off by the 1st film to go see this one? Why should they give this one a chance? Answer: If you know someone who likes Fun, make them see this film! This film is not about 'Oscars' & Acting, despite the fabulous performances by all the adults, it is about enjoying the overall effect of the film, this being to give the viewer a long lasting buzz. Brilliant! The staging is very theatrical in it's minimalism, yet extravagantly arty in visual specifics. In the not to distant future I see fans going to a regular weekend slot at their local cinema for Audience Participation fun. Wands, swords, sorting hat, spiders, mandrakes & crucial ear muffs as standard props! Lots of gaps for us to shout out funny quips. A Rocky Horror Show Audience Participation Show for kids! Long overdue.My Rating: 8/10. Not a masterpiece of cinematic potential, but such jolly good fun that no one should be denied the joy of a ""Bloody Marvelous"" frolic. A film for the child within us adults. Go see it with a predominantly adult audience if you want to experience the real buzz of unfettered emotion. Only three children were present at the Preview I witnessed and they were silently spellbound whereas the adults evoked emotion noisily throughout and then stood up, cheered and applauded at the end! I shall never forget this truly magical experience.Richard Harris you can not be replaced, you will always be Dumbledore, and hence Omnipresent. Thank you for the fantastic finale to a wonderful life that you gave us. Thank you. And Thank you JK & Chris. You did it, the Chamber is well & truly open now!"
The Game,1997,7.7,A mysterious game invades a man's ordered existence.,"""The Game"" took me on one psychological thrill ride after another loaded with twists and turns scene after scene.Michael Douglas pulled off his best performance as Nicholas Van Orton a man who is approaching his birthday. Upon which he receives an invitation to play a game given to him by his brother Conrad played by Sean Penn. Nicholas reluctantly agrees and soon finds out that the game is more than he bargained for.I thoroughly enjoyed this film because I never knew who was trustworthy or what was going to happen next, this truly was one film that must be seen by those who enjoy never knowing for sure how a movie will turn out.""The Game"" is all Michael Douglas and how well he pulls off his role of being the innocent who happens to be in the middle of a game he can't control. However, a really good movie can not be pulled off by one actor, a whole lot of credit should go to Sean Penn and Deborah Kara Unger for their convincing portrayals in this film."
Dead Poets Society,1989,8.1,"Maverick teacher John Keating returns in 1959 to the prestigious New England boys' boarding school where he was once a star student, using poetry to embolden his pupils to new heights of self-expression.","Reviewers say 'Dead Poets Society' is celebrated for its themes of individuality and nonconformity, with Robin Williams' performance as Mr. Keating receiving widespread acclaim. The film's exploration of traditional education versus creative freedom resonates deeply, though some critics find it relies on clich√©s and sentimentalism. Underdeveloped characters and a predictable plot are noted drawbacks. The handling of serious themes like suicide and the school environment is contentious. Despite criticisms, the film remains influential, inspiring viewers to pursue their passions and think independently."
Harry Potter en de steen der wijzen,2001,7.7,"An orphaned boy enrolls in a school of wizardry, where he learns the truth about himself, his family and the terrible evil that haunts the magical world.","Reviewers say 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is acclaimed for its faithful adaptation, impressive effects, and iconic locations. The film's pacing and young cast performances receive mixed reviews, with some finding them adequate and others noting room for improvement. While groundbreaking, the effects are less impressive compared to later films. Omissions from the book are criticized, yet the movie is seen as a solid series introduction."
The Firm,1993,6.9,A young lawyer joins a prestigious law firm only to discover that it has a sinister dark side.,"When ""The Firm"" came out was - believe it or not - the first time that I had ever heard of Tom Cruise (although I didn't see the movie until several years later). And let me tell you, this was a great introduction. Cruise plays novice lawyer Mitch McDeere, who goes to work for a Memphis firm. With this firm, he has everything that anyone could want. But there's the question: why does everything seem so perfect? The answer lies in the firm's unseemly other side. And they're not just going to let Mitch blow their cover.Sydney Pollack pulled off everything perfectly here. It's sort of like an Ira Levin novel how everything plays out. You may be suspicious of everything after seeing this movie. Above all, it shows that Tom Cruise can actually do a good job when he tries. Also starring Jeanne Tripplehorn, Gene Hackman, Hal Holbrook, Wilford Brimley, Ed Harris, Holly Hunter, David Strathairn and Gary Busey.It's hard to believe that this was the first movie adaptation of a John Grisham novel."
Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle,2004,7.0,A Korean-American office worker and his Indian-American stoner friend embark on a quest to satisfy their desire for White Castle burgers.,"If two chicks sitting in stalls playing 'Battleshits' while the two Indian and Asian 'heroes' hide between them suffering the sounds and smells of scatological low humor sounds funny to you, then you should consider seeing 'Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle.' My last stoner movie, the remake of 'Starsky and Hutch,' was indeed Sunday school by contrast.Director Danny Leiner ('Dude, Where's My Car?') has taken this genre and made a classic, not just because it exploits every possible ethnic stereotype with zeal equaled only by 'Bad Santa's' decimating the Christmas formula. 'Castle' has such fun imitating the roguish good will of the Hope/Crosby road pictures while commenting on the egregious weaknesses of parents and police that almost anyone who doesn't mind a breast or two bared in the name of satire can laugh heartily at modern adult pretensions and youthful indiscretion.Harold and Kumar are trying to find an all-night White Castle after experiencing the sudden yearning that afflicts almost anyone who has had a 'slider' burger. Like that little square of fat and calories, the pot and girls are just too good not to indulge now and then. The two early twenties students, one a serious stock analyst and the other a lazy pre-med genius, are like Hope and Crosby in their witty repartee and canny ability to escape harm. Being delivered from the wrath of seriously deformed 'Freak Show' and his siren wife doesn't deter them from considering the affections of the battling babes or idolizing Neil Patrick Harris in a cameo playing himself as a lethal womanizer.More serious is the multicultural subtext about stereotyping (Asians are nerdy number crunchers and Indians are overachieving medical doctors, for instance) overturned by, for instance, morphing a seemingly 'Joy Luck' club gathering into a raunchy party or exposing a gang of mouthy skinheads as 'girliemen.' It's all pop-cult fun at our own expense, something akin to actually enjoying the articles in 'Playboy' even if they weren't our reason for buying the mags.My grandson Cody and I bonded once again, this time just laughing at the silliness, enjoying the satire, and figuring how we could get his dad to allow his young brother to see it, despite the lurid spots that give spice and lend naughtiness to our increasingly dangerous lives.If stoner comedy has a place in the satire canon, this is one of the best."
Transformers,2007,7.1,"An ancient struggle between two Cybertronian races, the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons, comes to Earth, with a clue to the ultimate power held by a teenager.","This movie is ACTION. I say this first because if you think this movie will be anything more than this, you will be disappointed on some level (as I was). Frame for frame this movie screams Michael Bay.Now that's out of the way, there's a lot of stuff here that works and a lot that doesn't. It's a good thing that the robots do work. Seeing autobots and decepticons in glorious photo-realistic CGI is enough to wring out any childhood fantasy from anybody (not just boys from the 80s). Watching these robots move is to realize a revelation to what is possible with modern movie effects. Whether it's transforming on the move, bashing the living daylights out of each other, or just standing and talking, these guys alone make the movie work. And unlike the other blockbusters that have came out this year, these effects have a sense of weight that adds so much to the visual satisfaction.As for everything else, well... that's when things start to go downhill. In typical epic fashion, this movie contains a sprawling cast. Along with this however, are a large number of writing and acting issues. With such a large number of underdeveloped characters, names are pretty much luxury. Also, most of the human related humor gags miss badly, which makes it hurt more considering a lot of the characters were unnecessary. Jon Voight's Secretary of Defense character completely baffles me, which makes me think that audiences responded positively to the President in Independence Day doing aerial dogfights. Any positives from the supporting cast (including the strange yet entertaining overacting of John Turturro) are outweighed by the large set of negatives.However, the cast has got it where it counts. Shia Lebeouf plays an important part in selling the reality of the robots as the lead character Sam, and also carries an easy likability factor. Megan Fox's acting does a reasonable job bringing some interest to her character to beyond her looks. The voice cast also does an overall superb job. Peter Cullen IS Prime, and although his dialogue does border on the ridiculous, he always has a sense of gravity to his lines. Hugo Weaving also does an equally commendable job as Megatron (His booming entrance will forever be embedded into the minds of little kids everywhere). The rest of the transformers don't say much, which is a shame because I wanted to see so much more interplay between them (The taunts that Optimus and Megatron yell as their fighting is great stuff).Another major gripe I have is Bay's ADD editing. Although it does keep the movie constantly moving, it creates some issues with continuity and distracts from some of the action (probably the biggest crime committed in the movie).I could go on and on about the good things (Bumblebee, Frenzy) and the bad things (Anthony Anderson and his family, forgotten Barricade) and the downright weird things (Dubya's cameo, Sam's friend climbing in a tree). Overall, the film delivers where it really matters. Although I was disappointed, the amount of potential for the sequel (which just got greenlighted) just gets me giddy (is it too much to ask for a tighter script and better acting?)(Also, the Autobot Assemble scene is one of the coolest things I've seen in theaters in years.)"
Parker,2013,6.2,"A thief with a unique code of professional ethics is double-crossed by his crew and left for dead. Assuming a new disguise and forming an unlikely alliance with a woman on the inside, he looks to hijack the score of the crew's latest heist.","Many people say the same things about Jason Statham, He's a typecast or he doesn't do anything different. Which is partly true, but he is good as an action star and in my opinion hes a better actor than what some say. I don't think he does get enough credit seeing how he got into movies almost by accident.Anyways Parker has a good revenge/crime story its about a professional thief who lives by a simple code, don't steal from people who can't afford it and don't hurt people who don't deserve it. After a successful heist our man is left for dead by his partners. The movie has good action throughout. lots of hand to hand combat, and violent ones at that. It also has a better than usual cast and director for a statham action movie (Good villains + hot leading lady).Overall, I got what I was expecting for $10 as a fan of Jason Statham and would recommend it for a good popcorn flick.7/10"
Taken,2008,7.7,"A retired CIA agent travels across Europe and relies on his old skills to save his estranged daughter, who has been kidnapped while on a trip to Paris.","First thing to say is, this is a great and fun movie from beginning to end. If you like the Bourne titles then you will love this movie. The fighting style and the way things get done is similar to Matt Damon's character and it doesn't get old and is interesting and great to watch throughout the whole film.The movie has a similar plot to other action thrillers, but even though you may know the outcome, it is the journey that counts in this movie. It is the way he does what he does, the way that he fights and overcomes problems that draws you into the movie and makes this movie so great to watch.Liam Neeson is such a great cast for the main character, he delivers an outstanding performance. I love to see an actor that can portray themself in anyway, a good guy or a bad guy and in this film he fights for his daughter and he will not stop for anything. You love to watch him seek revenge and feel for him the whole time, maybe just because its Liam Neeson, can you help yourself from loving this guy? He is such a great actor and shows himself as a badass with charm.Great, great , greatness i loved this movie so much and had great fun watching it. If you love the bourne titles you must see this movie. All i can say is its so much fun to watch it, love it and go check it out."
Flyboys,2006,6.5,"The adventures of the Lafayette Escadrille, young Americans who volunteered for the French military before the U.S. entered World War I, and became the country's first fighter pilots.",Do not expect much from the plot as you need not scratch the surface too deeply to experience de'ja vu. (I've seen these plot elements before in just about every war/buddy/love story flick I have ever seen).The acting is decent and the special effects are superb. Do not see this movie with high expectations regarding the plot and you will not be disappointed.The effects wizards took a page from Howard Hughes as there are plenty of clouds in the air combat scenes to lend a feeling of depth and speed. The dog fights are pretty exciting and worth the price of admission to see on the big screen.
Apocalypto,2006,7.8,"As the Mayan kingdom faces its decline, a young man is taken on a perilous journey to a world ruled by fear and oppression.","This film proves that the crazy guy Mel Gibson is a genius of sorts. With Apocalypto, Mel Gibson has proven it's possible to create a compelling action/adventure film in almost any setting. Gibson's theme is that all great civilizations fail when they begin to rot from the inside. Over the next 2 1/4 hours, he provides glimpses into the degeneracy of the Mayan society on the eve of its encounter with the Spanish conquistadores. However, Apocalypto is not a political tract or a dissertation about why the Mayan age came to an end. Instead, it's a high-octane adventure that concludes with one of the most intense extended chase sequences in recent movie history."
Half Nelson,2006,7.1,An inner-city junior high school teacher with a drug habit forms an unlikely friendship with one of his students after she discovers his secret.,"Ryan Gosling is truly amazing in his film role deliveries. His breakthrough role in ""The Believer"" 2001 was explosively intense. He consistently gives integral reflective portrayals, even for a departure romantic role in director Nick Cassavetes' ""The Notebook"" 2004, he was absolutely convincing as Noah who loves Rachel McAdam's Allie to the core. Here in ""Half Nelson,"" he appears to disappear into Dan Dunne, a high school teacher with an ideal and a crack addiction problem. That sure sounds contradictory in terms: a teacher being a role model, while drug addiction a totally unacceptable behavior. As Dunne wrote on the blackboard in the beginning: 'Dialectics,' the film ""Half Nelson"" is in itself dialectics demonstrated.Gosling's Mr. Dunne the history 'teach' doubling also as basketball coach, meeting (a solid matching delivery from) Shareeka Epps' Drey, the 13-year old student who 'found' him and 'witnessed' his secret - theirs is a relationship, naturally portrayed, of two 'opposing' forces as dialectics as can be. I felt Drey is the primary force that 'helped' Dunne's secondary force to yield and together, they created a contradiction anew as life goes on.I remember from a 1969 book, a quote that might describe the heart of ""Half Nelson"": ""Contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life. All things are in themselves contradictory and it is this principle, more than any other, which expresses the essence of things.""In a way, contradictory yet similar: Dunne and Drey both are 'on their own' trying to hang on, to manage the conflicts in their life's journey. Do we need all the answers in life? Do we have to know why someone behave as he/she does or something happen as it did? Director Ryan Fleck and co-writer/editor/producer Anna Boden tried not to 'over-explain anything'. Sometimes the answer can simply be: ""I don't know.""""Half Nelson"" is an ambitious film. Besides 'comments' on educational system, single parent family strife, Dan's addiction predicament, the script also managed to include political viewpoints unobtrusively expressed through talking heads of single student reciting historical civil rights movement events. The 'R' rating does indicate some intimate scenes, clever inter-cuts juxtaposing what the two forces were each doing at the moment. Music (by ""Broken-Social-Scene"") is timely applied at certain segments but sparingly. Well-rounded supporting cast, especially Anthony Mackie as Frank the 'friendly' dealer who may want to do right by Drey but only in the way he knows how within the realms of selling drugs (reminds me of w-d Boaz Yakin's ""Fresh"" 1994, brilliant debut performance by Sean Nelson as the 12-year old interacting with a dealer 'mentor').Kudos to all involved on ""Half Nelson"". The film was shot in Brooklyn, New York. Thanks to ThinkFilm for being the distributor (documentary: Spellbound; Murderball; March of the Penguins; drama: The Last Kiss - Italy; Kontroll - Hungary; Gus Van Sant's Gerry)."
The Day the Earth Stood Still,2008,5.5,A remake of the 1951 classic science fiction film about an alien visitor and his giant robot counterpart who visit Earth.,Jaden Smith is the worst part of this entire film! He alone makes it almost unwatchable!
Erin Brockovich,2000,7.5,A flamboyant law firm secretary works tirelessly to gain justice for a small town wrecked by a utility company's pollution.,"The only thing bigger than Julia Roberts' chest in ""Erin Brockovich"" is the heart this film has. While it is a drama, it would be more apt to describe the plot as a struggle, because it's all about fighting for what you believe in and overcoming the odds and all opposing forces. Nothing bad actually happens in this movie, at all, but it's the complications, the setbacks the moral struggles along the way that make it shine.""Erin Brockovich"" stars Julia Roberts in the title role in a film based on the true story of a twice-married mother of three who is desperate to find a way to make a living and provide for her family. After a failed attempt at suing for damages after a car accident, Brockovich turns to her lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), for a job doing anything she can at his law firm. Reluctantly he accepts and soon Brockovich finds herself uncovering a potentially huge case.Roberts had to have been a no-questions-asked best actress winner after this performance. As Brockovich she is incredible playing multiple roles as the loving mother, the driven working-woman, the troubled lover, everything. The mood swings are effortless for her. Perhaps the best element of her performance is that she comes across as glaringly flawed, even if she is quite likable. Her lines are killer and delivered with command. Though some of her rants are over the top, they're really clever nonetheless.Finney's character is much the same way. He is really enjoyable to watch and gives a great performance even though his character never gets truly dramatic.This is just a great screenplay by Susannah Grant. It's almost completely devoid of melodrama and yet it tackles so many real life issues. Brockovich's struggle to balance her work with her family brings up an issue that can connect with anyone, although the feminist tones of the film obviously won't connect as strongly with men. Director Steven Soderbergh feels very distant from the film. Every so often a shot or sequence will be artistic, but he allows the story to tell itself for the most part.""Erin Brockovich"" is better than the average feel-good story. When there's little melodrama and great acting, a feel-good story becomes a great movie. Sports films based on true stories are feel-good stories, but they don't get nominated for best picture. While it may all seem too good to be true and the positive seems to trump the negative more times than it ought to, the film still feels very real and one that no one should miss."
The Next Three Days,2010,7.3,A married couple's life is turned upside down when the wife is accused of a murder.,"This movie was awesome I was bored when I started to watch this, I was saying oh my, this is not all that, but it sucked me in after a few minutes and took me on an adrenaline ride that was totally unexpected. Awesome flick. Russel, you have my vote all the way on this one. Great acting, great building up, the script worked, the movie worked...and all those moments where I thought this is it there simply came these awesome moments, and then more awesomeness. This is one of those that catches you off guard, really. Russel and Banks connected in the scenes Truly they could not have gotten a better cast. All the little unexpected things get your adrenaline going. I recommend this hands down. It wove together so well, I appreciated the surprises which only builds you up until the end. Great."
The Mummy,1999,7.1,"At an archaeological dig in the ancient city of Hamunaptra, an American serving in the French Foreign Legion accidentally awakens a mummy who begins to wreak havoc as he searches for the reincarnation of his long-lost love.","From beneath the depths of Hell, the ultimate symbol of evil is about to be reborn.  Beyond mortality, beyond death, this creature of the undead will rise.  Darkness will fall for all of eternity...and this plague will forever swallow this planet Earth...About two thousand years ago, in the land of Ancient Egypt, a well-respected high priest known as Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) has been a very naughty man. His one-stand with the Pharaoh's mistress may very well cost him his life. After the Pharaoh discovers this illicit, forbidden love affair, Imhotep and the mistress murder the heartless Pharaoh without second thoughts.  As payback though, Imhotep is to suffer the gravest consequences...Imhotep is eventually sentenced to die a most horrifying death.  The Pharaoh's guards have buried him alive inside a tomb, complete with ravaging scarabs and all.  What's even worse is that the guards have placed a disturbing curse upon the buried soul.   Whoever opens the tomb of this ancient evil will awaken the curse that has lied dormant for thousands of ears.  All shall suffer eternal damnation, as the Mummy will release its unstoppable powers upon the lands and onto the cities.   His reign of terror will spread...For twenty centuries, this soul has rested in peace...  Jumping forward to 1925, a bunch of foolish archaeologists, driven by profit and ignoring all admonishments, have decided to open the tomb of the wretched Mummy.  Well, that decision was foolish...  Now, the armies of the dead will inhabit the Earth and evil will take over...  Only Colonel Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and his brave team of courageous souls can prvent the Mummy's plans to rule the planet.  Along with an alluring librarian and inspiring archaeologist (Rachel Weisz), her timid brother (John Hannah), and an even more craven sidekick, Beni (Kevin J. O'Connor), O'Connell and his company of wisecracking Smart Alec folks are mankind's last hope.  This though, happens to be another incident where the good guys are at the wrong place at the right time.  Heaven have mercy on these souls...  Will faith spare human lives, or can the world kiss hope goodbye?THE MUMMY is so much better than I originally anticipated.  The special effects alone will blow you away!  It is unbelievable how the Mummy is able to transform himself from a rotting, disintegrating corpse to a fully developed supernatural being, and even to a raging sandstorm.  Also, those creepy crawly scarabs scare the daylights out of me!  The scarabs literally crawl under people's skins!   Impressive production values, capturing and recreating the ruins of Hamunaptra at its full glory, serve as another highlight for THE MUMMY.Sure, there are also the monstrous zombies, the nightmarish flying locusts, and the fallen skies.  Yes, there is also the requisite damsel-in-distress (and love interest) who captures Imhotep's heart.  The venomous super-villain who must eat the flesh of others in order to survive is a plus as well.  However, director Stephen Sommers (DEEP RISING) transcends beyond clich√© material.  He brings to the audience original ideas with a refreshingly cool tone.  He makes sure that there is style within the special effects.  The eye-popping FX in general will keep crowds contented, and then some.It is tough to keep a straight face when watching this movie, but you have to praise Sommers and the cast for letting you have so much fun.  Yes, the dialogue is indeed ridiculous as for some of the sequences.  One scene that had me chuckling throughout was when all the slaves were synchronically chanting ""Imhotep!""  Kevin J. O'Connor finds himself having some of the best one-liners as he may eventually switch allegiances and serve a different master.  Yes, the humor is somewhat gratuitous, granted.  However, in all sincerity, the humor is needed to lighten the film's dark tone.The acting is more second rate.  Arnold Vosloo made a terrific villain and Rachel Weisz lights up the screen with her gorgeous presence.  Fraser and O'Connor are great also.  The rest of the cast is kind of listless though. In spite of that, THE MUMMY is a spectacular spectacle laced with show-stopping special effects and genuine chills.  The music, composed and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith is pulse pounding and excellent.  The orchestration is wonderful during this film's every thread of suspense.Overall, THE MUMMY is one of the best blockbusters of 1999.  Nonstop thrills and surprises galore highlight this enthusiastic, fun-filled entertainment. THE MUMMY has lots of fun and excitement.  The only flaw that prevents this film from being a full fledged four star movie is its occasional lapses in credibility and coherence.  At times, this film is extremely ludicrous, but who cares, its fanatically fun to watch.  Genre fans, take note.Remember, you cannot keep the dead buried forever...RATING: ***1/2 out of ****."
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,1995,5.6,"Casey Ryback, is on vacation, with his recently orphaned niece to attend his brothers funeral by train but when terrorists hijack it, to use as a mobile base to hack a top secret destructive US satellite, Ryback must stop them.","Steven Seagal reprises his role as a one time SEAL team captain, a counter-terrorist expert who had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive, and protect the hostages... He happens to be on the Grand Continental passenger train traveling from Denver to L.A... Seagal joins the only family he has, a 'cute kid' named Sarah (Katherine Heigl) after her parents died in a plane crash...Seagal has an electrifying screen presence... Seeing him in action is similar to appreciating modern art...The train is hijacked by a team of 'ugly men' with guns... Their chief, Travis Dane (Eric Bogosian), is a high-tech mastermind, who fakes his own death in order to gain control of a top-secret nuclear satellite... For this crazy technical genius, technology can be used for beauty or debasement, and 'until you plug it in, you just can't tell.'Dane's henchman Penn (Everett McGill) is a soldier of fortune freak, whose relationship with his boss resurfaced during Desert Storm...Morris Chestnut's focus is on humor and breath-taking sequences...Geoff Murphy's film is incredibly entertaining, combining action, martial arts, and dark sense of humor..."
Payback,1999,7.1,"After a successful heist, Porter is left for dead. Once he recovers, he seeks vengeance and wants his share of the money.","Payback, while admittedly one of the more violent movies out this year, was definitely an entertaining flick.Like the promo catch phrase says, this time you'll root for the bad guy.  If Gibson's character has any redeeming qualities, they are on a very short list.  Porter (Gibson) is violent, at times even cruel and the other characters aren't much better; some are worse.  Every character is from the wrong side of the tracks, even the cops are on the take and there are no punches pulled.  The only character you can really feel is a ""good guy"" is Rose, the stereotypical Callgirl with a heart of gold (although it's maybe only 10 karat, not a real 24 karat heart).Nevertheless, you will root for Porter.  Frankly, I don't think anyone else could have pulled off this role and still kept the support of the audience like Gibson did, but then he generally always plays the good guy with a twist.  This time, the twist is a little more savage than usual.All in all, if you enjoy the occasional violent romp on the big screen and you're a fan of Mel Gibson; Payback is worth seeing."
The X Files Movie,1998,7.0,Mulder and Scully must fight the government in a conspiracy and find the truth about an alien colonization of Earth.,"In 35,000 BC northern Texas, two men enter an ice cave to find shelter. They battle a mysterious creature. A black substance oozes from the creature and infects one of the men. In the present day, a boy falls into the cave and is infected by the black ooze. Firefighters climb in and are also attacked. One week later, the FBI is checking on a bomb threat in Dallas. Special Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) go to the building across the street on a hunch. They find the bomb and barely escape. The pair is made the scapegoats. Alvin Kurtzweil (Martin Landau) tells Fox that FEMA has a secret isolation ward in the building. The boy and the firefighters are found in the rubble presumed to be killed by the blast.Mulder and Scully's banter is back almost immediately. Everything that is beloved about the show is present in this movie. They are the outsiders. There is a conspiracy. There is something creepy. This is what true fans of the show love. For non-fans, this can be a bit of a climb to understand everything."
Robin Hood,2010,6.6,"In twelfth-century England, Robin Longstride and his band of marauders confront corruption in a local village and lead an uprising against the crown that will forever alter the balance of world power.","If you have seen Kingdom of Heaven Director's Cut then you will undoubtedly enjoy Robin Hood. While it may not be as bloody as Kingdom of Heaven, the action still remains exciting and brutal. People who have not seen that film will be disappointed by the lack of action and scenes that are too long.While I found the film to be exciting, I couldn't help but realise that this would have been great if it was a 15 (UK age certificate) rather than a 12a. The first action sequence is great as English soldiers attack a French castle but it felt restricted that you would never see any blood when someone is killed; a soldier is shot in the neck by an arrow but other than the arrow, they look completely fine. Early on a character dies but from the way it was edited, you would never have known. A film where the violence is as savage and as brutal as this, requires you to feel as if the characters are in great danger.A lot has been said about Russell Crowe and his acting in the film but I found little to complain about. He suited his role well. The supporting cast including Mark Strong, Cate Blanchett, Max von Sydow, William Hurt, Kevin Durand and Oscar Isaac are fantastic. They are all completely immersed into their roles. I never felt that someone else could have been casted instead.The cinematography is also really good but if only it was not let down by the editing. As a sword or axe is flung towards an enemies head, it cuts straight after the impact, loosing a sense of realism. The hurts the film much later on in the final action sequence.The film maintained my interest and the final action sequence was exciting. This is a film worth watching but if you are expecting the next Gladiator, I suggest waiting for the director's cut on DVD/ Blu-ray."
What Women Want,2000,6.5,"A cocky, chauvinistic advertising executive magically acquires the ability to hear what women are thinking.","The film What Women Want is about a man, Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson), who has been characterized as a 'man's man,' a male who is the type of guy that other men look up to. Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt) also stars and sends Marshall into a male power trip when she is offered a job position that he was trying so hard to get. Marshall is known for his ability to seduce women and fornicate with them. Most of the women in his life think that he is a self centered jerk, because of the way he objectifies them. Even his fifteen year old daughter feels as if they are not related because of his poor communication skills with women. But an unexpected twist took place one day while blow drying mousse in his hair. While he was going about his business, Marshall tripped, and fell into his bathtub full of water, being electrocuted severely. Oddly enough, what would kill a normal human being did not harm Nick in any way, rather than it mysteriously gave him the power to hear what women are thinking. So, equipped with his new skill, he goes about his day, not knowing he has this amazing ability. Throughout his random encounters with women, particularly at work, he comes to realize that all the women are not very fond of him.In all movies, there is always a message of some sort that the director is trying to express. In this particular film, I believe there is more than one message. One of the dilemmas the movie expressed was women do not know what they want. Throughout the movie, women were constantly complaining about men, or their hair, or their outfit. The truth is that women do not know what they do want; only what they don't want. Another message it displayed is a world renown problem: the concept that men do not have a clue about women. They communicate differently as men, and want different things as well. Is reading women's minds the only way for men to understand? I sure hope not.The technique of this movie is nothing to throw a fit over. The average cinematography isn't dazzling, but it is good enough to keep the viewer interested. The sound track was well thought out, with many famous songs helping out in several scenes and strongly assisting in setting the mood. A few things stand out in the movie that question reality. For example, Gibson falls into a full bathtub, gets electrocuted by thousands of volts, and only wakes up with a headache. At a different point in the movie he gets shocked again, but not by a household utensil. The second time it's by lightning, and again, just a headache. No singed eyebrows or fried shoelaces were to be found.What Women Want is an entertaining movie at the least. Mel Gibson, as always, does an excellent job portraying his character, as well as Helen Hunt. The cast did a well-rounded job, and no one was out of place. I enjoyed the movie thoroughly and enjoyed the humor. The film was filled with talented acting, laughs, and lighthearted suspense. It would be a good recommendation for anyone who is bored and desires a humorous, fun movie. The idea of a man being able to read women's minds is clever and amusing. Should this ever happen, would it be classified as a gift, or a nightmare?"
Ghostbusters,1984,7.8,"Three parapsychologists forced out of their university funding set up shop as a unique ghost removal service in New York City, attracting frightened yet skeptical customers.","There is no set definition of the word ""classic"" but I'm sure this film qualifies as such or will in the near future, since it was so unique and popular....and remains so today, over 20 years old later. It's just one of those films that you remember seeing when it came out at the theaters. I doubt if anyone has forgotten the catchy theme song, either.Despite numerous viewings, I still find this very funny as I suspect many people do, because it entertains so well. I know the story is ludicrous and I don't believe for one second in ghosts so I ignore the ""theology"" and just laugh at Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis, Annie Potts and Ernie Hudson.Murray, as he tends to do, grabs the spotlight more than the rest and delivers more laughs than any of the cast but my favorite was Moranis as the nerdy ""Louis Tully."" I wish his role had been bigger. All the guys, however, plus Sigourney Weaver, the love interest of the always-horny Murray, are fun. I even liked the sequel because most of this cast was included."
Thor,2011,7.0,"The powerful but arrogant god Thor is cast out of Asgard to live amongst humans in Midgard (Earth), where he soon becomes one of their finest defenders.","Reviewers say 'Thor' is lauded for its visual effects, performances, and exploration of Norse mythology. Hemsworth and Hiddleston shine, while themes of familial conflict and heroism resonate. The balance of action and character development is noted, though some find the story predictable. Humor and character chemistry are praised, but the romance is criticized. Pacing, CGI, and 3D effects are frequent discussion points. Overall, it's a strong MCU addition."
Sorstalans√°g,2005,7.0,"14-year-old Gy√∂rgy's life is torn apart in WWII Hungary, as he is deported first to Auschwitz and then to Buchenwald, where he is forced to become a man in the midst of hatred, and what it really means to be Jewish.","First of all, I have to tell, that I have not read the book yet, so I don't know how the book is like. But in my opinion the movie, in itself is really good. For me the movie had two major meanings. First, that all of us, who were not there in the camps, will never be able even to imagine how that was like. And the second, that people don't really listen to what you want to tell them, they listen to that, what they want to hear, and if your story does not satisfy them, because they want to hear something else, or because they can't accept your point of view, you will be left alone... And you will be lonely even among people of your own kind. And I think that's why this kid is fate-less, he himself tells at the and of the movie, he has to continue his life, which is not possible to continue, and he has to do this alone, because no one ever will understand him. Even fate has forsaken him."
Syriana,2005,6.9,A politically charged epic about the state of the oil industry in the hands of those personally involved in and affected by it.,"""Syriana"" is a blistering, powerful film about the degree to which governments and corporate conglomerates place the ambition to control the world's oil supply above the well being of their citizens and employees. In this game, there are only bad guys, and what separates the villains from the protagonists is not a question of who's good and who's bad, but rather how bad each is willing to be.So maybe ""Syriana"" doesn't tell us anything new. But that doesn't mean its points aren't worth making again and again. And though it is complicated, and I'm not going to pretend I followed every detail of its intricate plot, it's not *that* hard to follow. Stephen Gaghan is a good writer, and he provides a nice summary of the film's action in its final moments.What emerges from this tangled puzzle is a web of corruption and self-interest, all fueled by the need for oil. In one plot thread, the men behind two soon-to-merge oil companies will stop at nothing to make the merger go through, since the new company will be one of the most powerful in the world. In another thread, the law firm representing the company proves that it's eager to cash in on the company's new economic success. Meanwhile, a power struggle between the two sons of an aging king in an unspecified Middle Eastern country (though Saudi Arabia is obviously suggested) has attracted the attention of the American government, operating through the CIA. America (read American business) has a vested interest in which of the king's sons succeeds him to the throne: It doesn't want the reform-minded eldest son, whose priorities will be building a country to benefit his own people; it wants instead the younger son, who will continue to relegate his country to a cosy spot in America's hip pocket and take its orders directly from the president of the USA. And in the film's most chilling plot strand, we see how the struggle for oil feeds the radical Islam movement in the Middle East, providing young men with a feeling of brotherhood and righteousness in the face of a region they feel has turned its back on them in favor of big business and Western corruption.""Syriana"" is tense, fast and furious. Following it can admittedly be somewhat exhausting, but if you pay very close attention to the first hour or so, as each story is introduced and the relationships between characters become clear, the second half of the movie is easier to digest.I disagree with other comments here that the characters aren't developed or that the acting is unimpressive. On the contrary, I think all of the actors create extremely nuanced, compelling characters, a challenging task given the fact that none of them are allowed more than a minute or so at a time to feed us information about themselves. A movie like this could easily fall prey to filling itself with a bunch of stock villains, all cocked eyebrows and facial mannerisms rather than full-bodied characterizations, and the fact that it avoids this is a tribute to both Gaghan and the cast. And hats off to the editor on this movie, who had perhaps the most daunting task of the year.2005 has been full of terse, important films, fresh in their immediacy. There have been a small number of sensational, tough, thought-provoking films instead of a larger batch of more mediocre ones, as has been the case recently. ""Syriana"" is one of the best movies of the year: it's angry, yet it's not hopeless. I hope Americans see this movie. At this time of year, when people are trampling each other in malls in order to be first in line for Christmas sales, I hope they remember that the vast wealth of America frequently comes at the sake of people all over the world who will never have a fraction of the comfort those in our country take for granted.Grade: A"
Tommy Boy,1995,7.1,"After his auto-parts tycoon father dies, the overweight, underachieving son teams up with a snide accountant to try and save the family business.","This film has everything - laughs, tears, heart. It's a training film on how to make a memorable comedy. And it appears its studio had no faith in it initially, since it was released in the spring of 1995, a time of year when you are not competing with a bunch of blockbusters. It's in good company though. Clueless, another classic, was also released that spring.""Tommy Boy"" Callahan (Chris Farley) is a goof off and a screw up from childhood. It takes him seven years to graduate college, with a D average. But his dad ""Big Tom"" Callahan (Brian Dennehy) welcomes him home with pride and open arms. He gives Tommy an office at the family company, a manufacturer of auto parts. Tommy is always getting sideways with Richard (David Spade), Big Tom Callahan's right-hand man. Richard worked his way up in the company, considers Big Tom to be the father he never had, and he resents Tommy because everything is handed to him - the company, a great dad - and he doesn't seem to appreciate any of it.And then Big Tom dies suddenly, while he was in the process of expanding the company product line, so an extension in a loan is needed from the bank. But, to the bank, Big Tom WAS the company, and they really don't have faith in it without him. Tommy offers to put up his entire inheritance as collateral if the bank will give them a certain amount of time to get a large number of new sales, to prove the company still has a reputation outside of Big Tom's name. So this launches the lion's share of this film. Tommy, the neophyte who has never really had to work for anything, with Richard, the guy who has had to work for everything - on the road together, in Richard's prize car, trying to make the sales that will save the company.Speaking of that car, I've always loved the symbolism of Richard and his car. In the beginning of the movie, he is all about his car since it is really the only thing in his life since he has no friends. He employs a no eating rule in the car and is upset when M&Ms roll into his dash. As the movie goes along his car just keeps getting more and more trashed and he cares less and less. His relationship with his car is inversely proportional to his friendship with Tommy. This all climaxes when he is fully sold on helping Tommy by going to ridiculous lengths. When they arrive at the airport near the end, and the parking attendant tells Richard that he can't park his car there, he just throws him the keys and says ""keep it."" Symbolically trading his car for his friend.I'd highly recommend this, even if on the surface it might seem like just another sophomoric comedy, because it is not."
Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles,2001,4.8,"Australian Outback adventurer Mick ""Crocodile"" Dundee travels to Los Angeles with his young son while his longtime companion suspects foul play at a movie studio.","This movie is what people want out of Paul Hogan. Personally, I loved ""Almost an Angel"" and ""Lightning Jack."" But for those of you who don't quite get Paul Hogan's humor, why would you even bother watching the third installment of the Crocodile Dundee saga? The character of Michael J. ""Crocodile"" Dundee is someone to be adored by any child of the 80's. And I, for one, am so thankful Paul decided to give us one more. Its a story, again, about a ""fish out of water"" scenario but he pulls it off with astonishing bliss. Its been over a decade since we were graced with the comedy of Crocodile Dundee II but the magic and love and simplicity of the character is still apparent in Paul's portrayal of Dundee. I'm so glad Linda Kozlowski reprises her role as the sexy, Sue Charlton as well. Movies forget the aspect of ""characters"" and ""story"" nowadays and focus on hype, special effects and ""epic-ness."" I'm so glad there are still movies I can shed a tear to simply because of its kindness, simplicity and down-to-earth quality of its characters that I grew up with. Crocodile Dundee is Los Angeles is a wonderful finale for anyone who loves the first two. Paul Hogan did the world a wonderful thing when he created the character, so why not come back around by one final wonderful installment. At least check it out...."
The Hangover Part III,2013,5.9,"When one of their own is kidnapped by an angry gangster, the Wolf Pack must track down Mr. Chow, who has escaped from prison and is on the run.","Zach Galifianakis is now super annoying. When this started, we were laughing at him but his shtick is now tiring. They needed to downgrade his antics from mean-hearted to just simple stupidity. I know Todd Phillips is saving it for Alan to grow in this movie. But it started to happen too late.Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms seem to be going thru the motions. We miss the face tattoo. They needed to do something to replace it.Ken Jeong is actually doing something serious. In the first two, he was lovable bad guy. From the first moment as the naked guy in the car truck, we thought he couldn't do much damage. But in this one, he is causing real damage to the group.John Goodman is doing a new character Marshall. He's a new bad guy looking to get Mr Chow for stealing his gold. So he kidnaps Doug to force the group to catch Mr Chow for him. It's rather serious, and not that funny.It was good to see that Alan finally grow up, and dealt with Mr Chow."
28 Days Later...,2002,7.5,"Four weeks after a mysterious, incurable virus spreads throughout the United Kingdom, a handful of survivors try to find sanctuary.","28 Days Later successfully takes the zombie genre to a new level, this movie is far more than just a horror flick. There are some great characters, that you actually care about, some you'll like, some you'll be glad to see killed, but all solidly performed.The story is well written and avoids the clich√©d cheesy scripts that are too often attached to the horror genre. And I must add that the direction is exactly what you would expect from 'Danny Boyle' top class.For me though the real difference between this movie and many others made in this genre is as follows - The infected (the zombie like folk) are more menacing, they turn instantly and they move fast, a combination that would instill fear in every one of us.I don't mean to run down the zombie movie genre - I am a huge fan of most of these films, but lets be honest its been done to death, re-animated and done again, and this was the first movie to break the mould and transcend to a new level.If you like your horror flicks, then this is certainly worthy of your attention.9/10"
In the Land of Blood and Honey,2011,4.7,"During the Bosnian War, Danijel, a soldier fighting for the Serbs, re-encounters Ajla, a Bosnian who's now a captive in his camp he oversees. Their once promising connection has become ambiguous as their motives have changed.","I am no Serb/Croat/Bosnian... the film tells nothing about events i have encountered whatsoever so i have no interest whatsoever in choosing sides..,I am Just someone who enjoys cinema if it's good.But...this Film held almost nothing pour moi.The script seemed to lead nowhere..i seriously had the feeling a few times that the Director lost all control as to where we where heading.I mean we watch a couple dancing..suddenly there's an explosion en after that there is no reference to that explosion what so ever.When they later meet again, it's as if they never saw each other before.The character studies are awfully weak and stereotypical...why bother witch Photographical composition, well lit scenes etc.when awful things like mass-rape are taking place...I'v read in other reviews ' but it was very beautifully photographed' in this story that's a weakness IMO.In the first part we see the main character,Aijla wearing a lovely yellow coloured sweater..which gives great looking camera color & compositions and atmosphere...but...why? Why still bother which such details to make thing look good on a screen while mass rape and murder is taking place? some script changes are absolutely ridiculous and very far fetched.. another nuisance...the constant very close-up manner of filming the battle scenes..i found that disturbing and a style figure.....and yes.., many people complain about this ,..in this film about the Bosnian carnage the focus lies on the Serbian atrocities during this war..but that's no problem IMO..this film is a story about what happened to a part of the Bosnian victims.The Serbian side of the Bosnian-war story may be told by another film... My main objection is the creative shortcoming. It,to me was a boring movie.and should hold lessons in Filmmaker/vision For Jolie.Next time better !This film to me looked like a schoolgirls naive-sentiment in viewing the horror's of war. But those horrors were not presented in a horrible way... i presume the situation in reality was hell. We see a very stylish hell..with neat framed scenes , an unbelievable and for me, totally distant sort of 'love' story.., a very weak script to act on it must have been for the actors... , nice clothing and beautiful light.I was really in awe as to where the story took me..very far-fetched and naive. and the casting ...very much stereo-typing..not a creative choice of cast.Why have them speak American with a Balkan accent? you see this in a lot of films...to make it 'more realistic..but it easily becomes mediocre...It's far better & stronger to have them speak either Serb-Croatian or plain English... I never understand why they do that....and do not break-away from such a film-making dogma.let this 1th directional misser be a lesson For Jolie !"
Snake Eyes,1998,6.1,Corrupt Atlantic City police officer Rick Santoro and Navy Commander Kevin Dunn join forces to investigate both the assassination of Secretary of Defense Charles Kirkland and the disappearance of a beautiful stranger.,"Whether you are a fan of Cage, De Palma, Sinise or pulpy vintage thrillers, ""Snake Eyes"" has some goodies to offer. The guys are having all kinds of good fun, going about movie's biggest flaw, a plot that wants to be grounded, suspenseful, gritty, but loses plausibility and momentum the deeper we go. If You can turn a bit of a blind eye to that, welcome to Cage's world.Brian De Palma has made Nicolas Cage into the admirably positive minded, flamboyant, deeply flawed hero Ricky Santoro, a hotshot police detective with the amount of energy only Nic can provide. The story takes place on one night during a boxing match taking place at Atlantic City Casino, which Ricky attends together with his friend and naval officer Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise). Little did Ricky know, a massive criminal conspiracy is about to manifest itself with the murder of an important political figure right in the middle of the fight. Ricky, naturally, decides to uncover the mystery on his own and his own way.""Snake Eyes"" start enigmatically, beautifully, with the camera spinning up a 20 minute continuous dance, making first introductions and yet unknown connections between the variety of characters we'll see later on. Straight away it's more than apparent that fans of Cage like myself are in for a treat. Overacting it may be, I don't feel privileged enough to tell given the amusing character of Ricky, but take away Nicolas from the equation and, trust me, it looks worse now. A character like Santoro fits his energetic and amusing nature. As he's flowing around and interacting with an entertaining cast of familiar faces and good performances (Carla Gugino, Luis Guzman, Stan Shaw, Kevin Dunne), solving all kinds of little, pulpy, episodic, amusing problems, the bigger, more boring conspiracy is also uncovering. When the big cat's out of the bag, which is like half-way through the film, that's where ""Snake Eyes"" become slower, less exciting and a lot more predictable, or in other words, disappointing. The first half is a decent pulp dime novella, and the second an uninspired chase thriller.Multiple perceptions of a singular event, relationships between them, and the audience, is what ""Snake Eyes"" is mostly about, and I wonder what would've come out of it with a richer story and a less lackluster ending. De Palmas relentless visual style, paired with Cage's unique charms and the lively, saturated setting of a huge event in an arena, provides enjoyable jolts of pulpy melodrama. But when all the tricks are played, we are left with a movie too typical to ascend above others... Visually, the intro sequence is not the only impressive part, so those aspects endure, despite some other minor technical flaws (or bad ideas), like almost cartoon-like swooshing sounds during the boxing scenes.""Snake Eyes"" is not a great movie, but I do have a good amount of appreciation for it, particularly Palma's direction and, you know, Cage for the win! As a mystery/thriller of the 90's, it should please the seekers of such flicks. As for Cage fans, assemble, it will please. My rating: 6/10."
Winnie de Poeh,2011,7.1,"While searching for honey, Pooh and his friends embark on an adventure to find Eeyore's missing tail and rescue Christopher Robin from an unknown monster called The Backson.","I have always been a fan of AA Milne's charming and whimsical stories since an early age. The 1977 movie The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh epitomised the childhood innocence that made the stories so wonderful, as did the TV series The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. I also liked a vast majority of the various film and TV incarnations that were made between then and now.Ever since hearing of this movie I knew I wanted to see it. Part of me knew it would work, and for me when I saw it last night it did. My only complaint of Winnie the Pooh is the length, at barely an hour(exluding the credits and the short) the film is too short. Otherwise it is a wonderful movie that like the 1977 movie and TV series captures perfectly the childhood innocence that I know and love. Not only that, it is also a welcome return to the traditional animation style as seen with the original movie.Speaking of the animation it is great. I always felt The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh along with The Rescuers was the best looking of the 1970s Disney movies, it had an elegant and warm feeling to it. Winnie the Pooh maintains that elegant and warm feeling with colourful backgrounds, cutely drawn characters and ravishing colours. The songs and music heard in the movie aren't quite classic status perhaps, but they are very memorable in the melodies and sweet in the lyrics.The dialogue is delightfully droll, with a lot for children and adults to enjoy. The story is structurally thin somewhat, but it is never dull thanks to the bright and breezy pace and the familiar yet absolutely delightful story lines including Pooh hunting for honey, Eeyore hunting for his tail and the search for the creature that Owl thinks has carried off Christopher Robin. The characters are engaging and wonderfully whimsical, Pooh is still endearing, Tigger is very funny and Piglet is cute.The voice acting is terrific really. These are not the original voice actors, and most of the voice actors(excepting Jim Cummings) in the likes of Tigger Movie, Pooh's Heffalump Movie and Piglet's Big Movie don't return, but the new voice actors do make an effort to not sound too different. Jim Cummings still does a wonderful job as Pooh and Tigger, and John Cleese for me is the most thoughtful narrator of any Winnie the Pooh film since Sebastian Cabot. I wasn't so sure though about Tom Kenny at first as Rabbit, but he being a very talented voice actor is also good.Overall, delightful, charming and a lovely nostalgic trip down memory lane, if only it wasn't so short. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
The Internship,2013,6.3,"Two salesmen whose careers have been torpedoed by the digital age find their way into a coveted internship at Google, where they must compete with a group of young, tech-savvy geniuses for a shot at employment.","This is a formula ""back to school"" type of comedy with lots of product placement and two aging stars going through the motions. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson play the same roles they've played for most of the last decade -- themselves. If you are a big fan of them you can add a point or two to my score because they're the whole show here. The rest of the cast is made up of mostly unknowns playing various stereotypes that are familiar to anybody who has seen a high school or college comedy. They do fine and there are no standouts, good or bad, among them. John Goodman appears in a thankless supporting role. Will Ferrell does one of his usual cameos he does in the movies of his friends. He's worth a chuckle or two. Like I said, the movie is formulaic and predictable but it has a very pleasant upbeat tone throughout and quite a few amusing moments but nothing that will have you bowled over in laughter. There's a ton of product placement for Google. Literally the whole movie. So if that sort of thing bothers you, you might want to skip this one and save yourself the righteous indignation."
Lincoln,2012,7.3,"As the Civil War rages on, U.S President Abraham Lincoln struggles with continuing carnage on the battlefield as he fights with many inside his own cabinet on his decision to emancipate the slaves.","The very mention of a Steven Spielberg project and everyone goes bug-eyed in excitement and curiosity; everyone from casual movie goers to mainstream critics to cinema house managers. Now reunite Spielberg with long standing producing partner Kathleen Kennedy, throw in a multi-award winning star cast lead by Daniel Day-Lewis and a story about one of the most revered Presidents in US history and you have an Academy Award nominated movie by default. Lincoln has all these fine qualities and a whole lot more. This is not just a great film for the reasons stated above, or because it is very easy to praise a film directed by Spielberg. This is also not just a masterpiece or a very important and powerful film for the sake of calling it so. From the drawing boards to its last take, Lincoln is every bit exquisitely fashioned filmmaking ‚Äî an amalgamation of art, literature, politics, society, history, and most importantly, humanism.Here's a brief re-cap to get you up to speed on the relevance of the American Civil War (1861 to 1865) as depicted in the film. The United States of America is divided as cotton rich states of the South refuse to phase out slavery. After Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln secures the Presidency, almost a dozen states in the South pull out of the 'Union' and become the Confederate States of America. As a bloody civil war rages between North and South, the film's story begins with President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. This is the Commander and Chief of the armed forces calling for slavery to be abolished in all states by seeking a landmark constitutional amendment. For this to happen, Lincoln must procure enough votes through Congress for a stay order on making slavery illegal anywhere in America. Challenged with factions within his Republican party, Lincoln becomes his own worst enemy in a daunting personal crisis: save thousands of lives by ending the war or prolong the war in favour of ending slavery.Running at 150 minutes, this film is a slow burner with extensive dialogues and frequent courthouse debates; but like the trudging power of a steam locomotive, Lincoln pushes forward with remarkable pace while never losing sight of its destination. Piloting this powerhouse of a film is Daniel Day-Lewis in easily his finest hour as a method actor. His Lincoln is tall and bent over with war-stressed fatigue and a shrill voice, but armed with a quiver full of wisdom and remedial anecdotes for when push comes to shove. Throughout the narrative Lincoln is torn within as he manages his duties as the President of a nation, as a father who has lost a son, and as a husband who must confide in his wife when decisions become complex. This is also when I must mention Sally Field in another fine delivery as First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln and the epitome of the phrase 'Behind every great man is a woman'. Field's Mary is a tragic character whose depiction of a bleeding heart is memorable in a scene where she confronts Lincoln as the father of their children, not a man with immense power. With strong characterisation forming the flesh and blood of the film, you can also expect riveting roles from Tommy Lee Jones and David Strathairn, besides a multitude of top actors.This is one of the most important films of the year and perhaps even the times we live in. By its very making, Spielberg has written the greatest obituary for one of the greatest leaders of the modern world. Lincoln is to Steven Spielberg what Gandhi is to Richard Attenborough; the commonality being crucial moments in history, rather than a history lesson per se. If I have to nit-pick, I suspect there could be historical anomalies in the narrative if this film is solely considered a biopic. This is why I strongly recommend the film as a political drama rather than a componential biography. Is it safe to say that President Abraham Lincoln was a self-made man? That he was extremely intelligent despite dropping out of school? That he changed the future of an entire nation? That Barak Obama is the current President of the United States of America because Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery? If you said 'yes' to any of these questions then Lincoln is more than just an Academy Award magnet‚Äîit is a landmark film made by people reiterating that freedom is a birth right for people everywhere."
The Number 23,2007,6.4,"Walter Sparrow becomes obsessed with a novel that he believes was written about him, as more and more similarities between himself and his literary alter ego seem to arise.","The Number 23 (2007) is a movie I recently watched on Tubi. The storyline follows a family that becomes fascinated by a unique book. The husband as he reads the book finds he can uniquely relate to many aspects of the storyline and begins thinking the book is about him. His wife tries to keep him from ruining their family with his obsession but the more he digs the more he appears to be losing his mind.... This movie is directed by Joel Schumacher (A Time to Kill) and stars Jim Carey (Ace Venture), Virginia Madsen (Candyman), Danny Huston (The Aviator) and Corey Stoll (Ant-man). The storyline for this is very clever and intricate. I absolutely loved seeing Carey in this role and don't think they could have picked a better leading actor. The script was very good and Carey delivered a very relatable character. The murder mystery aspects were fairly intense and you have doubts right up till the end of the movie. I also loved how this movie concluded, very smart. Overall I think this movie is a little underrated and deserves a solid 8/10 score and I'd strongly recommend seeing this once."
Swordfish,2001,6.5,"A covert counter-terrorist unit called Black Cell led by Gabriel Shear wants the money to help finance their war against international terrorism, but it's all locked away. Gabriel brings in convicted hacker Stanley Jobson to help him.","What is the highest pressure job interview you've ever had?Well, Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackman) a convicted Hacker, fresh out of prison and desperate to see his daughter again, can beat you, i'll bet on it. He has to hack into the FBI Computers in a fairly public place, with a gun to his head and a beautiful woman performing an act of Felacio on him, and he has just one minute to do it. (A Great Scene, Not Explict, just cool)Anyway, he is recruited by John Travolta to hack into a dormant DEA Fund worth 9.5 Billion Dollars to finance his terrorist activities.Full of Slick Dialogue, cool Direction and the simply gorgeous Halle Berry, this turns out to be a very enjoyable Thriller, with some clever twists (some of which don't quite work) but are forgivable anyway.Not a classic, but a good film none the less. 8/10"
The Mask,1994,7.0,Bank clerk Stanley Ipkiss is transformed into a manic superhero when he wears a mysterious mask.,"Jim Carrey plays Stanley Ipkiss, a ""zero"" as the film tagline says, who never speaks his mind about anything. The typical mild-mannered guy.After Stanley finds an enchanted mask under a bridge one day, though, everything changes. He goes from ""zero to hero"". But first, he plays around with his new found menacing powers.Calling the mask a hero is like calling Hitler kind of a good guy. The mask makes Stanley rob banks, scare people and more. He's half-hero.""The Mask"" is not great, but it fits Carrey's film persona quite well. He bounces off the wall (literally) and just doesn't sit still. Typical Carrey.If you're not one for loser-to-hero films or wacky slapstick, don't see ""The Mask"". Otherwise, it's worth a peek.3/5 stars"
Children of Men,2006,7.9,"In 2027, in a chaotic world in which women have somehow become infertile, a former activist agrees to help transport a miraculously pregnant woman to a sanctuary at sea.","OK, I only got through the first 3 pages of comments but let me add my own.1) Fantastic cinematography. Some like hand-held, some don't. It certainly worked very well here.2) Related to (1), very long shots. There is one scene where the camera lens has blood splats on it for quite a few minutes. Hollywood would get rid of it, but for this movie it adds amazingly to the atmosphere that is being created.3) Like ""Code46"" the technology is in the background. Just the way it should be, allowing us to focus on the story.4) Theo as the central character NEVER picks up a gun, despite them being all over the place and easily available. As a viewer you are almost willing him to do so, to manage some of his challenges - but very deliberately the character does not.5) I've read separately that yes this is a comment on current society. Being an Australian, with our controversial immigration laws and practices, that rings true.6) Similar to (5), using the term ""Homeland Security"" in the movie is an obvious reference.7) The revolutionaries/terrorists/fishes are shown to be just as political and militant as the government they oppose.There are more, but that is enough. Overall a wonderful movie which leaves me thinking for a long time, which is all I ask.Cheers!Anton."
Moon,2009,7.8,"Astronaut Sam Bell has a quintessentially personal encounter toward the end of his three-year stint on the Moon, where he, working alongside his computer, GERTY, sends back to Earth parcels of a resource that has helped diminish our planet's power problems.","I was led to this movie, partly because of a sort of dissatisfaction from what we've known as science fiction due to Star-Treks, Star wars, terminators and transformers. On my visit to the local independent movie theater, I was only expecting something like Apollo 13 and I would've been satisfied with just that.But the movie proved to be much more. It wasn't just the cinematography, few captivating shots of the moon surface, or the great acting performance. It was as if the movie took a while to ponder over philosophical questions that science and technology raise- something that every science fiction ought to do.This work won't be unworthy of a comparison with Kubrick's- space odyssey ‚Äì only that it is probably not as visually stimulating as the latter. It does make good use of classical music like Kubrick's. I found the movie to be a bit more accessible than Tarkovsky's Solaris in that it is much more fluid and entertaining (Solaris was 3 hr long ‚Äì executed very slow albeit with a similar idea). Like Solaris, the protagonist's recollections of the life on earth eventually result in some mental instability, but the movie stays away from getting into long philosophical debates on human experience or our place on earth.In general, do expect a lot more than space travel in this movie. To cite an example, the isolation of Sam made him more attached to memories of his life on earth. I don't recall many other movies that have expressed it so well that in isolation, nothing really means anything. Kudos to the director! Such existentialist reflections aside, there are many instances when the movie makes a statement about unethical corporate practices, evasive HR responses - almost to the extent 'Michael Clayton' did. I think that makes it more worthwhile to watch. Still despite all that, it avoids taking any stances on controversies that bother all of us in modern times. It puts us through the fears of the unknown, catastrophes of distrust and what arises from distrust and isolation and all of that.Still, somehow the movie isn't really as dark as the script might make it sound. There is isolation, mistrust, schemes, confusion, curiosities and despair, but the human experience probably transcends the realism of its existence ‚Äì that was the idea I carried back from the movie theater."
Agora,2009,7.1,"A historical drama set in Roman Egypt, concerning a slave who turns to the rising tide of Christianity in the hope of pursuing freedom while falling in love with his mistress, the philosophy and mathematics professor Hypatia of Alexandria.","I was familiar with the Hypatia story because a certain category of people in my native country choose to present here as a martyr from a bygone golden age of reason, rapidly receding before the encompassing waves of Cristian barbarity and obscurantism. I think in general this is also the view this movie takes.The character of Hypatia is presented as logical, brilliant, prudent with thirst for learning for it's own sake. The only problem that a modern sensibility could find with her is her attitude towards slaves, which seem to reflect the ideas of the educated elite of the times(of antiquity in general because even people of the calibre of Aristotle shared such conceptions). Otherwise she is perfect.In a very imperfect world one must note, because the society she lives in is convulsed by civil strife and feuds between Christians, Pagans and Jews.As the movie progresses they eventually become Christian and Jews because Pagans convert to Christianity because of the attitudes of imperial authority and political expediency. Although this is not fully explained, how a very powerful pagan element becomes impotent in the second half of the movie. I think the scenario is problematic there.Also the beliefs of the group in which Hypatia belongs are not really clarified. There were pagan, believers of the aegypian Gods(there is a statue of Serapis), of Greek Gods of Roman Gods or just agnostic rationalists(as Hypatia seems to be) belonging to a pagan upper class environment? On the other side, the Christian, the ""Parabalanoi"" whose existence I have not verified as a social group or lay monastic order or something in between, are presented as a bunch of idiotic thugs, the equivalent of modern hooligans with a religious veneer, keen to kill, pillage and rape(although this is hinted rather discreetly)supposedly in the name of Jesus.The leader of the Christians Cyril-a historical personage who became a saint, as the final titles of the movie correctly state, is portrayed as a power-hungry(there is scene in which he avidly takes the bishop's ring from the hand of his dead predecessor), manipulative bigot. His aim is to become master of Alexandria and Christianity is his tool, while the Prefect-the political authority- stands in his way.The Prefect, being a former student of Hypatia is advised by her, thus she earns the enmity of Cyril- with fatal results. His portrayal matches with a sketch of him by Bertrand Russell in ""History of Western Philosophy"":""St Cyril, the advocate of unity, was a man of fanatical zeal. He used his position as patriarch to incite pogroms against the very large Jewish colony in Alexandria. His chief claim to fame is the lynching of Hypatia, a distinguished lady who, in an age of bigotry, adhered to the Neoplatonic philosophy and devoted her talents to mathematics."" The way he is in the movie seems inspired by this passage, as if the makers of the movie were based on that. Nevertheless it was effective since they made the viewers find despicable a man dead by 1.600 years.There is only one scene where the Christian religion is presented with some sympathy and that is where the slave(who is secretly in love with his mistress Hypatia) is convinced to exercise the virtue of charity, by an otherwise negatively portrayed zealot(Ammonius), through giving food(bread)to the poor, who are many and needy. It is a moving scene and the sole in movie akin to present Christianity in a positive light.Religious struggle is presented as a power struggle, which may be correct when one leaves the realm of individual conscience and enters the public arena. Pagans, Christians and Jews(both people and leaders) are equally bad, the worse being the Christian zealots ""Parabolani"", to which a freed slave of Hypatia now belongs. Orestes, the Prefect, a former student of Hypatia, is better as a character than Cyril or Synesius, another student of Hypatia, now a high-class Church dignitary.(One though is left with the impression that Hypatia operated the Harvard of her times!) The end of the movie, presents a view of events censored compared to the one we have from historical sources, as to what exactly happened to Hypatia.I think that the actress playing Hypatia is fine and convincing as a free spirit in an age of bigotry and also good is the performance of her two unconsummated would-be-lovers the aristocrat and latter Prefect Orestes and the slave and latter Christian zealot, Davus. The actor playing Cyril conveys the aura of sliminess and bigotry of a religious power-player.Scenery and costumes are superb to watch but I do not know enough about Alexandrian geography and clothing habits to vouch for their historical accuracy.It is a movie worth seen although it leaves a bitter taste in the end and tries to say and mix too many and too weighty matters in the brief span of a cinematic exhibition."
Dumb and Dumber,1994,7.3,"After a woman leaves a briefcase at the airport terminal, a dumb limo driver and his dumber friend set out on a hilarious cross-country road trip to Aspen to return it.","When this first came out in 1994, wild horses couldn't drag me to the theater to see it. Why? Preconceived notions. Thank goodness for Cable TV, or I never would have seen this film. I like it, it makes me laugh.This is not a masterpiece. This is not an academy award winning film, not a film of strategic plots, this is as sophomoric as it gets  -- and that's fine with me. Sometimes, ya gotta escape. This'll do it.The title says it all. Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey are perfect for their roles, every time I watch this film uncut, I am laughing. I was always thinking, ""How dumb can you get?"" And in the next frame it gets dumber.This is one of those films you just have fun with. Either you like this kind of humor or you don't. But the world is in such turmoil, this is a welcomed, stupid, silly, break that hits just the right spot. I find it ""stupid-funny"" beyond belief."

Agent persuades a social worker, who is adept with a new experimental technology, to enter the mind of a comatose serial killer in order to learn where he has hidden his latest kidnap victim.","This movie is definitely a case of style over substance but the style is good and certainly more than unique on its own to make ""The Cell"" a memorable and above average movie.""The Cell"" is beautifully looking with impressive sets, costumes and make-up. Yes, it's real eye candy to watch all. The movie has some perfectly 'dreamy' sequences that are certainly odd but also very beautiful and imaginative to look at. This movie is a perfect mix of an art-house type of movie and a typical Hollywood-thriller, that is accessible to both fans of the genre.The story itself is pretty far fetched and doesn't always make sense. Because of that the movie isn't always pleasant and likable to watch but like I mentioned before, the style compensates for this. The style makes you keep watching till the end and provides the best moments of the movie.Vincent D'Onofrio is unforgettable as the serial-killer with a twisted mind. Vincent D'Onofrio is really underused as an actor and this movie shows his talent once more. I'm not particularly happy about the casting of Jennifer Lopez. I know that she can act in some of her movies but she really wasn't suitable to play the main character in this movie. Her character wasn't strong enough and she was overshadowed by Vincent D'Onofrio and Vince Vaughn. Still I felt that Vince Vaughn was also miscast in this movie. He didn't fit the role well enough and no, I'm not saying that because I'm used of seeing him only in comedies now days. The rest of the supporting cast is good and still give the movie a certain degree of credibility.The musical score by Howard Shore was also surprising good and was sort of ""Se7en"" like at times. It suited the movie well and gave some of the scene's some extra mood and atmosphere.It's a far from perfect movie and the concept is far fetched and not always handled in the right way. Still ""The Cell"" is a perfectly watchable movie and perhaps even a bit of a must see, due to its style, originality and creativity.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
Man of Steel,2013,7.1,An alien child is evacuated from his dying world and sent to Earth to live among humans. His peace is threatened when other survivors of his home planet invade Earth.,"An epic Superman film one of the best ones that is incredibly well directed by Zack Snyder! Goes from explaining how Clark/Superman gets sent to earth because of his parents to the right amount of character development with Lois Lane and power along with epic action sequences. I've seen a few times even then I really liked it, this adaption deserves plenty of praise all around. The cast is excellent, beautiful cinematography, amazing story, emotions on point, and superb action!"
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly",1966,8.8,A bounty-hunting scam joins two men in an uneasy alliance against a third in a race to find a fortune in gold buried in a remote cemetery.,"Reviewers say 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is celebrated for its iconic characters, stellar performances, and Morricone's score. Leone's direction, cinematography, and moral complexity receive high praise. However, some critics note the film's length and confusing plot as drawbacks. A few reviewers mention underdeveloped characters and plain storytelling. Despite these issues, its cultural impact, visual style, and timeless appeal are often highlighted."
1984,1984,7.0,"In a totalitarian future society, Winston Smith, whose work is re-writing history, tries to rebel. He meets a kindred spirit named Julia and they fall into a love affair.","From the opening shot of ""Nineteen Eighty Four"" the viewer is plunged right into the hellhole of Oceania and the ultimate totalitarian nightmare. Whilst the year 1984 may be long past us, the essential themes of George Orwell's best known work still remain as timely and as relevant as ever.Winston Smith (John Hurt) is a drone worker in the Bureau of Information, and his job is to edit the news in accordance with the needs of the governing Party (which is in continual, seemingly endless war with Eurasia and other opposing states).  He must also refer to the dictionary of Newsspeak, which is the government's language for the distribution of information.He lives in a world where there is no escape from the authority of the government who regiment the every thought and deed of their subjects.  The Party is steadily working on a way to outlaw the concept of the family and the idea of conception.  This is done to eradicate Thoughtcrime and guarantee the worker's total devotion to the Party and its leader, Big Brother.Winston abides by this (recording his increasingly ambiguous thoughts about society in a hidden, handwritten diary) until he encounters Julia (Suzanna Hamilton), a strange young women with rebellious ideas, to whom he develops a powerful attraction.  But their passionate, forbidden relationship cannot escape the all-seeing eyes of Big Brother.....Screenwriter Jonathan Gems has a done a terrific job with the script.  He successfully translates Orwell's ideas to the screen with great clarity. Micheal Radford directs with subtlety around the greasy sets and crumbling locations (the picture was filmed in and around the very area in which Orwell set his novel).The performances from the chief principals are very strong.  John Hurt is excellent as Winston, bringing a subtle and considerate approach to the character.  Particularly disturbing is his final scenes, as he becomes gaunt and disfigured through government torture.  Suzanna Hamilton is gentle and quirky as Julia and ""Rab C Nesbitt"" actor Gregor Fisher appears as Winston's ill-fated friend, Parsons.Veteran actor Richard Burton lends a cold charisma to government enforcer O'Brien and he too excels in the film's final moments, as he coolly and sadistically tortures Winston, subjecting him to severe physical pain to subdue him, casually pulling a tooth out of his rotting mouth, then exposing him to the horrors of Room 101, all the while exhorting obedience to the Party and love to Big Brother.The strong relevance of the concepts of ""Nineteen Eighty Four"" should not be underestimated.  Whilst the term ""Big Brother"" is now synonymous with the ridiculous ""reality"" TV shows of the same name, others like the Two Minutes Hate (in which the workers are coerced, through a two-minute broadcast, into hating the enemies of the state); the idea of a government waging a perpetual war to advocate ""peace"" (especially relevant in the aftermath of September 11) as well as the editing of news and the abuse of language in order to suit the needs of government and disguise its true agendas are ideas that are chillingly present in today's society.All of this is powerful and thought-provoking stuff, and helps to make ""Nineteen Eighty Four"" an accurate and powerful rendering of a still very timely piece of work."
The Blind Side,2009,7.6,"The story of Michael Oher, a homeless and traumatized boy who became an All-American football player and first-round NFL draft pick with the help of a caring woman and her family.","Just watched this after reading a news article in the entertainment section of an online newspaper and thought I'd look it up.Went onto YouTube because the newspaper's video clip wouldn't work, YouTube didn't let me down and I was able to watch a clip.I have to admit that although I have enjoyed all the films that Sandra Bullock has made and have a bit of a soft spot for her, which means that I will watch anything that she is in, I've always thought of her as a bit of an acting lightweight, always seeming to be in those slightly off, quirky type of acting roles in the films she's appeared in.In The Blind Side she's had me change my view of her as an actress, as in this film we get to see her really act seriously, making the role her own and showing that she can really act.Her character is so believable and I so hope true to life of the real person that she was playing in the film - and to me showed a different side to her acting talent that really up until now I haven't really seen before.This film is worth watching for the story and all the great acting in the film from all concerned.If you have a couple of hours to spare this film is well worth the time to watch and enjoy and end up feeling warm and cosy by the end :)"
A nyomoz√≥,2008,7.4,"Badly needing money for the treatment of his ill mother, pathologist Tibor Malk√°v accepts the proposition of a stranger to murder someone he doesn't know a thing about.","There were a lot of good reviews on this title, so my girlfriend asked me to go and see this title with her. To tell the truth, I had low expectations: I thought this was going to be either a ""too artistic"" thing, or what is even worse, a cheap comedy. Boy, was I wrong! This is truly delicate and talented film making. The tone seemed very unusual, almost uncomfortable in the first few minutes, and there were some scenes which resembled ""Six Feet Under"" a bit too much. However, as the story went on, everything clicked into place: it was entertaining, well paced, and soon I was totally carried away with the flow. Acting was superb, especially by Zsolt Anger, who really steal the show. At the very end, there is a very well constructed and sophisticated moment, a small joke, that kind of wakes you up and shows you that what you have just seen is a masterpiece.Let me also add that the tone of the movie reminded me of the work of stage director Bela Pinter: sin and punishment, serious themes, deep thoughts - all perfectly wrapped in a comedy-like outfit, a perfect mix. Modern, lightweight, entertaining - this movie is a work of art."
Hair,1979,7.5,"Claude Bukowski leaves the family ranch in Oklahoma for New York where he is rapidly embraced into the hippie group of youngsters led by Berger, yet he's already been drafted. He soon falls in love with Sheila Franklin, a rich girl but still a rebel inside.","The stage play ""Hair"" is primarily remembered now for two things....its shocking frankness and its music.  In bringing the musical to the big screen (belatedly), the bulk of the stage version's loose plot was discarded and a more conventional storyline was created to link the songs together.  This seems to either please or alienate people, depending on their relationship to the original show.  In any case, the great majority of the songs are retained in this filmization which is more than can be said for many, many stage to screen adaptations.  And what music!  In most cases, the vocalizing even exceeds the quality of what could be found onstage, though the authenticity of the performers is obviously forsaken somewhat as the original cast was LIVING this at the time they were in the show.  The film's plot concerns an Oklahoma farm boy (Savage) who's on his way to report for active military duty during Vietnam.  He is waylaid in Central Park by a clatch of hippies led by Williams.  He also spies the girl of his dreams (D'Angelo), a debutante who rides by on horseback in the midst of all the free love gyrations taking place in the park.  The rest of the movie concerns the connections of these characters as they experience culture clash, sharing, understanding and even love.  There is copious drug use and rebellion against the wealthy along with hallucinogenic dancing and skinny dipping.  Eventually, one character makes a gesture for another which winds up costing more than could ever have been imagined.  This moment makes for a hugely poignant ending to what is mostly a light-hearted and ebullient film. True, more than a little of the original subject matter has been tossed aside, but the filmmakers must be credited for (almost) successfully weaving a story around the songs (which are quite varied in their style and content.)  The story fails with regard to creating a believable bond between Savage and D'Angelo that would endure the way it does in the story.  They hardly spend any time together in the bulk of the film (and quarrel a lot during that!), yet supposedly have this amazing love.  ""Aquarius"" gets the movie to a rousing, eye-opening start and it's just the beginning of many striking, effervescent musical moments in the show.  Oddly, the one song that is badly arranged, poorly sung and just basically mangled is the title number!  Most of the rest are excellent.  NOTHING is better than complete unknown Barnes' rendition of ""Easy to be Hard"".  She knocks the song completely out of the ball park and, sadly and inexplicably, her career went nowhere.  Williams is, at times, deliriously sexy here.  He comes off as annoyingly arrogant and stubborn at first, but eventually wins the audience over with his innate charm and vibrant talent.  As the movie nears it's close, he soars into the hunk stratosphere when, ironically, he cuts his hair.  Savage doesn't come off at all like an Oklahoman, but manages to display the contrast of his and Williams' characters.  He does an adequate job in all departments throughout.  D'Angelo (two years after her jaw-dropping role in ""The Sentinel""!) is hardly debutante material and comes off as icy much of the time, but she has her moments as well.  Chapin does a bang up job as her brother.  The remainder of the hippie gang are acquired tastes.  Wright does pretty well, but went nowhere after this.  Golden just looks dazed and chews gum incessantly.  Dacus is quite weak and does little to enhance the film.  What's surprising is how a film that contains lengthy shots of bare breasts, male rear ends (and even split second male frontal nudity) was considered benign enough to warrant a PG rating, yet now, nearly 25 years later, America seems to still have a Puritanical viewpoint towards the human body when compared to other countries.  The tide has turned backward from the free love and self-expression era (except in trash like ""The Jerry Springer Show"" and ""Howard Stern"".)"
Being John Malkovich,1999,7.7,A puppeteer discovers a portal that leads literally into the head of movie star John Malkovich.,"Charlie Kaufman (script) and Spike Jonze (director) burst on the scene together with their collaboration on this crazy masterpiece. 'Being John Malkovich' pushes the limits of storytelling; this wildly imaginative film shows that even the most surreal storyline can still be made entertaining if a filmmaker doesn't care about conventions and knows just what the medium is capable of. Perhaps the most original release in a year that had several very original releases ('Fight Club' and 'The Matrix' were both also released in '99), the film's playful creative energy had an effect on screenwriters, directors, actors and producers that can hardly be overstated. There had simply never been anything like it - and one only has to look at a contemporary TV show like 'Legion' to see what a mark this film left. Groundbreaking and simply inspired. 9 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/"
Stranger Than Fiction,2006,7.5,"I.R.S. auditor Harold Crick suddenly finds his mundane Chicago life to be the subject of narration only he can hear: narration that begins to affect his entire existence, from his work to his love life to his death.","I saw an advanced screening of Stranger than Fiction tonight on the Sony lot, as part of the Merrill Lynch media conference being held this week in Pasadena, CA.I hadn't heard much about this movie prior to seeing it tonight, so I had NO expectations, which is really how I like to see a movie (without any preconceived notions, good or bad).The movie was very well acted, and told an interesting story. I kind of look at Will Ferrell in this movie the way I looked at Adam Sandler after ""Punch Drunk Love"". You're not sure how to react to Ferrell/Sandler's on-screen persona's, as up to this point, you've always thought of them as the funny men, who couldn't (or wouldn't) attempt a more dramatic role. For Ferrell, who's probably at the height of his popularity, this was a good move for him, as well as an ideal role.All in all, I really liked this movie, and I would definitely recommend it to friends/family."
Quills,2000,7.2,"In a Napoleonic era insane asylum, an inmate, the irrepressible Marquis De Sade, fights a battle of wills against a tyrannically prudish doctor.","QUILLS / (2000) ***1/2 (out of four)By Blake French:""To know virtue we must aquatint ourselves with vice.""Marquis de SadePhilip Kaufman's ""Quills"" will leave some audiences cheering and others disappointed and disgusted; there are good logical arguments from both sides. One of the most controversial movie of the year, ""Quills, "" based on the play by Douglas Wright, doesn't entirely examine the torpid mind of the disreputable 18th century French author, the Marquis de Sade, but instead indicates the impact his sexually and sadistically explicit literary work influenced the public. The biggest argument could be made with the sanity of Marquis de Sade himself, as whether he was a perverted, sex-obsessed psychopath or simply a spirited aristocrat who only stood for artistic expression and freedom of speech. The movie's characters take their own sides; after becoming aware of the authors material, Napoleon wants de Sade (Geoffrey Rush) shot dead at the insane asylum he is being held at, but instead a sadistic torturer named Dr. Royer-Collard (Michael Caine) is assigned to take charge of the patient; the virginal laundress Madeleine (Kate Winslet) , thinks de Sade is a writer, not a madman, and helps to smuggle his erotic stories out of the institution for public publication; the asylum priest, Adde Coulmier (Joaquin Phoenix), first befriends de Sade and grants him special privileges, but once he discovers the extremity of his subversive ideas, he reluctantly changes opinions. De Sade inarguably had some fanatical fantasies, but the film leaves it up to us to realize his lustful imagination captured on paper are transpired due to his inability to experience them in the real world outside of his chambers. The subject is carnal and a bit unsettling, and the movie exploits the eroticism clearly on screen; the film is strictly intended for mature audiences. But director Philip Kaufman (""The Right Stuff"") does not portray the likes of de Sade in a disturbing manner, but keeps the story engaging. The atmosphere feels accurate and convincing, and the movie is not without humor and the expected material found within the mental institution, like the patient who thinks he is a bird, a pyromaniac, and the hulking horny guy who has his mind set out on raping any human with two legs with no external organs between them. There are a few scenes that could have captured the audience a bit more exclusively. However the entirely convincing, intense, brave, Oscar worthy performances by Michael Caine and Geoffrey Rush make up for that. The Marquis was an extremely complex individual, and Rush captures that through a character without heart or compassion, but with spirit and zest; even though de Sade went through each day with suffering, he still approached life with insight, ambition and curiosity. He is so determined to fulfill his need to write his perverse ideas, after forbidden and when his quills are taken away he still prevails by using blood, wine, and feces in the place of ink, and his clothes, sheets, and walls as paper. De Sade stands as an example that society is most successfully established when people understand that we are all simply expressions of our own nature, that it is most healthy to declare our motives and passions to ourselves. He is also a prime example of self-control, and that freedom of speech only carries us so far. It would be interesting to see what would happen if Marquis de Sade was to live in present times and if he was to exploit his ideas on screen or in novels. I think he would push the envelope to yet another level and have quite an influence on today's society. I hope people who see the artful ""Quills"" share their opinions with one another, after all, that is the reason why filmmakers make movies like these."
Blue Valentine,2010,7.3,"The relationship of a contemporary married couple, charting their evolution over a span of years by cross-cutting between time periods.","Surprisingly well done. I was a bit skeptical at first, but as I traveled my way through this story, it made more sense than many other attempts to capture this concept and present it well. Michelle Williams really shines here, it may be her best role yet, at least that I'm aware of.The key point here is that is an anatomy of a marriage that has dissolved over time, becoming increasingly irrelevant to the wife, and evermore difficult for the husband to comprehend or connect with what's going on with his wife.I've seen this before, in real life. Sometimes, marriages just come apart over time, even if they started out with the best of intentions and all the chemistry that can be imagined. It just happens . . . people change over time, and often, not in sync with each other. There's no real ""bad guy"" in the scenario portrayed . . . just the realities of how people drift apart, to the point of no return. Trust me on this one, this does happen.This film may not be for everyone, but for those who can relate with this type of story, this is probably one of the best attempts yet which delivers a reasonably realistic depiction of what this can be like."
Wag the Dog,1997,7.1,"Shortly before an election, a spin-doctor and a Hollywood producer join efforts to fabricate a war in order to cover up a Presidential sex scandal.","Rarely can film satire make you laugh and be worried about the future at the same time. Levinson's film does just that, with a great cast and great writing, this film succeeds.You may have noticed that many of the posts and reviews argue that this is not plausible. Obviously these posters do not realize that satire is supposed to be over the top and show what can happen in extremes, and ironically, this came out just after Clinton's sex scandal, and is still relevant today with George W. and will continue to be regardless of the president. Also, some may think it oversimplifies the public as idiots, but this isn't true, especially if they are being deceived and information is withheld. There are some implausibilities, as in why no reporters went to Albania or how other countries didn't get involved other than denying the charges, but these are small and even addressed in scenes with the rival candidates, news reporters and even CIA head William H. Macy.Really I don't know how anyone can not like this film since it is smart, funny and scary all at once with fine performances and direction all around. This is an American political satire classic that is sadly becoming less satire as time goes on.OVERALL: 9/10. Buy or at least rent before the satire becomes reality."
Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,1994,6.3,"When the brilliant but unorthodox scientist Dr. Victor Frankenstein rejects the artificial man that he has created, the Creature escapes and later swears revenge.","In 1992 we got a romanticized version of Dracula. It seems that its success brought two like-minded movies in 1994: ""Wolf"" and ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein."" Neither of them reached the acclaim level of ""Bram Stokers' Dracula.""""Frankenstein"" seemed too rushed. It was a big expensive production with a more than adequate budget. It had the look and feel as if they had to cut down a three hour movie to two. Things developed too quickly which made the key characters seem as though they were overly emotional and driven without a substantial motive.All the proper elements were there for the movie to be as good as ""Dracula"": the budget, the cast, the set, and the story. If they could've slowed things down just a tad then the movie would've been so much better."
The Descendants,2011,7.3,A land baron tries to reconnect with his two daughters after his wife is seriously injured in a boating accident.,"With the promising cast, an interesting subject matter, the substantial awards attention, the critical acclaim and being familiar with and highly appreciating much of Alexander Payne's work (especially 'Sideways', his recent film 'Downsizing' is an exeption), interest in seeing 'The Descendants' was high.On the most part, after finally seeing it, 'The Descendants' delivers. It's not perfect and it doesn't quite make it in my list of my favourite films of 2011. It's not Payne's best or my favourite of his, as indicated already that's 'Sideways' while also loving 'About Schmidt' and 'Election'. Its many good points however are outstanding and far outweigh the issues, making it a very good film and almost (but not quite) great one. Considering though that it had all the ingredients to be great, that it wasn't quite gave a slight air of disappointment.'The Descendants' may not say much new or deep, for a film with heavy and complicated themes this will disappoint some, part of me thought in places things could have gone into more detail.A few parts came over as being too convenient in occurrence and resolution. Perhaps there could have been less narration, which actually isn't that irritating or over-used but the film would have worked without it.However, 'The Descendants' is gorgeously shot, making the most of and clearly loving the picturesque Hawaiian locations and landscapes that makes one want to book a holiday there immediately. The use of traditional Hawaiian music on the soundtrack gave the film authenticity and added a lot to the mood of the story, especially in the more melancholic elements that are enhanced by it. Payne directs with his usual wit and warmth.Payne's script is a large part of 'The Descendants' success. There is a lot of poignant pathos that does give enough depth to the melancholic element of the story, but it is balanced beautifully with a sincere honesty, thoughtfulness, glowing warmth and humorous comic elements.Admittedly the story is deliberate and it's not the most insightful or breaking-new-ground there is, but the sympathetic tackling of the heavy and complicated personal themes really strikes an emotional chord and the warmth and gentle tone make it interesting. The characters are written well and the father and daughter relationship has a lot of heart and one of the film's biggest strengths.George Clooney gives one of his finest performances in a challenging role that he brings a lot of layers to. The performance of Shailene Woodley is similarly among the year's best yet criminally overlooked, a very heartfelt, engaging and beyond her years turn. The rest of the cast are just as affecting (particularly Judy Greer and Beau Bridges), while there's welcome levity from Nick Krause, as one of the more rounded supporting characters, and a surprisingly good Matthew Lillard (was expecting him to jar seeing as he tends to play goofballs yet here in a less likeable role in a gentle drama).Overall, very good and could have been great with just a few tweaks. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
Argo,2012,7.7,"Acting under the cover of a Hollywood producer scouting a location for a science fiction film, a CIA agent launches a dangerous operation to rescue six Americans in Tehran during the U.S. hostage crisis in Iran in 1979.","Ben Affleck continues hitting them out of the park. Based on a true story, Argo re-enacts the events that freed American foreign service employees from their hideout in the Canadian Embassy. The setup involves Affleck's character, Mendes, putting together the cover story of a Canadian film crew scouting locations in the Mideast for a sci-fi movie. Alan Arkin & John Goodman are hilarious as Hollywood hotshots producing this surefire scifi hit. The process follows Mendes as he enters Iran and has to BS his way to some skeptical and hostile Iranian theocrats who almost don't know how to respond to the possibility of a scifi movie set in Iran. Mendes must also deal with frightened and reluctant Americans who are being forced out in the open to pose as a movie crew. Affleck does a good job of injecting suspense and dread all through this section.But the real nail biter is their exit from Iran. As in other movies of this ilk, the chase heats up with the Iranians on the heels of the Americans. Affleck throws into this chase a huge boulder of an obstacle when President Carter pulls the plug on the film crew ex-filtration & decides to go with Delta soldiers instead. If you want to know what happens, I advise you to see the movie or read the news accounts.This just goes to show you that not all CIA covert actions are led by armed fighters like Jason Bourne and launched by the Treadstone department. Affleck's character doesn't even carry a gun--he carries a script instead."
Fantastic Four,2005,5.7,"A group of astronauts gain superpowers after a cosmic radiation exposure and must use them to oppose the plans of their enemy, Doctor Victor Von Doom.","Reviewers say 'Fantastic Four' offers a mixed experience with themes of fun, family, and superhero origins. Positive feedback includes enjoyable moments, solid performances, and impressive special effects. However, criticisms point to a weak plot, poor pacing, and lackluster acting. Many feel the film falls short of the comic's potential, particularly in its portrayal of characters like Doctor Doom, deemed inaccurate and uninspired. Despite these flaws, some find it entertaining for a casual viewing."
L'√©cume des jours,2013,6.5,"Wealthy, inventive bachelor Colin endeavors to find a cure for his lover Chloe after she's diagnosed with an unusual illness caused by a flower growing in her lungs.","First of all, i must admit that I didn't read the book. So perhaps that's the reason I didn't get the purpose of this film.I was attending this movie with great expectations, I love the work of Michel Gondry and I couldn't wait to see Audrey Tatou and Omar Sy playing together.The special effects were great, and as I said before Michel Gondry is one of my favorites. But here's the thing, I was unhappy during the movie. I couldn't develop sympathy for the main characters, because the storyline felt missing too often. Combine that with the weird dialogs and the straying from one scene to another without a proper connection, you'll get why. The dialog, and I understand that this was adopted from the book, but in this movie it just didn't made sense.I couldn't feel what I wanted to feel about this movie, I wanted to like it so badly but I couldn't. I feel the film was more focused on the special effects than on the actual character development and storyline."
Chariots of Fire,1981,7.1,"Two British track athletes, one a determined Jew and the other a devout Christian, are driven to win in the 1924 Olympics as they wrestle with issues of pride and conscience.","This is the story of two men who run to prove something to the world . They will sacrifice anything to achieve their goals , except their honor . Two young men fighting for their objectives , one a determined Jew Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) and the other a devout Christian (Ian Charleson) . In a warmup 100 meter race, Scottish Eric defeats Harold, who hires a pro coacher (Ian Holm) to prepare him . After that , both compete in the 1924 Olympics where their courage and determination to be tested . Eric Liddell , whose qualifying heat is scheduled for a Sunday, denies to run despite pressure from the Olympic committee formed by high authorities (Nigel Davenport , Patrick Magee , David Yelland as Prince of Wales) . Eric and Harold win their respective races and go on to achieve fame as missionary and businessman/athletic advocate, respectively . In fact , during the Japanese occupation of China, Eric as a missionary was taken into the Japanese Weihsien internment Camp, where he was to die from a brain tumour just before the camp was liberated.This is is a sensitive as well as riveting story, being told in flashback , dealing with two young British sprinters , competing for fame in the 1924 Olympics , both of them compellingly performed by Ben Cross and the early deceased Ian Charleson . About six years after the film's release, Trinity College reenacted the quad dash with British Olympic athletes Steve Ovett and Sebastian Coe taking part.This marvelous film has an all-star-cast such as Ben Cross ,Ian Charleson , Nigel Havers , Ian Holm , Cheryl Campbell and Alice Krige . Great secondary cast formed by prestigious British players and with a number of well known USA and UK performers for the tiny cameo roles such as John Gielgud ,Nigel Davenport , Lindsay Anderson , Patrick Magee , Peter Egan , Richard Griffiths and uncredited Kenneth Branagh as Cambridge student , Stephen Fry and first cinema film of Nicholas Farrell . Brad Davis and Dennis Christopher appeared as a favor to producer David Puttnam, waiving their fees, in order to attract finance from backers who wanted ""marquee names"" .

When the athletes are running off the beach , in reality it results to be West Sands at St Andrews in Scotland , they run towards a large red building clearly marked as a hotel ; this is in fact Hamilton hall of residence, a student accommodation hall belonging to the University .Lavishly and luxuriously produced by great producer David Puttnam , he was looking for a story in the mold of A man for eternity (1966), regarding someone who follows their conscience ; he felt sports provided clear situations in this sense, and happened upon the story by accident while thumbing through an Olympic reference book in a rented house in Los Angeles , then the screenwriter Colin Welland took out advertisements in London newspapers seeking memories of the 1924 Olympics.Film debut by filmmaker Hugh Hudson , he originally wanted Vangelis' 1977 tune ""L'Enfant"", from his 1979 'Opera Sauvage' album, to be the title theme of the film, and the beach running sequence was actually filmed with ""L'Enfant"" playing in the background for the runners to listen and pace to. Vangelis, however, finally convinced Hudson he could create a new and better piece for the film's main theme - and when he played the new and now-familiar ""Chariots of Fire"" theme for Hudson, it was agreed the new tune was unquestionably better. But the ""L'Enfant"" tune still made it into the film : When the athletes reach Paris and enter the stadium, a brass band marches through the field, and first plays a modified, acoustic performance of ""L'Enfant"" . Vangelis's electronic ""L'Enfant"" track eventually was used prominently in the film The years of living dangerously (1982). The picture deservedly won Academy Awards for Colin Welland's screenplay , Vangelis' magnificent soundtrack , Mila Canonero's costumes and Best picture ."
Kelly's Heroes,1970,7.6,A group of U.S. soldiers sneaks across enemy lines in WWII France to get their hands on a secret stash of Nazi treasure.,"Utterly hilarious World War II adventure picture, with some great acting by all of the leads, fine action sequences and superb scenery.Kelly (Clint Eastwood) captures a German colonel (David Hurst), who inadvertently tells him where the Germans are hiding $16,000,000 worth of gold bars. Kelly enlists the aid of his platoon to trek behind the German lines and steal the cash.The movie features a top-notch cast of veterans and would-be stars. Eastwood (THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY) has a quiet, serious role and floats through the entire picture. Telly Savalas (PANCHO VILLA) makes a great counterpart as the loud, short-tempered and cynical platoon sergeant. Donald Sutherland (THE EAGLE HAS LANDED) steals the show, though, in a very offbeat role as a hippie-style tank commander. He delivers some utterly 60s dialog with great style and is uproarious. Don Rickles is funny, too, in a smaller role as Crapgame - a rear-echelon supply clerk who goes along on the trek for a profit and gets more than he bargains for. Carroll O'Connor (THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE) has an un-necessary but zany role as General Colt, a blustering officer who can't understand why his red-blooded American soldiers aren't cutting through the German army. The role is obviously a knockoff of George C. Scott in PATTON, and O'Connor does an excellent job.The supporting cast is fine, too, though not many make much of an impact. Jeff Morris is a hoot as Cowboy, a transplanted Texas hick, with Harry Dean Stanton in support as his sidekick; Stuart Margolin is a jittery radio operator; Len Lesser is a construction officer who gets conned into going along to build a bridge for the guys, and ends getting really screwed over by Kelly's boys; Hal Buckley is the platoon commander who only cares about getting his yacht to Paris; Gene Collins is the baby-faced youngster. David Hurst is lovable as the dim-witted German colonel, and it's really a shame he gets killed - especially by one of his own tanks. Karl Otto Alberty (THE GREAT ESCAPE) has a nice, small role near the end as a Tiger tank commander, and there's an anti-war spin when Kelly and crew let him escape unscathed. Watch for John G. Heller (OPERATION CROSSBOW) as the German patrol leader during the minefield scene.The movie also features some terrific action scenes. The minefield debacle is suspenseful and nail-biting, and eventually filled with tons of gunfire and neat explosions. The final battle, in which the dozen or so heroes manage to wipe out a garrison of Germans in a small French village is expertly filmed, with some great camerawork and lots of good, convincing special effects. Some major aspects of this sequence were ripped off in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN - Tiger tanks in the street, a sniper in a bell tower, machine gunners firing from bombed-out buildings - the whole general look of the sequence was completely conned.The Lalo Schiffrin score is light-hearted fun, and Mike Curb Congregation's ""Burning Bridges"" theme is a good song but doesn't at all fit the theme of the movie. The film was shot in Yugoslavia to take advantage of lower production costs. It actually looks a lot like central France, with plenty of hedgerows, bombed out buildings and such - nothing like the mountains and rivers of THE BATTLE OF NERETVA.I saw this movie on Turner Classic Movies, appropriately letterboxed at about 2.35:1 with hardly a flaw in the print. Colors are accurate and the image is pretty sharp. TNT used to play an awful, orange-looking print of the movie (with the dialog edited to pieces, also) The audio is fine and sounds clear and loud, but the gunfire and explosions lack intensity. The film is also available on DVD.KELLY'S HEROES is a witty, lighthearted WWII adventure which I don't think any fan can miss. If you need to sit back and watch American GIs kick German butt for 2 and a half hours for a goal as lofty as pure, all-American greed then this is your flick."

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,2002,6.6,"Ten years after initially meeting, Anakin Skywalker shares a forbidden romance with Padm√© Amidala, while Obi-Wan Kenobi discovers a secret clone army crafted for the Jedi.","Right this is my first review, so don't slam down on me to hard! anyway... I've read a lot of comments about petty-problems with this film, but couldn't help thing'what the hell!,' this is a fun movie.First, a plot summery, Padme Amidarla is mow a senator for Naboo who deeply believes in democracy, and i travelling to couresant to vote 'no' for a Republic army.

Superman Returns,2006,6.1,"Superman returns to Earth after spending five years in space examining his homeworld Krypton. But he finds things have changed while he was gone, and he must once again prove himself important to the world.","Reviewers say 'Superman Returns' is lauded for its nostalgic elements, Brandon Routh and Kevin Spacey's performances, and special effects. Yet, it faces criticism for slow pacing, an underdeveloped plot, and lack of chemistry between leads. Inconsistencies in the storyline and Kryptonite use are noted. Despite these issues, the film is appreciated for its effort to revive the franchise and its homage to original films."
Falling Down,1993,7.6,An ordinary man frustrated with the various flaws he sees in society begins to psychotically and violently lash out against them.,"Falling Down (1993)Tagged as `the adventures of an ordinary man at war with the everyday world,' Joel Schumacher's `Falling Down' tells the tragic tale of William Foster aka D-FENS, a now unemployed defense worker who finds himself trapped on a hot summer day in bumper-to-bumper Los Angeles traffic. Having been pushed past the brink of sanity, Foster loses it and storms out of his car, walking around town and trying desperately to see his little daughter for her birthday, a daughter who is untouchable because of a court order against him by his estranged wife. Along the way, Foster will run across character types we've all come across: the 'war veteran' bum who is really just a lowlife looking to score some quick cash, an irate Korean grocery store owner, a homophobic neo-nazi army retail store owner, a crusty elitist country club golf player, super friendly fast food workers, young Hispanic thugs, and so forth. And each one will chip away at what remains of his patience and tolerance for stupidity, fueling a rampage.Up against this anti-hero is Prendergast, a veteran cop who has felt many of the same pains as Foster, but who serves as sort of a foil to him. Foster has lost everything, and while Prendergast has lost quite a bit (his wife is a basketcase, his little daughter died years ago under mysterious circumstances), he still retains some optimism, calmness, and dignity. As Prendergast, who is on his last day on the job, begins to put together the pieces of the mysterious crime spree plaguing the city (he seems to be the only one smart enough to figure out it's all the doing of one man!), it pits him in an inevitable confrontation between him and Foster.Michael Douglas, playing Foster / D-FENS plays an incredibly complex character. On the one hand, you know much of what he does is so wrong, but at the same time there's immense satisfaction at seeing him lash out at those deserving of it. And while he tries to stay calm, he finds himself constantly provoked by those who have 'wronged society.' In fact, many of the things he does could so easily have been avoided if the 'victims' were not so positively despicable. You can't help but feel at the end of the day, when Foster gets his due, that he's, in some small way, made Los Angeles a better place despite the carnage he's unleashed.And this is perhaps what is so strange about the movie. There seems to be no clear message. Who was right? Who was wrong? It becomes a very blurry line over the approximately 2 hours of the movie's run. I've seen it now several times and I still can't give any definitive answer. Perhaps this is a strength, that different people will view this movie in different ways. Some will see this as the story of a noble, decent man who modern society has beaten down and crushed, and who desperately tries to struggle against the tyranny and betrayal. Others will see Foster as a lunatic who needed to be put down. No one, I think, will find that Foster doesn't warrant some sympathy.Personally, I think Foster got the wrong end of the stick. His wife's anger and fear of him seems somewhat unwarranted, and though it is clear that Foster (and not just society itself) has brought many of his problems upon his own head, he is tired and angry and rightfully resentful at the course his life has taken. He feels he has nothing to live for, so he takes it out on anyone who crosses his path. I recommend this movie because the performances are all-around great, it delivers a solid cast, and as the portrayal of one man's journey down the path of madness, few have done better.Grade: A-"
Face/Off,1997,7.3,"To foil a terrorist plot, an FBI agent assumes the identity of the criminal who murdered his son via facial transplant surgery, but the crook wakes up prematurely and vows revenge.","Face\off is the REAL masterpiece by John Woo (at least among his movies directed in the USA). It's spectacular, touching, tough and strongly directed.Here there are a bunch of references to all his precedent movies, in particular to ""The Killer"" and ""Hard Boiled"" , with all  their  poetic in those long shoot-out which look like classical ballets, in that hyperbolic violence which actually is self ironic, in that kung-fu fights derived by Hong Kong film industry.Eventually John Travolta and overall Nicholas Cage perfectly play the ""literary"" theme of doubles. 9\10 without second thoughts."
The Butterfly Effect,2004,7.6,"Evan Treborn suffers blackouts during significant events of his life. As he grows up, he finds a way to remember these lost memories and a supernatural way to alter his life by reading his journal.","THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT- THEATRICAL CUT (4 outta 5 stars)THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT- DIRECTOR'S CUT (3+ outta 5 stars)Now normally I tend to prefer movies that let the writer/director tell the story that they want to without having to water it down for mass consumption. In this case I have to say that the ending they they were forced to re-shoot for the theatrical release of this movie is a much more emotional, resonant and appropriate ending than the bleak, cold and grotesque finale they had originally planned. On the US DVDs you get the choice of which version to see (foreign editions only have the less compelling director's version)... so North American viewers can make up their own mind about which ending they prefer. I would suggest watching the theatrical cut first... and then check out the director's cut... which would you prefer to think of as the ""real"" ending?As for the movie itself... don't be put off by the idea of Ashton Kutcher in the lead role. He does quite a good job in a serious part quite different from his usual TV persona. He plays a college student who, having been plagued by mental blackouts all his life, devotes himself to the study of human memory. Eventually he finds that by re-reading old journal entries he can will himself back in time to experience the events he had blacked out... and even CHANGE THEM using the knowledge that his older self possesses. Unfortunately one small change in the past causes some HUGE ramifications in his present day world. Can't say too much more about the plot without giving away the many fun surprises. Believable performances and a basic seriousness give the film an urgency that is sometimes missing in modern fantasy films of this type."
As Good as It Gets,1997,7.7,"A single mother and waitress, a misanthropic author, and a gay artist form an unlikely friendship after the artist is assaulted in a robbery.","""You make me want to be a better man.""I finally got around to watching this touching and funny film directed by James L. Brooks that stands out thanks to some wonderful performances and memorable characters. As Good As it Gets is proof that actions are louder than words because despite how cruel and mean Nicholson's character is, he does incredible and kind things for others. In a way this film reminded me of David O. Russell's Silver Linings Playbook as I found both films to be difficult to follow at first due to the lack of a likable character, but once we get to know who these people are we forgive their flaws and end up routing for them. Both Nicholson and Helen Hunt give excellent performances, and their Oscar wins were well deserved in my opinion. As Good As it Gets is the very definition of charm, and the screenplay written by Mark Andrus (Life As a House) shines thanks to some incredible performances. I really enjoyed this film and found myself laughing through most of the scenes. This is one more film I can eliminate from my shame list, and I'm glad I finally got to experience this romantic comedy which also has a lot to say about overcoming illness.We are introduced to Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson), a cranky but successful author who suffers from OCD. He lives on his own in a beautiful apartment where he spends most of his time writing. He always goes out on his daily breakfast ritual which consists of walking to a nearby cafe without touching anyone or stepping on any cracks. He always sits in the same place at the cafe and always demands to be served by the same waitress, whose name is Carol (Helen Hunt). Carol is actually the only one in the cafe who stands his constant outbursts and cruel comments. Melvin's daily routine changes through two events that end up affecting his life. First, his homosexual artist neighbor named Simon (Greg Kinnear) suffers an accident and Melvin unwillingly accepts to take care of his dog in his absence. Second, Carol's son, Spencer (Jesse James) gets ill and she quits her job. Not accepting the fact that Carol isn't there to serve him, Melvin tries to find her in order to restore order back to his life. These series of events force Melvin to change his routine and at the same time he forms an unlikely friendship with Carol and Simon proving that he isn't as bad as he seems to be.The performances by each one of the talented actors are the heart and motor of this film. Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt share an incredible chemistry together. It's funny how despite never being able to share his feelings towards her and always saying the wrong things, it becomes clear that she does inspire him to become a better person. The supporting cast is also incredible here, especially Greg Kinnear and Cuba Gooding Jr. who deliver several funny scenes. I was partial to Brooks's work considering I had only seen How Do You Know which didn't work for me and Spanglish which I did enjoy, but As Good As it Gets is without a doubt his best work thanks to an unbelievable cast. This is a smart and funny film, which also could be cruel at times, but it was well balanced. Despite the schmaltzy story it still worked thanks to the characters that carried this film. It's hard not to leave this film with a smile on your face."
The Ring,2002,7.1,A journalist must investigate a mysterious videotape which seems to cause the death of anyone one week to the day after they view it.,"I first watched this movie with a couple of friends. To be honest, I was expecting a teenage, slasher flick, I was proved wrong.The film circles around a cursed videotape that causes it's viewers to die in seven days. Investigative journalist, Rachel Keller, begins to uncover the secrets of the videotape, and must race against the clock to save herself.The movie was very unsettling and disturbing, which worked more effectively than some teens getting slashed with axes. The videotape was nightmarish and disturbing, and the images will stay with you long after the movie. The setting was gloomy and atmospheric, which enhanced the mood. Naomi Watts portrayed Rachel perfectly, her emotions are believable and haunting.So if you are looking for a horror flick to watch on Friday night, be sure to watch The Ring, just make sure to watch it at night with the lights off."
The Grudge,2004,5.9,"An American nurse living and working in Tokyo is exposed to a mysterious supernatural curse, one that locks a person in a powerful rage before claiming their life and spreading to another victim.","so, being a fairly deep fan of horror movies, it's been a while since i've seen one that really made me jump (or fidget nervously.)definitely going to get this on DVD when it comes out... a hell of a lot better than the ring. the thing that i don't get is that so many people that we talkd with after the movie thought that it was horrible, well, if that's what you think, then so be it... i know what i liked and it takes a fair amount to get me to actually feel scared, so i have to say that this one is worth watching.now, you might be disappointed in the story if you need everything in a neat and tidy line, because the plot goes back an forth a little bit to help build the story (i think that if it was shown in chronological order, it would have ruined the whole thing.)i'm actually glad that this movie had very little bloody messes in it... maybe the rest of you studio writers and whathaveyous will realize that you don't have to splash the red stuff all over the set to make people afraid."
De Hobbit: Een onverwachte reis,2012,7.8,"A reluctant Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, sets out to the Lonely Mountain with a spirited group of dwarves to reclaim their mountain home and the gold within it from the dragon Smaug.","I Remember the first time i watched this movie in the cinema and i did not like it as much i thought i would! Maybe it was because my hopes were very high after LOTR and while this movie gad elements from that, it didn't reach the same level in terms of story and visuals!Jacksons overuse of CGI sometimes pull me out of it, but its not as bad as the third movie, which almost gives me headaches!But over the time i have learned to like the movie and look past its flaws! Compared to the first season of Rings of Power this movie is deffinetely not bad, and does a better job of conveying a story with characters you care about! When it comes to the source material this movie doesn't drag as much as the others! The scenes with gollum are ""hands down"" the best part of the movie!Overall a great fantasy experience that still excists in the shadow of its predecacors but entertains none the less!"
Winter's Bone,2010,7.1,An unflinching Ozark Mountain girl hacks through dangerous social terrain as she hunts down her drug-dealing father while trying to keep her family intact.,"It is quite astonishing what people are capable of when their survival or way of life is threatened. In those moments, they are somehow able to employ a level of courage, perseverance, and high intention that they never knew they had. Such is the case for young Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) in Debra Granik's The Winter's Bone, winner of the Jury Prize for dramatic competition as well as the Waldo Salt Screen writing Award at the Sundance Film Festival. Newcomer Lawrence, a Kentucky native, is completely convincing as the 17-year-old Ree who has endured much in her brief lifetime and has plenty of obstacles yet to overcome. Living in poverty in a small house in the rural Missouri Ozarks, near the Arkansas border, she has to cook, chop wood and do whatever is necessary to care for her twelve-year old brother Sonny (Isaiah Stone) and her six-year old sister Ashlee (Ashlee Thompson) as well as look after her mother who is catatonic.Based on the novel by Daniel Woodrell and co-written by Granik and Anne Rosellini, The Winter's Bone depicts how young Ree's life is changed when the local sheriff informs her that her dad, Jessup, on the run after being arrested for ""cooking"" methamphetamines, has put the family's house up as bond and that, unless he is found and convinced to turn himself in, Ree's family will lose their house. Insisting to the sheriff that she will find him, the young girl begins a search among friends, family members, distant relatives, and the community of small-time crooks, dope dealers, and kingpins that dominate the male-dominated rural society. No one wants to talk and Ree is met with silence, hostility, and even violence. One neighbor tells her that her questioning is, ""a real good way to end up et by hogs."" When someone asks her, ""Ain't you got no men folk to do this?"" the answer is an emphatic ""no."" (at times, the film seems to be challenging Juno for the most quirky one-liners).Ree's main antagonists are her father's terrifying older brother Teardrop, played by John Hawkes, and Merab (Dale Dickey), the wife of Thump Milton, one of the local bosses. The performance by Dickey conveys an overbearing sense of intimidation that is both real and frightening. As Ree navigates through this hostile environment, we grow to admire her determination and her willingness to confront danger in order to protect her siblings. Winter's Bone is a film about poverty and desperation but it never exploits its characters or engages in manipulation or sentimentality. Though it can be hard to watch at times, it is not as some critics have said ""poverty porn."" There are lighter moments as well that include authentic Ozark folk music sung by Marideth Sisco and scenes of Ree teaching her brother and sister to spell, count, and perhaps more important for survival, how to shoot a rifle. She also tells her younger brother about the culture in which they live saying ""Never ask for what ought to be offered.""Though I was riveted by the unfolding story, perhaps because of the film's high degree of stylization, I stopped short of full emotional involvement and was often conscious of the fact that I was watching a movie. Yet The Winter's Bone is a rich, satisfying film that more than deserves the accolades it has been receiving. Though it is stylized, it has an authenticity derived from using local residents as actors and from the director having immersed herself in the culture for two years before shooting the film. Jennifer Lawrence conveys a stoic and hard-edged individual, yet one with integrity who has somehow avoided getting sucked into the soul destructive way of life that seems to be endemic to the area. In Ree, Granik has created one of the strongest female characters in cinema in memory, one who, by her sheer will, suggests what could be accomplished if all of us could live each day as if our life depended on it."
Trance,2013,6.9,An art auctioneer mixed up with a group of criminals partners with a hypnotherapist in order to recover a lost painting.,"The first 40 minutes, I was excited & impressed. I like James McAvoy, I think he's a really good & charismatic actor. And Vincent Cassel, in my opinion, always delivers. The movie pumps you up with an intriguing storyline, flashy & artsy camera shots & angles, thrilling scenes backed up with a really good musical score. Then enter Rosario Dawson. It has been a steady downward spiral from that point on. No, it's not because of her, although I thought she looked a bit tired 90 % of the film. It's the plot and the shameful use of hypnotherapy as the driving force of the whole movie. Hypnotherapy as the structure of the movie? That makes the plot shaky at best. The moment Rosario inserted herself in the scheme I found myself shaking my head more and more.Trance almost had everything that makes a movie work. Good cast, great direction, interesting cameraworks, good editing, stylish neo-noir execution, and really great music. Unfortunately, like poor Tin Man without the heart and The Lion without courage, this one has a weak script which essentially takes away the soul of the movie. It's a classic case of style-over-substance, easily disguised as a mind-bending intellectual movie with the use of ""is this real?"" sequences, change of perspective, and thrill rides, that can masterfully dupe the audience into thinking that they're watching Leo with a Spotless Mind.Danny Boyle has style, that's for sure, but he should have given equal attention to the plot as he did to his camera shots & artsy vibe of the whole film. It's not at all bad, the music and style is enough reason to enjoy this movie and send you in a 100-minute trance-like state, but after the credits roll, like a snap of a finger, you wake up after that trippy ride, shake your head, look around, and mutter, ""Seriously?"""
Noises Off...,1992,7.4,A traveling theater group find so much action going on behind the scenes that they almost ruin the performances.,"""Noises Off"" is based on a popular play. Directed by Peter Bogdonavich, it tells the story of a bedroom farce, ""Nothing On,"" which is, in fact, a dud of a play - and what goes on backstage and on-stage as the actors rehearse, play out of town, and open on Broadway. Thanks to break-ups, jealousies, and drunkenness, the offstage happenings spill over into the play, as the actors grow to hate one another more and more. Anyone with experience in theater will love it the most, but it's fun for everyone.The cast is top-notch - Michael Caine is the harried director, and the stars of the ""play"" are Carol Burnett, John Ritter, Christopher Reeve, Marilu Henner, Nicolette Sheridan, Mark-Linn Baker, and Denholm Elliott. Julie Hagerty is the near-hysterical stage manager.There's a lot of slapstick and much ""actor talk"" with the actors searching for motivations; there's a drunk actor (Elliott) who pops up from time to time asking if it's his cue yet. (Soon, the cast finds his stash of booze and start chugalugging themselves.) Caine is terrific as a Valium-popping director driven to near-madness.The play is much better than the film, even though the film is terribly funny.Unfortunately, for me anyway, it's just terribly sad to see handsome, robust Christopher Reeve walking around and the talented, deceased John Ritter. Boy, life sure has some same twists. So does ""Noises Off"" - but unlike some of life's twists, these twists are accompanied by plenty of belly laughs."
Taxi,,7.7,The staff of a New York City taxicab company go about their job while they dream of greater things.,"Funny thing, I never watched 'Taxi' during its initial run during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Something about the title, I never got past that. However, during its re-runs during the 1990s I became an enthusiastic fan. I taped all the episodes so I could watch them at my convenience (I didn't save them, so don't ask). It became like watching a 'family', much as did my other favorite, 'Northern Exposure.' Both series had a common quality, set in an unusual place, with quirky characters and meaningful stories, so that during each episode you actually begin to care for each one. Who could ever forget Alex Rieger, Louie De Palma, Elaine Nardo, Tony Banta, Latka Gravas, Simka, and my all-time favorite character, Christopher Lloyd as Reverend Jim Ignatowski.  I like that he took the name 'Ignatokski' because it was 'flower child' spelled backwards! (If you don't get it, then you will never 'get it.')A few of my favorite moments come to mind ...Jim burns Louie's apartment. Jim discovers that ""I must have had piano lessons..."" Jim works all the overtime he can to buy ... a dozen TV sets, achieving his greatest goal in life. The moment in college, when Jim takes one bite of a brownie, and he becomes what we know as the kookie Ignatowski.I'll think of many more after I post these comments!!  A great TV series, maybe it will come out on DVD some day."
The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus,2009,6.7,"Having made a deal with the Devil himself for immortality many millennia ago, the now decrepit mystic Doctor Parnassus fights for the freedom of his only daughter's soul.","I found this film interesting and visually stunning, but flawed. At least one of the flaws cannot be attributed to faulty writing/production, but several others can be. For example, there is nothing new or original in the story: it is a straightforward retelling of Faust, the man who makes a pact with the devil and discovers that the devil is smarter and has all the time in the universe to prove it. The ideas of a man who asks for immortality but neglects to ask for eternal youth, and of a child born with a curse on her because of a prior wager her father has made with divine powers to further his own interests, are taken straight out of Greek mythology. Still, one could do worse than borrow from Goethe and Greek mythology.The movie weaves in and out of mundane reality (the traveling freak show in modern England) and schizophrenic hallucinogenic scenes inside the Imaginarium, which is the carnival attraction into which Dr. P lures potential sacrificial victims in his attempt to outwit the devil. The scenes inside the Imaginarium show what happens when you give an ex-Python unlimited access to digital effects: quite stunning, but having little to do with the story. They show the fantasy of Gilliam running wild on a huge budget, more than effectively advancing the story of Dr. P and his accursed daughter. I ask myself what a 1930s producer/director, Fritz Lang or Tod Browning for example, might have done with this story and these characters, but without the digital effects- -the story might have benefited from leaving the hallucinogenic details more to the imagination of the viewer than brow-beating us with a pixel- barrage of details. The real horror of what Dr. P is doing is masked by the almost Dr. Seussian silliness of the visual effects (dancing policemen??): Dr. P is luring souls to eternal damnation in an attempt to free his daughter from a wager he made centuries ago. Dr. P is, in essence, trading in human souls. Dr. P himself is immortal, but his daughter is not, and time is running out for her; the horror of her situation, and the evil Dr. P is willing to perpetrate to undo the effects of his own damnable wager, could certainly have been ratcheted up by more subtle means than Gilliam employs here.The reality scenes sometimes interweave with the fantastical ones in schizophrenic confusion, indicating, so I suppose, Dr. P's own tenuous grasp on reality. The schizophrenic quality of the film is enhanced by the fact that several different actors play the part of one of the main characters, Tony. I ask myself whether any producer/director would have chosen this as his preferred mechanism to unfold this story, and the answer I come up with is, ""no"". It is a trick which doesn't quite work for this story; though it did work for ""I'm Not There"" (no one could play Bob Dylan). The film just barely manages to make the trick plausible by implying that the differences in the character's appearance are due to the perspectives of the different people who perceive that character within the Imaginarium. OK, it was made necessary by the death of the actor in the middle of production, otherwise the film would not have gone public; I can see that Gilliam made the best of terribly unfortunate circumstances. But it is still a dubious trick.The casting is excellent: Plummer is entirely convincing as the world- weary Faustian character, Miss Cole acquits herself well as the girl clueless as to her own impending doom, and Waits is superb as the devil. If I hadn't seen any other film with Heath Ledger in it, I would not have thought him an especially gifted actor based solely on this performance; maybe if he had completed the film, it would have shown his true abilities.6/10"
Looper,2012,7.4,"In 2074, when the mob wants to get rid of someone, the target is sent into the past, where a hired gun awaits - someone like Joe - who one day learns the mob wants to 'close the loop' by sending back Joe's future self for assassination.","Looper is an exciting and mentally stimulating science fiction movie that goes above and beyond in the realm of creativity. Original and thought provoking in its execution, this is a movie about time travel with a future that is gritty, plausible, and fantastic to absorb.Taking its cues from hard hitting gangster movies, the story follows Joe, a young man living in 2044 America that is crippled with economic collapse. He works for the mafia as a ""looper"". This is a job that requires some explanation. You see, 30 years from 2044, time travel will be invented. It is highly illegal, but is used by the mob to dump bodies, because it is impossible to do so in the future-future. Loopers get set times and places where they wait for their victims to appear, bound, gagged, and with a mask over their head. Sometimes a looper ends up killing himself from the future. This begins happening quite often, and rumor has it that a man named the Rain Maker is ordering the killings of all loopers. Joe does not seem to think much of this until his future self arrives, without a mask on. His future self escapes, looking for the child who will one day become the Rain Maker. Young Joe finds a woman and her young, troubled boy who are one of the people on Old Joe's map. He decides to wait there to confront his older self, to try and make things right with the mob.The movie twists and turns in unexpected ways that create a true feeling of suspense. Rian Johnson takes major influences from the likes of Martin Scorsese to craft a cold and calculating crime film. However, Johnson makes a movie that is so original and eclectic that it is obvious this is the work of a man who knows how to tell a story. There is plenty of action, but it never becomes more important than the story or the characters. Johnson also wrote the script, and he brings humanity to all of the players involved. The introduction of alternate timelines is only the beginning of the insane subplots that pop up, and all fit nicely together. The gritty and subdued style invokes a noir aspect that only serves to enhance the movie.Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays young Joe. He is fantastic as the cool, calm, and collected gunman. His face is altered with makeup to make him look more like old Joe, played by Bruce Willis. Levitt even speaks like the action star. Willis is really great in a subdued and complicated performance, although it would have been nice for his character to have had a more expanded role; he seems to fall into the role of the antagonist too quickly. Emily Blunt plays the hardened and self reliant mother of the boy old Joe is hunting. Blunt's character is used well and she gives an excellent performance.Looper is a bizarre movie, and that is a very good thing. Exciting, thoughtful, and at times disturbing, this film is mesmerizing to watch. It's not often that an action film is even half as good as this one, and rarely are movies so much fun to watch.thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com"
Rambo,2008,7.0,"In Thailand, John Rambo joins a group of mercenaries to venture into war-torn Burma, and rescue a group of Christian aid workers who were kidnapped by the ruthless local infantry unit.","Rambo is an 80s-style action movie with modern sensibilities. Stallone is not a one-man army as in previous movies but rather a dogged old soldier that comes to terms with what he actually is while racking up a body count that would make Tarintino proud. In many ways, this movie parallels Rocky Balboa as a mature ending to a series of sometimes over-the-top but fun action movies. John Rambo in this movie is an aging but potent killing machine that for the first time since First Blood accomplishes his mission in a very believable manner. The action is visceral and downright gory at times surpassing the hard-core scenes of Omaha Beach in Saving Private Ryan. The film pulls no punches when showing exactly what a Barret .50 caliber sniper rifle can do to a human body. Stallone mutters only a very few lines of dialog in this movie... there's no speeches or patriotic flag waving going on here but there is a clear lesson on how well liberal idealism holds up under barbaric realities amid genocide and war.A must see but not one for the kiddies."
Australia,2008,6.6,"In 1939, an Englishwoman inherits a sprawling ranch in northern Australia and reluctantly makes a pact with a stockman to drive 2000 head of cattle over unforgiving landscape.","Australia came out between Christmas and New Year in the UK and this was quite befitting it as this is the time when the television usually has those fluffy but expensive specials and epic productions clogging it up, all with the excuse of being perfect ""doze in front of the telly"" stuff for the wake of eating too much. I say this fits Australia because in truth much of Baz Luhrmann's film could be accused of being just that ¬ñ bloated, silly, sweeping, moving, engaging but ultimately quite light in the substance department. Our story is an traditional ""epic"" romance in the mould of many old films where the rough hero and the cut-glass woman fall for one another against a backdrop of cattle drives and war. If alarm bells are ringing for you then they were for me as well, since this concept reminded me a bit of Pearl Harbour ¬ñ that terribly wooden affair that dragged on far too long to be able to cover the problems with big explosions.The good news is that Australia is better than Pearl Harbour. The bad news is that it still isn't a fantastic film so much as it is the type of film that one likes despite it all, not because of it. The film wears its epic feel like a big coat and it covers it completely to the point that there is no denying the ambition of Luhrmann. We get massive spectacle, sweeping emotion, ethnic mysticism and constant unreal cinematography that makes the whole thing look gorgeous to the point of being unreal. In this regard the film works because there is a lot going on and, despite one's reservations, it feels like we are watching this epic film that is important and emotional and creative. The truth is perhaps a little less impressive because the mix of the epic and the fanciful doesn't come off for Luhrmann as well as it has in other films. Here one rather affects the other and the ""big real story"" sits uncomfortably with ""unlikely sweeping narrative gestures"" and ""mystical power of the Aborigine"". To some this will be just part of the magic of the film but for me it got a bit tiresome and felt like too much had been thrown into the pot.That said, it somehow does work and generally I got caught up in the sweep and majesty of the whole thing ¬ñ caring about the characters, touched by the slight magic in the story and the delivery. Although they don't mix that well, the camp style is woven into some aspects to prevent it becoming dry, unlikely and wooden in the way that it did in Pearl Harbour. The direction and cinematography drive this but the cast help. Jackman is not ""great"" in traditional terms but his beefy, chiselled frame plays well to the broad matin√©e idol type that he must deliver as. By contrast Kidman doesn't quite pull it off. Sure she is convincingly dry and uptight at the start but she doesn't loosen in a way that works that well. Walters is a bit too sickly cute for my liking but within the context of Luhrmann's world, he just about works even if he was a bit too front and centre within the film. Brown is a nice find in support and generally everyone is OK for what is required.It is too long and it does have far too much in there for its own good but it just about works. I can understand why some hate it and some love it because it is that type of film but, for all its flaws (and it does have them), the big colourful, emotional sweep of it all is hard to resist. I'll admit that I would be unlikely to watch it again until it comes to TV for free in about 5 years but it has its charm and although it is not perfect I did think it was quite a good film and one that is typically Luhrmann in creation."
About a Boy,2002,7.1,"Will, who attends single parent meetings to woo women, meets Marcus, a troubled 12-year-old boy. As they become friends, Will learns to be responsible while he helps Marcus with his studies.","Described by some as a man's version of Bridget Jones Diary the  remarkable thing is that it lives up to the description. Hugh Grant,  with an excellent script that could have been written especially for  him, plays a young confirmed single yuppie socialite, dividing his day  into units in which to pack his meaningless but carefree, philandering  lifestyle and disposable income. After initially discovering unmarried  mothers as a new supply of grateful sexual objects, he becomes drawn  into a meaningful life after making friends with a young boy. Avoiding  a cheesy ending is one of the film's many triumphs."
Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay,2008,6.5,"After being mistaken for terrorists and thrown into Guant√°namo Bay, stoners Harold and Kumar escape and return to the U.S., where they proceed to flee across the country with federal agents in hot pursuit.","When I watched the first Harold and Kumar, I thought the film was hilarious. Two Asian dudes that goes on a crazy adventure just to get themselves some burgers. Memorable scenes were, Freakshow, Bobby Lee as the student, EEXXXTRRREEEEMMME, the Black guy in jail scenes and beating the Bag of Weed wife.Unlike the first film, I don't think there were such memorable or funny scenes. But does that make the sequel bad? No. Why? Because this time, we have a plot! The quest is not just one linear goal now. The first film had Harold believing in himself and not doing other people's work, whereas Kumar had accepted that he is good at medicine. This second time around, their emotional goal is to grow up and find love.Having hilarious flashbacks, EMO HAROLD, the writers ""plant the seeds"" for what happens later on in the film. And it works effectively. It gives the film a full circle appeal and much more touching than the first film. Neil Patrick Harris cameos in this film again, but I don't think his scenes were that funny. Not as funny as how he humps Harold's driver's seat in the first film.Again, this film really is just a series of gags and racial commentary from start to finish and this time with more boobage. The love story is the icing on the cake which made me enjoy this film more than the first. Not all the scenes were good though, I didn't really find the George Bush scene that funny, but I guess it was written as a device to get keep the story going.So the writers and directors, Hurwitz and Schlossberg, have definitely matured form the first film. At least in their writing, mimicking the Apatow group, IE, 40 yr old virgin, Superbad and Knocked Up, has given the characters more depth instead of just randomness.This film, I would say, has grown from Family Guy to South Park quality. Harold and Kumar are will probably be memorable characters in film history. Whether or not they will make a third movie remains to be seen. The ending closes up nicely, but seeing that they made over $14Mill in their first weekend might say otherwise...3.5/5"
The Ides of March,2011,7.1,A campaign press secretary becomes involved in a scandal that threatens his candidate's election chances.,"George Clooney is running for President. Well, I mean, in ""The Ides of March,"" as Governor Mike Morris, he's running for the Democratic Presidential nomination. He's the good guy and his opponent is the bad guy. Because that's how it is supposed to be, right? The opponent's campaign manager is played by the ever-shady Paul Giamatti, while Morris' campaign is championed by the young, handsome idealistic Stephen (Ryan Gosling).This is about politics, the games people play to get ahead, and the types of people who get played‚Äîthat's the interesting part. The refreshing part, is that this isn't about election night and who is going to win and who is going to lose. A few poll numbers are rattled off, but it's mostly about what is going to happen to our heroes (or anti-heroes) and what are they going to do in response. When you look like Clooney and Gosling, it's hard not to be the hero, but remember, this is politics and nobody is really a hero in that mess.People make mistakes. I enjoyed following Stephen as he struggled internally with his path forward. He believes in the good of the Governor. He's smart and passionate and makes a good campaign manager. His mistakes seem minor and understandable. The problem is, he's 30. He's at the in-between age, where he's half young-college-student-ready-to-take-over-the-world and half experienced-cynic. Those are two very combative halves and when they come at odds within him, the character takes some shocking and drastic turns.The few references to actual political gaffes are obvious and just done for comic relief. All the clever lines are stolen by Giamatti, who, I am predicting, will come away with the only acting nomination for the film. Although, the brilliant character work ‚Äì that's done by everybody, and is what makes ""The Ides of March"" so intriguing."
Harry Potter en de vuurbeker,2005,7.7,"Harry Potter finds himself competing in a hazardous tournament between rival schools of magic, but he is distracted by recurring nightmares.","I did enjoy this movie, but being a huge fan of the books, I was frustrated with a lot of the things that were touched upon, but not really followed though with.First things first, I give Mike Newell and Steve Kloves credit for finally giving Fred and George the screen time they deserve. I'm glad the movie audience finally got to see what truly great characters those two are.Daniel Radcliff and Rupert Grint (Ron saying ""Bloody Hell"" when Hermione woke him up at the beginning was hysterical) play the perfect awkward teenage boys as well. They had great comedic timing in delivering lines and tripping over themselves around girls.Cedric, Cho, Fleur, and Viktor were all perfectly cast, but had too few lines.Alan Rickman, as always was Brilliant as Snape. It was also great to see Professor McGonagall as a more fully developed character. Neville getting more screen time was good as well.Cedric's death and Voldemort's return was very powerful.As far as things that were in and things that were cut, I think that the things that made the film should have been finished on. Like the Quidditch cup, the Stadium and campground were really cool, but why show all that then skip the match. I felt like the filmmakers were shaking a pop can and when they opened it, there was a mere hissing noise.Why put Rita Skeeter in at all if they aren't even going to reveal that she is an animagus? That's important in book five. That would have been a much better way to end the movie than Hermione saying things are going to be different now aren't they? Gee Voldy's back, Captain obvious to the rescue! Oh and Ron's reaction to Fleur kissing him was great, but where was Hermione's jealousy. They put in the post Yule Ball argument, so why not enhance it? It would have taken two seconds to show Hermione's jealousy, and it would have been funny.The wands connecting was important, but the Phoenix song was never explained, and are people who have only seen the movies going to remember the wand core thing from the first movie? And Hermione is a character I feel the filmmakers have not properly interpreted. I mean the Yule ball scene bugged the crap out of me the way she came down with that smug look on her face! Ugh! I liked Hermione better in the book when she was smiling sheepishly, she was just more endearing that way. And her dress and hair made her look more like a five year old playing dress up, as opposed to a blossoming teenager. They should have followed JKR's description when designing the costume. Periwinkle would have been more flattering than pink, IMO.I'm glad Ginny got a wee bit of face time here, but she'd better not get the shaft in the OotP movie, if they give Hermione her lines there, I will be POed.Anyway I did enjoy this movie overall, but being a huge fan of the book, I couldn't help but nitpick, LOL"
Saw II,2005,6.6,A detective and his team must rescue eight people trapped in a factory by a man known as Jigsaw.,"Although this follow-up to the marvellous 2004 thriller 'Saw' is nowhere near as great as the original, it is still a good film worth watching.The ""Jigsaw"" killer plays another sick game with another unlucky group of people. They are placed in a booby-trapped house that is slowly filling up with a lethal nerve gas. They are doomed to die, unless they can find out what they have in common, complete various tasks in the house and find the antidote.Where the original film's gore could be forgiven on the account of its high logic, this lazy sequel is just gore for its own sake. The pace has been slowed down to a snail's and there are fewer scares and twists to keep the viewer as interested. Nevertheless, few viewers will have worked out the final, nasty twist, which makes it all worthwhile."
The Bourne Identity,2002,7.8,"A man is picked up by a fishing boat, bullet-riddled and suffering from amnesia, before racing to elude assassins and attempting to regain his memory.","Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, a highly trained, U.S. spy whose wounded body is found floating in an ocean by a fishing boat. With no memory of who he is and what happened to him, he has to piece together how he came to be shot in the back and left for dead; and most importantly, who and what he is. But Damon must do it fast, as time is running out and the ones he worked for are sending assassins to find him. ""The Bourne Identity"" is top-notch spy movie, filled with action, suspense, and a mystery that is slowly explained as the movie goes on. Matt Damon is well suited for the role, and with the help of fancy editing, he comes off as a martial arts expert who can quickly dispatch multiple foes in a few seconds. The movie moves along very fast, making the near two hour running time feel like it's thirty minutes shorter than it is. Fast pacing and a likable hero (Damon) are two big strengths of this movie that fans of spy/thriller/suspense movies should not miss. My most memorable, movie moment of ""The Bourne Identity"" is the scene when Damon evades the police with an original Mini car! Hey, it's not the car, it's the driver that counts.Mannysmemorablemoviemoment"
Three Kings,1999,7.1,"In the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War, four soldiers set out to steal gold that was stolen from Kuwait, but they discover people who desperately need their help.","In the aftermath of Desert Storm a group of soldiers find a secret map showing a bunker containing Kuwaiti gold.  When they begin to go for the gold they find little resistance from an Iraqi army more concerned with killing civilians than protecting gold.  The uprising had started when the US army had encouraged civilians to rebel but now will not support them.When I first saw the trailer for this I knew nothing about it ¬ñ from the way it was marketed I had assumed it was going to be a modern day `Kelly's Heroes' with bright comedy and good action scenes.  On first viewing I was disappointed but interested.  On second viewing I now see what this film was about and how badly marketed it had been.  The plot is no comedy but is really an extreme anti-war film that condemns America's approach to the Gulf War.When our characters go after the goal they go in a gung-ho manner, seeking only riches and not interested in the plight of the people.  This is how America went in ¬ñ not to protect the people but because of the impact the invasion was having on oil prices and reserves.  The anti-war message is also hammered home in the gross close-up shots of how a bullet damages a body.It's only in the final half hour that the film goes a little wrong ¬ñ looking for an ending that isn't depressing in a subject that really can't have a `happy' ending and please American audiences.  It has other weaknesses ¬ñ some of the scenes are off subject , meaningless or just don't work. However for the majority this is a surprisingly good film that makes points that aren't seen in Hollywood films (and if this whole flag waving thing continues much longer, we won't see a counter opinion for quite a while).The cast are good and deserve praise for choosing this film.  Clooney and Wahlberg both add a large box office draw while for Jonze this made up a great summer of exposure.  Ice Cube again shows that not all rappers have to do rubbish hip hop comedies to get into movies.Overall this was betrayed by it's own marketing department and many people may not have liked it for that reason.  However this is an intelligent anti-war film that has flaws but should be given respect for it's honesty and bravery."
Seeking a Friend for the End of the World,2012,6.7,"As an asteroid nears Earth, a man finds himself alone after his wife leaves in a panic. He decides to take a road trip to reunite with his high school sweetheart. Accompanying him is a neighbor who inadvertently puts a wrench in his plan.","Actually I had expected this to be somewhat more of a comedy, but it turned out to be a much better experience than just another average comedy. ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" turned out to be a very beautiful and emotional movie, with just a pinch of great comedy added to spice it up.The story is about the end of days approaching as an asteroid is bound for Earth, and will destroy the planet upon impact. Dodge (played by Steve Carell) finds himself abandoned by his wife upon this news and tries to go on with his life for the last 21 days before the world comes to end. He gets acquainted with a downstairs neighbor, Penny (played by Keira Knightley) whom he haven't talked with for the past 3 years of living in the same apartment building. These two very different spirits end up on a road trip together to get Dodge to his high school girlfriend and get Penny aboard an airplane for Great Britain. Their journey proves to be more than life changing.The storyline for ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" was really great, and bizarre wonderful in a weird way. There is this whole gloomy downtrodden feel to it as people are trying to cope with coming to terms with life ending within 3 weeks. But at the same time, there is such a strong emotional journey taking place as we follow Dodge and Penny on their path to their destinations. The movie is driven by great characters and by superb acting. There is just the right amount of absurd and dark comedy to this movie that helps build up the right atmosphere.I was genuinely surprised by this movie. I knew that it wouldn't be a horrible movie, because Steve Carell usually delivers great performances and do good comedy. But his deliverance in this movie was just phenomenal. He was so well-cast for this movie. As was Keira Knightley, and their chemistry on the screen was just sizzling.The movie also boasts some rather great cameo appearances, all of whom really helped adding to the movie, by actors and actresses such as Rob Corddry, Patton Oswalt, William Petersen and, of course, Martin Sheen.""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" is a definite to-watch-movie for any movie aficionado, because it is very beautiful and moving in many ways. I am really happy that I sat down to watch this movie. And to top it off, this is the type of movie that leaves you with a parting gift, something to think about; what would you do if you only had 21 days left before the world ended?Oh, and as a final note, if you are prone to tear in beautiful movies, you might keep a tissue at hand for the ending of this movie. Just a word of advice."
Ferris Bueller's Day Off,1986,7.8,"A brash, cocky high school senior, tired of skipping school to spend a boring day at home, is determined to enjoy an epic day roaring around his favorite Chicago sites, enlisting his best friend and girlfriend to join him on the adventure.","Before all the slapstick, before re-writing ""Home Alone"" umpteen times and before selling his soul to ""Disney Pictures Inc."", John Hughes was believed to be THE scribe for teen angst.He wrote eloquently of it in ""Sixteen Candles"", ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Pretty in Pink"". And with ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", he creates a person and a time in life that just about anyone who's ever been a teenager can relate to.Who hasn't known someone like Ferris Bueller (Broderick)? Someone who always has a plan, someone who made loafing off an art form, someone who could fall in a barrel of you-know-what and come out smelling like a rose?All he wants to do is take a day off from school and enjoy the day in Chicago - simple enough, but he must also try and convince his best friend Cameron (Ruck) and his best girl (Sara) to join him and, in the process, learn to enjoy what life has to offer.Naturally, there is a tyrannical school dean (Jones) who is determined to catch Ferris in the act of hookey and Ferris' own sister (Grey, pre-nose job) who has it in for her brother, the ""trouser-snake"".There are funny situations throughout the movie, and the characters are ones that grow on you, especially Ruck's worry-wart portrayal of Cameron Frye, constantly fretting about his dystalic, cursing his father and nearly drowning in a pool, all in the name of friendship.Sara has less to do, but she plays the object of desire well, and Ferris' passion for her is understandable. At least he thinks about the right things, like what their lives would be like after high school.All the way from beginning to end, this movie is a great trip in search of fun, relaxation, not taking life too seriously and how to sing Wayne Newton songs in the middle of a parade.You want to catch vintage John Hughes and classic '80s teendom at its best? Seize this ""Day""!Ten stars for ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off""."
Crocodile Dundee,1986,6.6,"An American reporter travels to the Australian outback to meet eccentric poacher Mick ""Crocodile"" Dundee and invites him to New York City, where he comes face-to-face with the complexities of modern life.","Linda Kozlowski plays a reporter who goes to the Australian Outback to do a story on Mick ""Crocodile"" Dundee, Played by Paul Hogan. She gets a good taste of Dundee's simple Tarzan-like life in the wilderness and decides to invite him to New York City. Dundee is a fish-out-of-water in the big city, of course, but it doesn't take him long to adapt, and the New Yorkers love him. Linda and Dundee naturally start to fall in love despite the fact that she has an arrogant fianc√©.""Crocodile Dundee"" was released in 1986 and spawned two sequels in 1988 and 2001. It successfully combines 3 genres or themes -- romantic comedy, adventure and fish-out-of-water.What makes the film work so well is the simple charisma of Paul Hogan. You'll likely never experience a more likable protagonist. On top of this, Linda Kozlowski is both likable and lovely, possessing an attractive spirituality and intelligence.Paul and Linda have great chemistry. The chemistry is real seeing as how they would marry four years later in 1990. This is funny in light of the fact that one of Roger Ebert's main criticisms of the film was their supposed lack of chemistry. I love Roger Ebert. He's a great writer and critic, but he obviously missed it big on this one!""Crocodile Dundee"" was the most successful Australian film ever. It only runs about 90 minutes before the credits start. This is great because romantic comedies like ""Dundee"" are light fare; there's simply no reason to go much longer than an hour and a half. In other words, ""Dundee"" doesn't overstay its welcome.GRADE: A-"
Tigerland,2000,6.9,"A group of recruits go through Advanced Infantry Training at Fort Polk, Louisiana's infamous Tigerland, last stop before Vietnam for tens of thousands of young men in 1971.","It is certainly interesting to write a review about a film that took place where I actually resided for two months. In September of 1971 when this film is set, your's truly was doing his basic training at Fort Polk, Louisiana. I did get to the North Fort at one point in my training where the infamous Tigerland was located. In fact Tigerland was a nickname given to the whole northern part of the army base.I was doing the basic training to be a weekend warrior and avoid Vietnam. But I saw so many of the kids who were just like the ones portrayed in the film it was actually a rather nerve wrecking old home week. In 1971 everyone except the policy makers in Washington knew that this was going to end when as Senator George Aiken declared, we said we won and then went home. And of course the South Vietnamese government we were protecting would fold like a napkin.By that time the army was scraping the bottom for soldier material and you can see it in the company of men that are in Tigerland. This is where more soldiers shipped for Vietnam than any other place in the nation. The Louisiana swamps best approximated the climate conditions of Vietnam.This particular company has a real odd ball in it with Colin Farrell. He's doing his best to get out of the army, but the army just won't oblige him. So he's waging his own war against them by becoming a 'barracks lawyer' and getting others out. And he's driving the officers and NCOs quite nuts doing it.I would rate Tigerland a lot higher because there is much I liked about the film. It was not shot at Fort Polk, but in places that gave you feel of the place. What I remember best about it was rain and mud. In that summer of 1971 it rained nearly every single day I was there. But the rain and sometimes it would come a few times a day. Would be a sudden downpour, maybe at most 20 minutes then it would cool off and then resume being muggy. And the ground couldn't absorb it fast enough so it was always muddy. You did your best work in that brief period after rain stopped it was then actually decent enough for normal activities.What I couldn't quite grasp was Colin Farrell's motivations for what he was doing. I blame that on the writer and also the director.As for the other players the best in the cast was Thomas Guiry playing this poor sad sack kid from the Louisiana bayous. I met a few just like him, he stopped his formal education at the 6th grade. It was a touching performance on Guiry's part.So here's to Fort Polk, not a place I recommend, but sometimes a place which is needed to train our soldiers. It got a good film, but not a great one in its honor."
EuroTrip,2004,6.6,"Dumped by his girlfriend, a high school grad decides to embark on an overseas adventure in Europe with his friends.","Reviewers say 'EuroTrip' is a teen comedy with crude humor and stereotypes, offering both laughs and criticism. Its over-the-top scenarios and celebrity cameos are praised, yet it faces backlash for cultural insensitivity and shallow depth. Comparisons to 'American Pie' yield mixed results. The film‚Äôs pacing and script receive varied feedback, balancing fun with simplicity against accusations of lacking sophistication."
Mr. Popper's Penguins,2011,6.0,"The life of a businessman begins to change after he inherits six penguins, and as he transforms his apartment into a winter wonderland, his professional side starts to unravel.","By now, Jim Carrey's career is one lined with a long history of hit and misses‚Äîfrom the zaney and energetic debut of Ace Ventura, to the less than stellar murmur of say, Bruce Almighty, Carrey is one of those comedic actors who occasionally takes his brand of comedy to breaking point, but somehow manages to stick around and continue raking in the dough. Flash forward now to the summer of 2011 where the comedic landscape in terms of family features in the cinema all seem to heading in the same direction‚Äîtalking animals‚Äîand you have a no brainer; hey, let's put those cute little fellas from Happy Feet in with that guy who made us a lot of money by pulling dumb faces! Sure; sounds like it could have potential, but in order to reach that potential one would have to, you know, write a script and not just mash them together with a generic by-the-numbers Big Business Man Learns To Be A Good Dad plot. Instead however what we're left with is an insulting homage to all things kitsch and puerile that repeats the same jokes over and over ad nauseam to the point of sheer boredom.The plot is simple: Mr. Popper is a wealthy business man who has all the riches in the world, but lacks the one currency that sells movies; love. Struggling to father his children in the same way that his father provided little support for him, Mr. Popper ends up inheriting a box of penguins from his recently deceased dad as a means of (somehow) connecting and finding the love that he lost through his short-sighting endeavours. What follows of course is exactly what you might expect from that brief synopsis, and maybe a quick look at a minute of the trailer. At first driving Popper up the wall, the penguins who each have their own delightful trait (we have Captain, Loudy, Bitey, Stinky, Lovey and Nimrod) soon warm up to their cold-hearted owner and vice versa as everyone involved learns that big fancy houses and a six figure income only matter as long as you're having fun and loving everything and wearing sweaters and giving high fives and being as routinely sickly as humanely possible without starring in an advertisement for the Nintendo Wii. Oh, and there are poop and fart jokes; and penguins running into things; plenty of them.As much of a stinker that the script is however, there was a time when one could rely on Jim Carrey and his assorted hijinks to bounce off stage and interrupt everyone's heavy eyelid batting and make us laugh, but even Carrey who is clearly showing his age here in this glossy advertisement for The American Dream fails to make much of an impression. There are a couple of moments here and there where Mr. Popper can be amusing, but for the most part he's like a bland, dislikeable caricature of Donald Trump. I mean, this is the same guy who made a lawyer the funniest person the screen during the summer of 1997‚Äî surely a salesman shouldn't be a problem? But it is; a real big one. And as it comes to its long overdrawn erratic conclusion, you get the impression that Carrey's comedic career is one destined to drown in a sea of similar safe-play Eddie Murphy-esque family comedies that leave adults snoring and kids running up and down the aisles. As Pippi Peponopolis might say; it's positively petulant, pandering and painful, Mr. Popper! So please, please stop pretending like love is the answer when clearly money is all that was on the minds of everyone involved here‚Äîthat's you're problem and how you fix it‚Äîobviously‚Äîis to give everyone at 20th Century Fox a penguin. Yabsolutely!"
Cloud Atlas,2012,7.4,"As souls are born and reborn, they renew their connections to one another throughout the ages.","Cloud Atlas is unlike its contemporaries at the multiplex. It tells a big story in an engaging, difficult fashion. It has big names and a big budget. But it also is thematically dense¬Ö it wants to tell you something through plot, characters, dialogue and symbols. Cloud Atlas is also thankfully a very enjoyable film, much longer and denser than much of what is available today. ""Ambition"" defines this film.In just under 3 hours, six radically different stories are told, and they appeal to a broad audience: a 19th century tale of unlikely brotherhood, the letters of a gay composer to his partner in the 1930's, a San Francisco- set conspiracy in the 70's, A hilarious account of an old publisher's woes. A Blade Runner-esque clone's struggle for freedom, and the survival of a tribe after 'The Fall'. Genre conventions are toppled, as these stories with different tones are juggled in short intervals, leading from comedic highs to shocking drama in minutes.But as with the characters, these plots are connected thematically, and clever wordplay and visual imagery links the stories, such as the end of a monologue referencing ""the gates of Hell"" and cutting to a shot of the gates of a building that, for Cavendish at least, is the gates of Hell. Each of the stories has strengths, a few have faults, but together the medley is incredible.I found that while the earliest two stories began slowly and plainly, they developed very well and provided fantastic drama, especially the 1849 story. The Nuclear thriller was strong, Halle Berry is great and there are some real twists, and I also loved the 'Dirty Harry' and 'China Syndrome' vibes, but comedy bled into it from the 2012 story which diminished the climax. The 2012 story is hilarious, and its first scene is a standout; Tom Hanks is incredible as Dermot Hoggins. Although while the story is interesting, it doesn't fit quite so well thematically- it's almost too light. Listening to the 'Cloud Atlas Sextet' fits with all the stories, but can't resonate with Cavendish's. The future Korea is visually stunning and communicates its themes well, certainly the darkest plot, but the action can get over the top (Yes, I know who directed this) and there are some horrible clich√©s. But that scene of horrendous dialogue, the weakest in the film, can't derail a great piece. Lastly is the bleak, Hawaii- set post-apocalyptic story. It was my favourite, possibly because I'm a sucker for anything involving apocalypse. But Hanks and Berry are fantastic again, the barbarians are menacing and scary, and the story is cool. It also concludes the film perfectly.I've only talked about the plot! The actors really steal the show. In the credits, each actor's name is placed with a clip of every one of their characters¬Ö everyone in the theatre stopped and stayed. People play characters you had no idea they played. A few highlights: Sturgess' lawyer and the slave Autua, Frobisher, Hugh Grant's sexist nuclear boss, Cavendish and Hanks' Hoggins. Doona Bae as Somni and Hugo Weaving's ""Old Georgie"" round it out- the latter is truly a demon. Much credit has to go to the makeup, literally making actors disappear into their roles. There is a huge number of transsexual and even race-bridging roles- it's worthy of note that Lana Wachowski was at one point Larry Wachowski. Also deserving of praise, and possibly Oscars is the large scale visual effects that cover hundreds of years and look so believable. Sound quality is top-notch as well, listening to Old Georgie is chilling, as is the vision of Korean diners, and well... the whole future.But all this plot serves a purpose, and Cloud Atlas intends to tell you things. Freedom is possibly the biggest theme, as well as the idea that our actions affect others greatly throughout time: we're part of a large human network. Really though there's so much to talk about you should just see the film. There are small stumbles every so often, but the structure hides them very well. No one story takes more time than others, no one character takes more time than others, and the structure and pacing drives the film forward briskly. It's a shame this film hasn't been better received commercially, because it's a phenomenal achievement, interesting sci-fi and drama, and as of now, the best film I've seen in 2012. 8.8/10"
Grown Ups,2010,6.0,"After their high school basketball coach passes away, five good friends and former teammates reunite for a Fourth of July holiday weekend.","Hollywood has lost the art of being funny. Mainly because everything has been done beyond the subtle. Short attention spans, filth masquerading as entertainment and too much freedom without consequences has reduced what's seen as funny to banal dick jokes.You know what's worse? Reading the sanctimonious crap written here in this forum.
I hate that some contributors want to coerce our agreement to their opinions by suggesting we have no taste if we disagree.Well, there's plenty of rubbish being peddled as comedy but like I said, I've seen worse.The overriding feeling I got was that the cast was having fun. Seemed natural with lots of ad lib. So what? I had fun too. So what!"
The Experiment,2001,7.7,"For two weeks, 20 male participants are hired to play prisoners and guards in a prison. The ""prisoners"" have to follow seemingly mild rules, and the ""guards"" are told to retain order without using physical violence.","Taxi driver and freelance journalist Tarek Fahd spots an advert in a newspaper for volunteers to take part in a psychological experiment over two weeks. He arrives along with a group of others, to be divided up into prisoners and guards before being placed into a simulated prison and provided with rules, Tarek being prisoner number 77. Initially everyone is enjoying themselves but soon the guards tire of the prisoners taking the p*ss and decide it is time to clamp down on their behaviour. As they realize that they have no limit on their powers, the actions of the guards become increasingly brutal and uncaring.Based on the infamous experiments carried out at Stanford in the 1970's, this film had it all going for it in terms of being an effective thriller while also looking at the ways that human nature will gravitate towards the cruel once they are placed in positions of power. I decided to watch this film because it seemed interesting on this basis but also very topical considering the behaviour of the US soldiers in the Iraq prisons ¬ñ mostly poor 'white trash' types who were corrupted when they suddenly found themselves in a position they had never been in before ¬ñ control. Like them, the characters here gradually get more extreme ¬ñ just like they did in the real experiment as well. With this topicality it is no surprise that I was easily taken in by the film and was never really bored by it. Being a thriller in its own right, the film has to settle into the eventual action conclusion but even this works pretty well and doesn't detract from what has gone before in terms of interest.This is not to say it is perfect, because it could have been much better than it was. The constant cutting to Tarek's girlfriend now and in flashback only took away from the film and she could have still played her part at the end with much less time during the main body of the film. Also it became a little too far-fetched for the sake of drama ¬ñ a recent television drama in the UK did it differently by actually recreating the same experiment as opposed to this film which needed to go harder and faster in order to reach the eventual running and fighting stage! But it still works and, to be honest, it is well worth seeking out for the 'human nature' aspect alone ¬ñ it had a special resonance in Germany but it is hard not to be put in a thoughtful mood given recent events in Iraqi military prisons.The cast are roundly good and all slip one way or the other in a convincing manner. Beibtreu is good once he gets past the stage where he is making trouble for the sake of it ¬ñ this is necessary to speed the descent into cruelty but it was laid on a bit thick at the start. After this his performance is much more evenly balanced and he is a good lead. I struggled to pick up the names of all the others because they were mostly unknown to me but the head guard was very good while the rest of the cast did more than just deliver their pigeon-holed characters, where really they could have been nothing more than 'prisoner who goes crazy', 'timid guard', 'angry guard', 'silent prisoner' etc ¬ñ they weren't, they were all pretty real people.Overall this is not the best thing to come to if you are after a sort of documentary drama about the original experiment but it is still a very good film. It is exciting and dramatic while still having a bit of a brain on it ¬ñ an asset made more interesting by what we have seen in Iraq over the past few months with guards becoming even worse than those we see in this film! Not a perfect film but a well made one that is interesting, involving and exciting and one that is well worth looking up."
The Rocky Horror Picture Show,1975,7.4,A newly-engaged couple have a breakdown in an isolated area and must seek shelter at the bizarre residence of Dr. Frank-n-Furter.,"Reviewers say 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' is celebrated for its unique blend of horror, comedy, and musical elements, creating a cult classic. Key themes include sexual liberation, rebellion, and individuality. Tim Curry's Dr. Frank-N-Furter is iconic, and the film's campy humor and memorable songs contribute to its popularity. Audience participation enhances the experience, solidifying its midnight movie status. Despite criticisms of plot coherence and production quality, energetic performances and subversive spirit make it influential pop culture."
Gattaca,1997,7.7,"Vincent, an ""In-Valid,"" assumes the identity of a member of the genetic elite to pursue his goal of traveling into space with the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation. However, a week before his mission, a murder marks Vincent as a suspect.","Gattaca is in many ways the best film I have seen about prejudice. Just as people have been judged for centuries by the color of their skin, Gattaca predicts that in the future there will be a more subtle discrimination. It being a science fiction film helps make it more effective by allowing us to feel the emotions of the characters with little of our own history getting in the way. A haunting musical score goes well with the feeling of the film.Ethan Hawke as Vincent does a fine job showing the pain of someone whose life is limited before he even tries. But just as interesting were the supposedly superior characters; Vincent's girlfriend, brother and double who suffer from the lie that genetics can perfectly predict a person's life.The film that Gattaca most reminds me of is Blade Runner. They are both about genetic engineering gone very wrong but Gattaca takes a very different approach. The problems are more subtle in Gattaca involving our own desires for success for ourselves and through our children. Amazingly, Gattaca is a good science fiction film with a small budget, few special effects and mostly filmed in existing modern buildings.After seeing this film for a second time I liked it even better as the plot seemed more plausible. If you would like to see a sci-fi film that is based on interesting characters and situations and not explosions or special effects, try Gattaca."
The Neverending Story,1984,7.3,A troubled boy dives into a wondrous fantasy world through the pages of a mysterious book.,"I think most people that have seen this will agree that this is one of the best fantasy films ever made!  I think I may have to agree with them!This film has a special place in my heart, cause I grew up with this film. I've probably seen this film more times than any other movie (although, it may be too close to call with ""Labyrinth"", ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""The Dark Crystal"" in the running)!  Isn't it funny how when you were young you could watch the same movie over and over and over and over and never get sick of it...not that a whole lot has changed since then, but it cracks me up how well I remember this film ever time I see it.  I remember just about ever line, every scene, every nuance, every single little miniscule detail about this movie!  Ok...I'm sounding a bit obsessed aren't I.Well, what I'm trying to say here is that this is a great film and with an excellent story.  The acting, directing, special effects, and everything else is just excellent in this film!  Wolfgang Petersen really out-did himself with this film!  I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that likes fantasy films...what am I saying, I would (and do) recommend this film to EVERYONE!  What are you reading this review for?  Go see this movie!!!  Thanks for reading,-Chris"
True Lies,1994,7.3,"A fearless, globe-trotting, terrorist-battling secret agent has his life turned upside down when he discovers his wife might be having an affair with a used-car salesman while terrorists smuggle nuclear war heads into the United States.","I've seen this movie countless amount of times as with all the other arnie movies, but this is my favourite for sure.  Whilst it doesnt rate as high in action compared to the other Arnie movies.   This is definately arnies best comedy and with the above average action, it makes this movie Arnies best overall movie.  Heaps of good explosions, shooting and hand to hand combat and hilarious comedy from all cast members.  Art Malik and his men were hilarious especially when they were trying to be serious.  Tom Arnold is perfect for his role, hilarious without even trying.  But the funniest of all would have to be Bill Paxton especially while he is in the car with Arnie describing Jamie Lee Curtis to him and role playing a secret agent. Truely belly aching laughter!  Tia Carrera and Jamie Lee Curtis were absolutely gorgeous.  Who could ever forget that striptease by Jamie Lee Curtis? A 10/10 for me.  I havent felt so good after watching a movie for a long time."
Hot Shots!,1991,6.7,A parody of Top Gun (1986) in which a talented but unstable fighter pilot must overcome the ghosts of his father and save a mission sabotaged by greedy weapons manufacturers.,"I should have rewatched Top Gun before seeing this ... I did hold back on that to make it a ""double feature"" when the second Top Gun movie finally gets its theatrical release .. you know when Cinemas reopen and all that. You can still see that it spoofs that Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer (gay?) bromance . Now don't get overexcited or offended - the undertones are there and they get spoofed here. If you are easily offended maybe do not watch this movie. Though you'd be missing out on many good jokes - from one third of the Zaz team ... he knows his stuff for sure! And the cast is amazing too.Bridges is on a roll here, as is Sheen and the others. The erotic scene of the movie is exactly that by the way ... hot and steamy, but also super funny. I sort of miss those cool spoof movies ... you could tell they loved movies and didn't just make fun of anything they saw ... there was much love ... and ridiculous insanity included."
Cast Away,2000,7.8,A FedEx executive undergoes a physical and emotional transformation after crash landing on a deserted island.,"I think this is an excellent movie..I've noticed many felt it ""too long, boring, etc..."" which is to be expected in today's ""gimme non-stop action; I haven't been doing anything for 5 minutes, I'm bored"" mentality.  This was a true man vs nature movie that really made me think about what I take for granted and I found myself wondering how I would react in such a situation. Would I talk to a volleyball?  you betcha...anyone who has spent any significant time alone can relate.  Bought the DVD and will watch it for years too come."
Sherlock Holmes,2009,7.5,Detective Sherlock Holmes and his stalwart partner Watson engage in a battle of wits and brawn with a nemesis whose plot is a threat to all of England.,"... not the movie, but the number of self-professed Holmes aficionados who apparently have no knowledge of Holmes. For the record, Holmes was a miserable, irresponsible drug addict who did indeed sleep on the floor, insult his best friend, experiment on his dog, and never ever wore a deerstalker's cap (at least, not until television was invented). He was a brawler who practiced martial arts and was as likely to slum around in the filthiest of rags as he was a suit.It wasn't until after Doctor Watson took him in hand that he truly refined himself and became a ""respectable"" member of society. And yes, we can tell that this movie takes place THAT early in their relationship because Watson has not yet married his wife (the retconning did annoy me, too, by the way, but you just can't avoid a little re-imagining here and there).Speaking of unavoidable, Irene Adler, Holmes' one uncapturable (is that a word?), simply had to be cast as a potential love interest. The flirting, the romance, and the near-make-out session were irresistible to the director (and to all of the audience who're honest with themselves).That being said, I felt Robert Downey, Jr. played Sherlock Holmes to perfection. His characteristic caustic attitude towards Lestrade and even Watson at times was exactly how I'd imagine him. He gives several summations of his observations and deductions that brought Holmes to life in an almost unparalleled way. His fight scenes (preceded the first few times by superhuman calculations) show both the mental and physical sides of Holmes in ways that Watson's notes can't quite convey, but at which they constantly hint.As for Watson himself, Jude Law delivered a wonderful performance. I was a little skeptical of how well he fought, given Watson's wartime injury, but his character and demeanor were entirely on the nose. His loyalty to Holmes despite his frustrations with him could not have been captured more expertly, I feel. No one, no matter how patient or forgiving, could endure Holmes forever without the occasional confrontation. The original Holmes, after all, was not above insulting his best friend or even deriding his deductive capabilities at times. Nevertheless, Watson never could abandon his friend in his time of need.This version (or vision, if you will) of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's greatest creation may be more swashbuckling, more thrilling, and more edgy than any other incarnation, but that doesn't make it any less faithful to the original. Aside from a little revisionist history in the cases of the female leads, nothing is that far out of the ordinary; and no amount of references to Madonna will change that."
The Old Man and the Sea,1958,6.9,An old Cuban fisherman's dry spell is broken after he hooks a gigantic fish that drags him out to sea.,"Ernest Hemingway's ""The Old Man and the Sea"" is a classic literary work but it isn't well suited to screen adaptation. This film has some of the necessary ingredients for success but comes up short in several respects.Spencer Tracy turns in a fine performance as the titular 'old man', one which was rewarded with an Oscar nomination. Felipe Pazos (as the boy), on the other hand, is a dreadful actor and almost drags Tracy's performance down in the scenes that they share. Tracy does double duty as the omniscient narrator as well, though I don't think that it made much sense to delegate that task to the actor playing the main character of the film.John Sturges seems to have had to cobble together footage from various shoots and locations, resulting in a somewhat haphazard look. Budgetary concerns were likely a part of the problem along with limitations in technology.Dimitri Tiomkin's score won an Oscar but I didn't think it was that exceptional. Certainly not nearly as memorable as the scores that Elmer Bernstein provided for Sturges's ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""The Great Escape"".While some will undoubtedly find the story boring I think that it is easily the best part of this picture. Behind the simple story of a man and his marlin there are layers upon layers of deeper meaning. I could have done without some of the narration, though, particularly when the same thing could have been conveyed with visuals.In the end, I give the content of the film high points though the film's technical aspects are riddled with inadequacies. It's worth watching but you should be prepared for some decidedly rough edges."
The Queen,2006,7.3,"After the death of Princess Diana, Queen Elizabeth II struggles with her reaction to a sequence of events nobody could have predicted.","It's 1997. Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) and the Labour Party have just won a landslide victory. Then Princess Diane is killed in a Paris tunnel. The Queen (Helen Mirren) is reluctant to change any protocol. Prince Philip (James Cromwell) dismisses the tidal wave of grief. Blair tries to advise them despite their intransigence. Eventually the pressure becomes too overwhelming and the Royals must change with the times.There are two great performances in this. There is also an interesting personal drama within this international story. The death of a princess may not be important in the grand scheme of it all, but it provides a backdrop for a compelling personal drama. Michael Sheen seems to be the guy to play Tony Blair. He's great at it. Helen Mirren is exceptional. She brings both the stoic and the scared with such ease. She fully deserves the Oscar for best actress."
DragonHeart,1996,6.4,"The last dragon and a disillusioned dragon-slaying knight must unite to stop an evil king, who was granted partial immortality.","Warrior Dennis Quaid and the last dragon on Earth (voiced by the excellent Sean Connery) try to take down evil Middle-Age ruler David Thewlis in this fun and impressive action flick. Dina Meyer, Pete Postlethwaite and Julie Christie all do good jobs in supporting turns. The greatest thing about ""Dragonheart"" however is its amazing score which is arguably the finest a film has ever experienced. The production's music raises what could have been a mediocre outing for all involved. 4 stars out of 5."
Ghost Town,2008,6.7,"Bertram Pincus is a man whose people skills leave much to be desired. When Pincus dies unexpectedly, but is miraculously revived after seven minutes, he wakes up to discover that he now has the annoying ability to see ghosts.","I can't understand how I missed it. Written and directed by David Koepp, the man who wrote ""Apartment Zero"" and ""Death Becomes Her"" with Martin Donovan, a personal hero of mine. Not to mention some of the biggest moneymakers of the last two decades. ""Ghost Town"" strives for something else, it pinpoints the goodness hidden in the heart of someone who, perhaps, never knew was there. A comedy of personal discovery no less. I was moved and delighted. Ricky Gervais goes through it, stumbling over himself with an innocence that is as real as it is mysterious. I connected with him half way through and it took me by surprise. I was loving a character that at the beginning I thought was funny but despicable. That for me means I've learned something. Thank you."
Groundhog Day,1993,8.0,"A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day.","Reviewers say 'Groundhog Day' is celebrated for its unique plot and Bill Murray's exceptional performance, blending comedy with existential themes. The film explores self-discovery and the value of each day, with Andie MacDowell adding emotional depth. Critics appreciate its message about cherishing life, though some find the repetitive plot boring. The direction, screenplay, and supporting cast receive mixed reviews, with some deeming them lacking. Despite criticisms, 'Groundhog Day' is often regarded as a classic with enduring appeal."
Four Weddings and a Funeral,1994,7.1,"Over the course of five social occasions, a committed bachelor must consider the notion that he may have discovered love.","Richard Curtis's films have sometimes been criticised for giving a too cosy, conservative view of British society. ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" seems to take place in an England of eternal summer, a land which consists almost entirely of green and pleasant countryside and the more exclusive districts of London and which is populated solely by members of the upper and upper-middle classes. The script does cross the border into an equally idealised Scotland of mists, tartans and Highland flings, but even these scenes were actually shot in Surrey. Such criticism contains an element of truth, but is largely irrelevant when it comes to assessing the merits of the film because it ignores the fact that most romantic comedies (in other media as well as in the cinema) are set against a relatively narrow background in terms of social class, often enabling the writer to satirise the manners of that class. Jane Austin, for example, the most successful writer of romantic comedy in nineteenth-century England, set all her works among the wealthy landed gentry or prosperous bourgeoisie of the day.Most of the action of the film takes place either at, or immediately before or after, one of the four church services mentioned in the title. The main character, Charles, is a well-to-do young man, probably educated at public school, and clearly a member of the professional classes, although we never actually discover what his job is. The film starts with a wedding at which Charles is best man to Angus, one of his old friends, and at which he meets Carrie, an attractive young American woman. The film then traces the ups and downs of the relationship of Charles and Carrie, via two more weddings (the second of which is Carrie's own, after she and Charles have split up), the funeral of Gareth, another friend of Charles who suffers a heart attack while dancing at Carrie's wedding, and one final marriage ceremony.Hugh Grant, as Charles, gives a very good performance. Grant has a relatively narrow range as an actor, but he is capable of some excellent work within that range. There are some subtle differences between Charles and William, the character Grant played in ""Notting Hill"", another romantic comedy written by Curtis. William is a shy young man who uses ironic, self-deprecating humour as a cover for his shyness and lack of self-confidence. He is very much in love with Anna, that film's heroine, but is afraid to declare his love because he cannot believe that a beautiful and successful film star would take any interest in the owner of a small bookshop. Charles, by contrast, is less shy than William and enjoys more success with women. His humour is also ironic, but for a different reason. He is afraid of his emotions and of commitment and uses irony as a means of distancing himself from life and of avoiding having to commit himself.The film can be seen as the story of Charles's journey to emotional maturity. He has had a number of brief affairs, all of which have petered out precisely because he is afraid of his emotions. His relationship with Carrie initially goes the same way and she marries a richer and older man. The change in Charles's character is partly due to the fact that he sees his carefree bachelor world disappearing as most of his friends get married, but the event which seems to have the greatest effect on him is Gareth's funeral, at which a moving eulogy is read by Matthew, Gareth's gay partner, touchingly played by John Hannah. Charles realises the strength of the love that Gareth and Matthew shared for one another and comes to appreciate that such a relationship is something to be valued.Grant does well to make Charles a sympathetic figure, despite his having many failings quite apart from his ironic distancing of himself from the world. He is clumsy, accident-prone (he manages to lose the ring at Angus's wedding), much given to profane language and can be appallingly tactless, especially about his former girlfriends. The other main character, Carrie, can perhaps be seen as a female Charles, someone who is on the same journey as him but who has travelled slightly further. (It is significant that her name is short for Caroline, the feminine equivalent of the name Charles). She freely admits to having had over thirty previous lovers, but she is the first to want to bring emotional commitment to their relationship. Am I, incidentally, the only one to have liked Andie MacDowell's performance?- she has come in for a lot of criticism, in my view undeserved, on this board.The film is, however, more than simply a study of relationships- it is also very funny with some superb lines. Hugh Grant can be very amusing, and there was a great cameo from Rowan Atkinson as a bumbling, nervous trainee priest who keeps fluffing his lines during one of the weddings. (""Awful wedded wife"", or ""Holy Goat"" for ""Holy Ghost""). I also liked David Bower as Charles's deaf brother David, the late Charlotte Coleman as his impudent younger sister Scarlett and Anna Chancellor as his ex-girlfriend Henrietta (also known as Duckface), whose embarrassing emotional incontinence perhaps explains why Charles is so keen to distance himself from his feelings. I was less impressed by Simon Callow as Gareth, loud, extrovert and excessively hearty (like most characters Callow plays).To sum up, this was a very good film indeed; proof that the British cinema can produce romantic comedies as good as Hollywood at its best. 8/10"
Captain America: The First Avenger,2011,6.9,"Steve Rogers, a rejected military soldier, transforms into Captain America after taking a dose of a ""Super-Soldier serum"". But being Captain America comes at a price as he attempts to take down a warmonger and a terrorist organization.","Reviewers say 'Captain America: The First Avenger' is lauded for its engaging origin story, Chris Evans' strong performance, and nostalgic WWII setting. The film impresses with its action sequences, visual effects, and introduction of key characters. However, some find Red Skull underdeveloped and the pacing uneven. Its blend of historical drama and superhero elements is noted, though some wish for more innovation. Overall, it is seen as a solid MCU addition."
Eldor√°d√≥,1988,7.6,Sandor Monori thinks that he can buy everything with his gold. The story takes place after the World War II at the famous Teleki ter where he is the King of the market.,"The one of the best Hungarian movies, and the one of the bests on the world. A deep drama about life in Hungary after the WW2 until the revolt against Russians in '56. The main character is the head of the black market in Budapest. He thinks he can buy everyone and everything but at the end he must face that he can't buy life. A must-see for everyone.Casting involves some of the greatest Hungarian actors. The story takes place in the eighth district of Budapest focusing on the market place on Teleki square which is still working. The movie contains some archive footage of real fight during the revolution."
Captain Corelli's Mandolin,2001,5.9,"When a fisherman leaves to fight with the Greek army during World War II, his fianc√©e falls in love with the local Italian commander.","Ok, it's a given that you cannot make a good movie from a good book. (Unless you make it a trilogy :-) But comparing the book Corelli's Mandolin to this movie it's clear how much has to be cut to fit a screenplay. The book is very funny in places, romantic (of course), dramatic. What's left of it in the film is inexplicable romance -- as other reviewers have remarked, it's unclear why she falls in love with the italian while her betrothed is still around, and I have no idea why this was changed from the book -- and some gratuitous gunning and bombing scenes, more than in the book which derives its power from not hammering on the obvious points. Whole characters are cut: Carlo has maybe 10 seconds screen time, while in the book he has a whole story line that runs several chapters."
What's Eating Gilbert Grape?,1993,7.7,A young man in a small Midwestern town struggles to care for his mentally-disabled younger brother and morbidly obese mother while attempting to pursue his own happiness.,"This film starts out slow, but after we get to know the characters and their (dis)abilities, we begin to place ourselves in their shoes and the action picks up. Perhaps Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance ever, this movie is a true drama.The focus of the movie is of course Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp). However, there are really several focal points in the movie, all of which add to a powerful storyline. As the title of the film suggests, just about everything seems to be a hardship for Gilbert, yet, somehow he manages to come to terms with reality and in the end obtains a newfound respect for life.With good performances by supporting actors and actresses (Juliette Lewis, Darlene Cates, Leo D., and all the other ""Grapes"") and a nice comic relief from the city coroner (Bobby McBurney) and the local handyman (John C. Reilly), this movie should be seen by anyone who wishes to put themselves in a place where country roads and beautiful greenery give way to the perils and pitfalls of smalltown life.Overall great acting, a good story, and something with which we can all relate. ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" is an excellent movie!"
Los amantes pasajeros,2013,5.6,"When it appears as though the end is in sight, the pilots, flight crew, and passengers of a plane heading to Mexico City look to forget the anguish of the moment and face the greatest danger, which we carry within ourselves.","This film is about the pilots, business class crew and business class passengers on a fateful flight to Mexico City.""Los Amantes Pasajeros"" tells a really funny story about eleven clich√©d characters on a transatlantic flight. There is much alcohol, drugs, camp characters and of course lots of sex (both gay and straight). The plot is so hilarious that no one can take it seriously! Every business class passenger has a story, and a distinct personality. When they are trapped in the flight, literally hell breaks loose. I really like the three flight attendants, they are just so funny! When the plane was going to land, I could not believe it was already 90 minutes into the film - I thought it was just 30 minutes in! The journey was so hilarious that time just flew by at sonic speed.""Los Amantes Pasajeros"" is very unlike other Pedro Almod√≥var films, in fact I don't even remember him making such a camp and fluffy comedy before! I really loved every minute of it."
Picassos √§ventyr,1978,7.3,"A farcical biopic about Pablo Picasso, from his early years, to his middle years, to the years right before his death, and some of the years before and in-between that.","Hasse Alfredsson's and Tage Danielsson's films has always had a special place in my heart, and in particular ""The Adventures of Picasso"". The film is about Picasso's life and art, told through a distorted mirror.For those not familiar with Hasse & Tage's style, it might seem to be a somewhat shallow and burlesque film, but it is more than a ordinary comedy. It also shows the trouble of becoming the victim of your own public image, and how the creativity and the personal life may suffer from it. In many ways it is a film in the same spirit as Charlie Chaplin's ""The Dictator"", slapstick mixed with reflection.Pablo Picasso once said that ""We all know that art is not the truth, art is a lie that makes us realize the truth"" and I think that ""The Adventures of Picasso"" encompass this in a very nice way!"
The Sea Inside,2004,8.0,"The factual story of Spaniard Ramon Sampedro, who fought a 28-year campaign in favor of euthanasia and his own right to die.","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Alejandro Amenabar creates life against all odds in this based on a true story version of one man's struggle to control his destiny. The great Javier Bardem is fascinating to watch in his role as Ramon. His eyes and head movements leave little doubt what is going on in his mind. The dream and fantasy sequences are not overused so prove very effective in explaining why he wants what he wants. Rather than force us to answer the euthanasia question, the real question posed is , What is Love? At every turn we see people in love, looking for love or dying to be loved. The script is tight and keeps the film moving despite being filmed mostly in one room. The supporting cast is wonderful and we truly feel their pain and how each family member deals with Ramon's decision. This is a gem and deserves to be seen."
Invictus,2009,7.3,"Nelson Mandela, in his first term as President of South Africa, initiates a unique venture to unite the Apartheid-torn land: enlist the national rugby team on a mission to win the 1995 Rugby World Cup.","To my mind, this is less about South Africa, sport and Mandela than about another man.Oh, the drama was really there. It doesn't matter that it was not as significant in uniting a nation as depicted. How could it be? How could it?But the dramatic form is there because it works. We like to show the sweep of the large by embossing on an individual. Here at least we don't have love. And we like to illustrate a personal struggle by showing masses in huge movement. Masses and mass excitement are cinematic, and human internals cannot be. So we show internal struggle by external means.What I celebrate is another man, Clint Eastwood. Now here is a man well past the time he could relax, making significant films. This is not complex like ""Mystic River,"" nor as cheaply mawkish as ""Million Dollar Baby."" It is in between. But it is ‚Äî if I recall ‚Äî the first time Clint has shown mass movement. Here he uses Morgan Freeman in ways that Morgan has a hard time cheapening the thing.Photographing moving team sports like football, soccer and basketball is something of a challenge. You have to make decisions about what role the camera plays. Dance is a similar challenge, but you have more flexibility because the tradition in theater is to break the walls and engage. In sport, the barrier between player and watcher is sacrosanct. The drama depends on you investing in the game; the fiction that the players represent you is tangible.But it equally depends on you being remote, whether in a stadium or in an upholstered chair in your home. That distance makes the business work. It allows representation without inclusion, because the viewer gets the pleasure of having someone else do his work for him. It has to be explicit that it is someone else.So the camera cannot take the viewer into the game as a participant. It has to always be a watcher. But how to do so, staying within the carefully evolved confines of watcherdom and still give us some greater immediacy? Eastwood finds a balance. He relies a bit too much on the camera on the ground, looking into the locked players for me. But he strikes a better balance than say Oliver Stone does in ""Any Given Sunday,"" which is basically a war movie without death.Eastwood. Building a legacy, one small but well crafted film at a time. Who among us ever suspected that this fellow, with no film school, no real musical training, would become one of our most practiced directors and film musicians.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
Pineapple Express,2008,6.9,A process server and his marijuana dealer wind up on the run from hitmen and a corrupt police officer after he witnesses his dealer's boss murder a competitor while trying to serve papers on him.,I can just watch this movie over and over and crack up every time. The fight scenes are the best EVER. I can't say enough about how funny it is. Watch it with friends!
Biutiful,2010,7.4,A man dying of cancer tries his best to leave the world on his own terms.,"Biutiful is a departure and a confirmation for Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu: on the one hand, it is another study of lives gone awry, with no punches pulled in regards to the misery experienced by the characters; on the other, it's the first film he's made he parted ways with screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga, who preferred to move on to other projects after Babel. Biutiful proves two things: firstly, Inarritu remains very good at constructing memorable images; secondly, these aren't worth quite as much without Arriaga's words.Set in Barcelona, the film ditches the filmmaker's traditional fragmented, multi-character narrative, focusing solely on one imposing figure: Uxbal (Javier Bardem), a man who has to deal with his own imminent death from cancer, a dire relationship with his family (wife, kids and brother), his ties to local criminal activities and, more generally, the ugliness he sees every day walking down the streets. Surely the (intentionally misspelled) title must be ironic.Working on the script himself, Inarritu goes for a simpler story, but doesn't renounce his penchant for harrowing material. In fact, Biutiful is undoubtedly the least cheerful film he's directed to this day, and that's saying something. His depiction of a gray, ugly Barcelona is faultless, exposing the city's seedy underbelly and disease (both physical and spiritual) with genuine, relentless storytelling passion. However, this is also detrimental to the film's impact: without Arriaga's more experienced take on the subject, the director doesn't know when to stop, throwing in one tragedy after another for the best part of the movie's 148 minutes, with no pause for breathing. It's almost too bleak, too tragic, to fully convince as a drama.Does this mean all the praise Inarritu has received in the past was premature? Not really. Even his detractors usually acknowledge his talent with actors, and in this case, perhaps being aware of the script's shortcomings, he has hit the jackpot: from start to finish, Bardem is a revelation, justly awarded with the Best Actor prize in Cannes. Sure, he's always been a gifted thespian, and no stranger to difficult parts (see The Sea Inside), but here he's really in a class of his own. Communicating with his sad, tired eyes rather than his broken voice, he carries the whole picture with a stoic dignity that is always gripping and heartbreaking.While easy to mock and criticize, Biutiful, for all its flaws, warrants at least one viewing on the grounds that it proves beyond doubt that sometimes a truly astounding performance can save an otherwise mediocre film."
Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,1997,7.0,A world-class playboy and part-time secret agent from the 1960s emerges after thirty years in a cryogenic state to battle with his nemesis Dr. Evil.,"When he made Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery Mike Myers aspired to comic greatness, the kind we had not seen on the screen since Peter Sellers. Only Sellers and Alec Guinness could create so many believable characters in the same film and make them work the way Myers does with Austin Powers and his perennial nemesis Doctor Evil.Hard to believe, but back in the swinging London of the Sixties, the British kids really did dress like Austin Powers. The key to Powers character is that whether he's in the Sixties or the Nineties, he's still an overgrown kid.The film is like the old Batman TV series where the Gotham City Police Department is good enough at dealing with ordinary criminals. But when exotic types like the Joker or the Penguin threaten the law and order of Gotham City, Commissioner Gordon reaches for the Batphone and Adam West and Burt Ward start doing their thing in tights.Powers is on the verge of nabbing Doctor Evil back in the day when the doctor takes off in a rocketship and cryogenically freezes himself. It's also some rocketship if I do say so. Not to be outdone, British Intelligence cryogenically freezes Austin Powers because he's the only man capable of dealing with Evil in their service.Both men have to adapt to a culture shock. Doctor Evil has mixed feelings about the test tube baby son he fathered in Seth Green. As for Powers, he's not quite fathoming the fact that his Emma Peel like partner Mimi Rogers from back in the day has a daughter in Elizabeth Hurley doing her bit in the family spy business.Michael York as the M character and Powers boss and Robert Wagner as Number 2 in the Evil Empire both look like they're having a really good time hamming up their parts. There's also a nice unbilled part by Tom Arnold as a cowboy in the men's room with Powers when one of the Evil assassins tries to get him.A lot of good laughs in this first Austin Powers film, I do so hope Mike Myers does make still another one."
Kick-Ass,2010,7.6,"Dave Lizewski is an unnoticed high school student and comic book fan who one day decides to become a superhero, even though he has no powers, training or meaningful reason to do so.","Reviewers say 'Kick-Ass' is a bold, ambitious superhero film with a unique blend of action, comedy, and drama. Praised for its originality, strong performances, and stylish direction, it also faces criticism for its dark humor, graphic violence, and profanity. Hit-Girl's standout performance is frequently highlighted. Opinions on its success vary, with some appreciating its satirical take and others finding its tone inconsistent and reliant on shock value."
Charlie's Angels,2000,5.6,"Three private investigators are assigned to track down a kidnapped software engineer, but the case isn't as straightforward as it seems.","I went to see 'Charlie's Angels' out of interest after all the interesting coverage from the set.The laughably complex plot seems to flow along well with the movie. I found it particularly funny, and enjoyed all the fighting scenes and the fabulous soundtrack.The performances impressed me the most. Everyone looks like they're having fun, but my favourite was Natalie (Cameron Diaz). When she smiles, you can't help but smile along with her. I also admired that the girls also did all their own stunts, something not too common in films. And despite the rumours, Bill Murray and the girls had good chemistry and he proved an able sidekick to the girls.With that said, I'll say four words: Bring on the sequel!"
Rush Hour,1998,7.0,"A loyal and dedicated Hong Kong Inspector teams up with a reckless and loudmouthed L.A.P.D. detective to rescue the Chinese Consul's kidnapped daughter, while trying to arrest a dangerous crime lord along the way.","Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) is a wisecracking, plays by his own rules type policeman who gets a little bit carried away with his job.  When a drug bust goes haywire and two cops caught in the crossfire are shot, the LAPD Supervisor knows it's all Carter's fault!  Not looking very highly towards Carter, the LAPD Supervisor gives him two options: Either be suspended without his badge for two months, or help the FBI chase after a gang of ruthless criminals who have kidnapped a Chinese Diplomat's daughter (Julie Hsu). The choices for this egotistic, self-centered cop will not be simple...Enter Detective Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan), a police officer who wrote the book on fighting crime. Back in LA, Carter immediately gets his feet wet before shortly experiencing a chagrin moment. Detective Carter has learned that his assignment is to baby-sit Inspector Lee.    Carter must make sure that Lee does not interfere with the FBI's business.   Carter is not happy with the workload he is responsible for, but he must fulfill his duty nonetheless...Carter usually works alone...this time, he has company. Reluctantly, the Lee and Carter align together and a culture clash becomes obvious. The wonderful pair is drawn to a series of mishaps, conspiracies, and plenty of high kicking action and adventure! Carter shows Lee a tour or two around the city of Los Angeles; and the pair quickly become best buddies. However, Lee and Carter can't help but to interfere with the FBI's affairs. Lee cares only so much about the kidnapped child.  He feels that he must help track her down before the nefarious villains murder her... Meanwhile, Carter ticks off a few of the locals before he faces absolute terror. Can Lee convince Carter to focus on this mission to rescue the Diplomat's daughter held for ransom? Or will it be too late?RUSH HOUR is one of the most jamming action/comedy mixtures ever.  This film is one awesome venture with the presence of both Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker helping to create a winner for the action genre. RUSH HOUR is entertaining, a fast-paced cop-buddy flick. Part of this film's success owes to the eccentric chemistry between the two leading stars. For example, Jackie Chan's athletic capabilities are strikingly in contrast to Chris Tucker's overzealous, fidgety reactions. Chan's ability to maneuver high risk jumps, leaps, and other assorted dangerous stunts definitely keeps the energy going while Tucker's jittery silliness always creates a warm smile on the viewer's face. Tucker's motor-mouth is surprisingly compatible to Chan's martial arts prowess. Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are a definite revelation!The cast in RUSH HOUR prove themselves worthy of their roles. Besides the two main characters, the supporting cast is terrific. Elizabeth Pena adds a touch of sentimentality as Tucker's unappreciated sidekick who turns out to be an asset to the police department after all. Mark Rolston (ALIENS) and Tzi Ma (CHAIN REACTION, RAPID FIRE) as a strategic FBI agent and Consul Han respectively all add credibility to their parts. Newcomer Julie Hsu is also fabulous as a hostage who proves to be more difficult for the bad guys than they can handle...RUSH HOUR has top notch stunts mixed with one-of-a-kind comical moments which help make this film an enlightening combination of action and comedy, with a dash of Chan's fantastic skill work.The Chan-Tucker collaboration is the best on-screen duo since Abbott & Costello! The duo has showed all their right moves and have proven themselves a spectacular heroic pair for moviegoers to cheer on everywhere. Again, the action in RUSH HOUR is no short of exhilarating with outrageous sequences such as Chan trying to protect a valuable vase from the wrath of the bad guys.Great dance moves by Tucker, but nobody impresses the audience like Jackie Chan leaping from place to place, mowing down the bad guys! RUSH HOUR is fantastic fun! A must-see for die hard action enthusiasts. This film is Jackie Chan's and Chris Tucker's finest hour.  Watch for the requisite funny outtakes by the film's end credits.RATING: *** out of ****."
S.W.A.T.,2003,6.1,"An imprisoned drug kingpin offers a huge cash reward to anyone that can break him out of police custody, and only the L.A.P.D.'s Special Weapons and Tactics team can prevent it.","This movie is no doubt influenced by the 'Die Hard' series.  In this case, 1990's 'Die Hard 2' where the plot involved a drug dealer.  A drug dealer in this case offers 100 million dollars to anyone who can bust him out after he is captured.  Naturally, everyone with a greedy agenda, including some people that really make things sticky for the good guys, try to spring him. This film has a nice gradual build to its eventual payoff and Colin Farrell and Samuel L. Jackson are in good form.  I only wish that their characters had been a little better developed.  It's nice to see a movie where a character has a particular manner, saying or habit that makes their personality instantly recognizable.  This is one of the better films to be based on 70's television.  Certainly better than the 'Charlie's Angels' films (rubbish)."
Rush Hour 2,2001,6.7,"Carter and Lee head to Hong Kong for a vacation, but become embroiled in a counterfeit money scam.","`Rush Hour 2' is a highly enjoyable follow-up to the original 1998 box office smash.  Like the previous film, this first of what will undoubtedly be a long line of lucrative sequels combines sardonic humor with eye-popping martial arts action sequences to entertaining effect.  Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan repeat their roles as unlikely cop buddies, starting off the film in Chan's home territory, Hong Kong, and finishing up in Tucker's, the good ole US of A.Chan, with his sheepish deadpan delivery, makes a perfect straight man for Tucker's fast-talking bad brotha wiseacre, whose mouth engages in more heavy-duty action than Chan's karate-chopping hands and feet.  Much of the humor is generated by Tucker's ability to seem totally unflustered by any peril that happens to come his way, managing to sass talk his way out of one dangerous predicament after another.  Moreover, Chan's ability to create humor out of perfectly choreographed stunt sequences puts him right up there with some of the silent comedy greats like Chaplin and Keaton.  The split-second perfection of these scenes, combined with the balletic grace with which they are executed, makes him one of the truly unique talents working in movies today.   Luckily, in his move to mainstream American filmmaking, Chan has been able to find behind-the-scenes talent good enough to match his own.  The screenplay by Jeff Nathanson, though no world-beater when it comes to originality or depth, does posses a playful spirit that works well in the context of the genre.  Likewise, director Brett Ratner keeps the action percolating along at a lively, often dizzying clip.As with most Chan films, however, `Rush Hour 2' seems to go on for about a half hour too long ¬ñ even though its running time barely clocks in at a very short 90 minutes.  Perhaps this type of material really can't be sustained much beyond an hour before the repetitiousness of it begins to take its toll.  However, that is certainly a minor quibble about a film that, for the most part, provides plenty of laughs, some kick-ass performances and action sequences that, as per usual for a Chan film, will, quite literally, make your jaw drop.  ."
I Give It a Year,2013,5.7,"Newlywed couple Nat and Josh are deliriously happy despite their differences, though friends and family aren't convinced that they can last. With their first anniversary approaching and attractive alternatives in the mix, can they last?","The rom-comedy genre has been known for being very formulaic and often entries are a dime a dozen. It is hard to stand out of the crowd and it is often a genre that plays it safe. But I Give It a Year is a film that attempts to twist the rom-com clich√©s.Josh (Rafe Spall) and Nat (Rose Byrne) are a couple who after dating for seven months decide to get married, even though they friends and family think they are marrying too soon. And it turns out they are right with their marriage hits the rocks. Their eyes soon wonder to two American, Chloe (Anna Farris), Josh's ex-girlfriend and one of Nat's business clients, Guy (Simon Baker).Often the formula of rom-coms is that the guy or girl tries to win over someone there are often a series of mishaps and misunderstanding on the way. In I Give It a Year the main two characters are fighting for their marriage as they are two other suitors waiting in the wings. In style I Give it a Year was shot very much like other rom-coms like Bridget Jones, Love Actually and Notting Hill (Working Title made all those films) but I Give It a Year is more of an anti rom-com, being more willing to be risqu√©. There are some twists on typical rom-com clich√©s and there is a fine parody of a famous rom-com speech.I Give it a Year is the first film as a director for Borat writer Dan Mazar and most the humour was sex jokes or awkward/cringe humour and sometimes both. This was all summed up with Stephen Merchant in a show stealing performance giving us his trademark cringe humour and saying very politically incorrect at the most inappropriate times. Olivia Coleman as a bitter man-hating marriage counsellor who has some of the best lines in the film and great physical actions. But some of the jokes are overlong and the first joke where a priest is uncontrollably coughing led to me thinking what have I got myself in for.Spall and Byrne are fine actors. Spall was very good at playing a prat and Bryne was the straight character of the piece. But she is made to be more of the bad guy out of the pair as she is more willing to flirt with Guy and seeks him out as the marriage starts to crumble. The other love interests are also a bit too perfect, even trying to show Guy as the perfect (plus he owns a massive factory in Britain, why not make him British). The supporting cast are solid, particularly Minnie Driver and Jason Flyming as a marriage couple who hard each other.I Give It a Year is a fun film that will delight audiences. The cinema audience I saw it with enjoyed it. There are enough jokes and twists the rom-com genre to keep the film fresh."
Bowling for Columbine,2002,8.0,Filmmaker Michael Moore explores the roots of America's predilection for gun violence.,"What has become of the United States? Is there any difference from the United States that was formed by Puritans and tried to escape from persecution under the British flag? Has there always been a different mentality for the American than that of any other nationality of individual? After September 11th Michael Moore the director and writer set out to make a documentary that addressed these and other embedded questions that are addressed everyday in our news media, school systems, homes, stores and street corners. Attempting to address all sides of the issues as a person of the media Moore used not only his own experiences, his connection to the NRA, but also other persons opinions that ranged from Charlton Hesston, the well known president of the NRA and famous actor, to the average American that was confronted with the violent acts that resulted from the accessibility of fire arms. This documentary took a new approach to the display of information. Not only was animation used to explain history, American's imbedded fear of their own neighbors, but it also used rock music ( gave a beat or a pulse to the film that progress from slow to fast as the intensity of the issues progressed), sarcasm, interviews, and casual conversations. Moore traveled the country to talk to all those that make up the spectrum of the American society, he traveled to the scenes of some of the more recent American tragedies, made impromptu stops in corporations such as Kmart (where the boys from Columbine bought the ammunition used in the shooting), and traveled to Canada to get an outside or foreign opinion. The idea was to move away from the documentary style of `talking heads'; he wanted a film that would not only touch a chord with the American people but one that would also be readily watched. This idea also made the documentary, that there was too much influence placed on the `words of the professional' or the ` findings of the expert'; that these findings and misleadings flooded the news at night to increase the amount of fear that the average American has as it looked for a scape-goat to blame. The information that Moor presented in his documentary did not technically follow a pre-described narrative, but followed more of a form where the audience was left areas to think and to breakdown the information. Elements of the circular narrative were the foundation of the film, where similar elements in opinions and the common American we continually addressed. Yet, the only problem that could be addressed is one of the ways in which Moore collected some of his data. Some might see a use of trickery or manipulation was used on his part to get the responses and such passion-filled opinions stated. While others would see the same information in the light that no instigation was needed, that people have these strong beliefs, opinions and are willing to talk about them but they lack the examples or understanding of the topic to take a well informed stand on one side or the other. Such a problem is not new in the world of documentaries when controversial data is presented to the public. Moore did a great job of presenting a delicate subject to the American people and was deserving of the Academy Award for the project."
Life as We Know It,2010,6.5,Two single adults become caregivers to an orphaned girl when their mutual best friends die in an accident.,"I laughed and cried at the same time watching this movie. The two characters are amazing, funny and beautiful. The comedy part is smart and funny, the drama part is also smart and powerful, the love part is passionate and deep. I recommend this movie to any couple who are thinking of having a baby or to anyone who thinks that he/she is not ready for a relationship.I am sure that this movie changed a lot of our thoughts and ideas. Life is tough and complicated but we have to live it and enjoy it and LOVE. Recently, we hear a lot about ""no strings attached"" and ""friends with benefits"" type of relationships, let me know what you think after watching this movie!"
We Bought a Zoo,2011,7.0,"Set in Southern California, a father moves his young family to the countryside to renovate and re-open a struggling zoo.","""You know, sometimes all you need is twenty seconds of insane courage. Just literally twenty seconds of just embarrassing bravery. And I promise you, something great will come of it."" Benjamin Mee's (Damon) life is starting to crumble. His wife has died, his son is expelled from school and he quit his job. In hopes to start a new life they decide to move and find the perfect house. Then they realize that it's a zoo. I have to admit that I was a little skeptical going in because I thought that it would be a good movie but really cheesy. I really like Cameron Crowe though so I expected it to be good from that. I have to admit that this was one of the best family movies that I have seen in a long time. The movie had enormous heart, depth and tackled real world issues while still appealing to all ages. The writing and the acting were great and the movie absolutely won me over a half hour in. I highly recommend this one. Overall, this is a must see for families and is one to buy so you can watch over and over. I give it an A."
Anywhere But Home,2008,5.7,A couple struggles to visit all four of their divorced parents on Christmas.,"This rudely rambunctious, intermittently funny 2008 holiday comedy is a supreme case of Hollywood overkill along the lines of Jay Roach's ""Meet the Fockers"". Running a scant 89 minutes, it stars no less than five Oscar-winning actors in the standard cookie-cutter story of a commitment-phobic couple who are forced to visit each of their four divorced parents on Christmas day. Co-written by first-timers Matt Allen and Caleb Wilson, along with Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (who co-wrote ""The Hangover""), the premise shows promise with Kate and Brad, a pair of self-satisfied, upwardly mobile San Franciscans meeting for what looks like the first time in a bar. Their sharp-tongued banter turns out to be a role-playing fantasy since they are three years into their comfortable relationship. A major fog blanket rolls over the city and ruins their plans for a holiday vacation in Fiji. What's worse is that they are caught by a local news camera at the airport. Because they deceived their families into thinking they were traveling overseas to help starving third-world children, they embark on a daylong journey to each of their parent's houses, all conveniently located in the Bay Area.However, the movie starts to decline precipitously with each visit. The first home the couple drops by belongs to Brad's redneck father, where his other sons, cage-fighting brothers Denver and Dallas tackle Brad with painful wrestling moves. It ends with an uncomfortable gift exchange where Brad's expensive gifts humiliate his blue-collar family. The couple then visits Kate's overly affectionate mother and a den of cougars, an episode in which it is revealed Kate had a childhood weight problem and a possible lesbian past. Brad's therapist mother is next on the itinerary, but he's still angry that she married his best friend, who is half her age, and a game of Taboo reveals the communication gulf that really exists between Kate and Brad. The last stop is at the home of Kate's father, and this is where the tone gets serious-minded as the couple learns a lesson in the value of being with family in spite of whatever personal differences may exist to divide them the rest of the year.Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon - he with his semi-improvised riffing, she with her exacting intelligence - would seem to be absurdly mismatched, but they spar convincingly, even if they do look more like best friends than lovers. Vaughn gets to shine in a Christmas pageant scene where he basks in the limelight of his ham-fisted stage debut. Robert Duvall, Mary Steenburgen, Sissy Spacek, and Jon Voight play the parents with little screen time, and only Duvall leaves much of an impression as an embittered shell of a man. Jon Favreau, Tim McGraw, Carol Kane, and Kristin Chenoweth gamely play various relatives in equally smallish roles. The whole venture is directed by Seth Gordon, whose only previous feature-length credit is the critically praised video-game documentary, ""The King of Kong"", and his storytelling inexperience shows in the sometimes ADD-level pacing of the story. The 2009 DVD, being released for the holidays, doesn't offer much in terms of extras other than two different screen formats."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,1999,6.7,"Dr. Evil is back and has invented a new time machine that allows him to go back to the 1960s and steal Austin Powers' mojo, inadvertently leaving him ""shagless"".","Picture this: you're home with your friends or family and you have to pick a film. Nothing's really looking good and you just want to stick something on to have a good laugh. Here comes, the Austin Powers trilogy! Out of the three films, this one is one of the funnier instalments. Mike Myers gives a great performance as always, and Rob Lowe gives a great performance (although a very short one). I love the British 60's vibe, since I'm a big vintage fan. It's a good film to put on when you're having a bad day and just need a laugh. No wonder Austin Powers is such an icon nowadays!"
Road Trip,2000,6.5,Four college buddies embark on a road trip to retrieve an illicit tape mistakenly mailed to a female friend.,"You have to thank Something About Mary and American Pie for doing what they did.  These are two movies that came along and were bold enough to try something different. Those films  included raunchy jokes, crude humour, nudity and they had the audacity to poke fun at everyone, call them the Quentin Tarantino of comedies.  Before American Pie, you had some ALMOST good films with Can't Hardly Wait and 10 Things I Hate About You.  They were good but not quite good enough to be mentioned in the same breath as Animal House and Porky's and such.  Then American Pie comes along and shows everyone that it is okay to have boobs again and to use the f-word liberally with lines like "" Sherman, what the f*** are you doing here?"" and "" Oz, F***face, I don't think he's coming back!""  This was a film that didn't try to imitate closely the way teens and young adults talk, it DID imitate the way teens and young adults talk.  Road Trip continues that trend.  Hollywood has to realize when it gives the green light to scripts that we are not as stupid as they think we are, in most cases.  And what I mean by that is simply, sure, it can make money off almost any excuse for a teen film like Drive Me Crazy and Here On Earth and such, but if you want to hit the jackpot, if you want young people to feel the need to see the film more than once and recommend it to their friends, you have to have a smart ear, likable characters to laugh at and more than just a simple boy meets girl story.  Road Trip is that movie!When I went into the film, I was shocked but pleasantly so, to see Ivan Reitman and Dan Goldberg's name attached to the film as executive producers. These are guys that have brought us films like Animal House, Ghostbusters, Meatballs, Stripes and even something like Kindergarten Cop.  These are all funny films with a great ear for dialogue.  So it immediately starts off on the right foot.The next thing it did right is the casting of Tom Greene and Sean William Scott.  Greene is quite sick and twisted by nature and Sean William Scott stole every scene in American Pie.  So to include them in your cast as the raunchiest guys of the bunch is great casting.  The next thing the film does right is it goes back to the roots of campus comedy and it has plenty of nudity.  Yes, sure this may sound sexist and primitive but it also sells tickets.  And they can actually make a case for having it because the story is being told by Greene's character so, as he puts it, "" it is my story, there can be lots of nudity if I want there to be. ""Road Trip has plenty of beautiful women, crude jokes, a nerd that discovers who he is, annebriation, drugs, mean sprited jokes and a script that is more convoluted and conventionally funny than any film save American Pie. Nothing is sacred here.  That includes the blind, obesity, women, animals and of course nerds.This is a fun film and although I am sure that it is garnered more towards males, if you can go in with an open mind anyone can enjoy it.  I will bet that this film will go on to gross about 70 or 80 million dollars and I hope that more films are made in this kind of tradition.  We need more films inspired by Animal House.  We need more characters that are take-offs of John Belushi and Tom Greene.  Maybe Ivan Reitman will have another script like this one on his shelf somewhere and he is ready to dust that one off as well.  Maybe.  All I know is that this film is fresh and it is worth your time.And of course, most importantly, it is one hell of a funny movie!8.5 out of 10"
Spider-Man 2,2004,7.5,Peter Parker is beset with troubles in his failing personal life as he battles a former brilliant scientist named Otto Octavius.,"I recently delved into a spree of superhero movies, but amidst the modern glitz, I felt it was time to revisit a true classic - Spider-Man 2. The movie presents a timeless story with solid tent poles and a strong focus on character development.Upon rewatching, I found myself enthralled once again, appreciating its ability to be repeatedly enjoyed. The visuals, though impressive in their time, might not stand up as strongly in the year 2023. Nonetheless, they still manage to convey the essence of the narrative effectively.While the antagonist could have been portrayed with greater strength, the character's development and writing were commendable, adding depth to the plot. However, it is the protagonist, Peter Parker, who steals the show with his compelling performance, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.In conclusion, Spider-Man 2 remains an awesome classic that stands the test of time. Despite minor visual limitations, the film's engaging story and well-crafted characters ensure you won't be bored, making it a worthy watch for both fans of the superhero genre and newcomers alike."
Donnie Brasco,1997,7.7,An FBI undercover agent infiltrates the mob and finds himself identifying more with the Mafia life--at the expense of his regular one.,"Yes, I am going to make the bold claim that this is his best work. ""Are you talking about the same Al Pacino that did Scarface, Heat, AND the Godfather movies"" you ask. Yes, yes, and let me explain myself. First of all, I want to add that I LOVE Pacino's work. He has such a commanding presence on screen and nobody in cinematic history can scream as well as him (though Gene Hackman is damn good). He can scare the hell out of you with just one crazed look in his eye and he never gives a flat performance (well, except in Revolution).Having said that, I think Pacino is incredible in this flick because his character is so understated. While his work often consists of playing flamboyant, over-the-top, and almost cartoonish figures(especially in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate), this film is a change of pace for him. Sure, he's still playing a mobster, but he's not as psychotic as usual, and for once, you get to see the inner struggles of a crook who deep down has a heart of gold (despite all of the murders). Pacino is perfect as Lefty, an aging crimical who wants out of the mob lifestyle, but doesn't know how to do it. Though you see the fast and fun world of mobsters in flicks like Goodfellas, this film gives you a sense that the mob life isn't that glamorous.Along with Pacino's acting, Johnny Depp is delectable as Joe Pistone (Donnie Brasco) because you can see his inner torment as well. He knows that he's been assigned to infiltrate the New York mob scene, but he develops such a close bond with Lefty that it's almost hard to bring him down. A very real, human relationship permeates between the two that is very moving. I like how the characters are always joking about being a ""wise guy,"" as it provides some light chuckles, and it also shows that in order to live this lifestyle, you've gotta talk tough and act tough (as if I would know what that's like).The supporting cast is particularly noteworthy. Bruno Kirby plays a great weasel, Anne Heche is wonderful as Pistone's neurotic wife (you can understand her suffering, what with being married to an FBI special agent) and Michael Madsen is reliable, once again, as a mobster (honestly, does this guy do anything besides gangster or sci-fi flicks?). Every time I watch this movie I am breathless afterwards. The acting is wonderful, the music is superb, and frankly, I can't believe this stuff actually happened. Then again, I haven't read the book, so I don't know how much of it is true.Overall, this movie gets 10 out of 10. I'm shocked it doesn't get more recognition, especially with such prolific actors as Pacino and Depp leading the way. This is a different kind of mob movie, as it shows a more somber side to this way of life, and I recommend it unequivocally."
Bulletproof,1996,5.8,"Two criminals, Keats and Moses, end their friendship, when Keats turns out to be an undercover cop. Many years later, the two are forced to work together when Keats is assigned to protect Moses as a witness.","Bulletproof is a Fun Movie with nice Action Scenes ,Funny Jokes and a Great Buddy Duo with Adam Sandler and Damon Wayans. They are tons of funny Jokes and both Actors played very well. I don't get the low rating for this very Underrated Action Comedy Gem from the 90s. It's a Fun Movie and clearly one of the best Roles from Adam Sandler. I can Recommend it !"
Austin Powers in Goldmember,2002,6.3,"Upon learning that his father has been kidnapped, Austin Powers must travel to 1975 and defeat the aptly named villain Goldmember, who is working with Dr. Evil.","While the first two Austin Powers films in this comedic series concentrated on spoofing the late '60s/early '70s, James Bond movies and concentrated on female anatomy in the process, this one was centered on penises. I kid you not. (Hence, the title, a play-on-words from ""Goldfinger."")I watched this film twice, within two weeks of each as I showed a friend the second time. The first time I thought it wasn't as funny overall as the other two Powers films and was a bit too raunchy, especially for the PG-13 rating which is ridiculous. After the second viewing, I changed my mind about the comedy (not the rating): it is just as funny if not more than the other two.A couple of the scenes were hilarious, although very crude in spots but some of the crudeness is what makes it funny. However, most of time I laughed more at the many subtle double entendres and all the double takes by Mike Myers, who plays at least four characters in here...all of them very well.It's goofy, stupid and nothing spectacular but definitely fast-moving and entertaining. If you've seen the other Austin Powers films, you know what this basically is going to be, humor-wise.Beyonce Knowles, who played the female lead, didn't have the beauty or body of Heather Graham or Elizabeth Hurley, stars of the other two films, but she isn't bad. There are numerous cameo appearances in here, starting right off the bat with Tom Cruise.Overall: sick (again) but funny (again.)"
The Accidental Husband,2008,5.6,"When talk-radio host Emma Lloyd advises one of her listeners to break up with her boyfriend, the jilted ex sets about getting his revenge.","The reviews for this movie had not been good, although reviews for romantic comedies are notoriously unreliable. RomComs are not high art, and while there is still an abundance of difference between a good RomCom and a bad one, they are light entertainment and benefit from being viewed as such.Accidental Husband certainly had flaws, but was still a lot of fun. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is a funny bloke, Uma is Uma (always at least good), Colin Firth is assured as always. I was impressed with an exchange between Jeffrey and Colin's characters which was unusually realistic for this sort of movie.Some commentators have expressed displeasure at the fate of Colin's character because they like the actor, but it is only a character.The involvement of the Indian family was slightly curious, but enjoyable, and Ajay Naidu put in a solid performance as Deep.If you are after a RomCom and you can cope with a bit of logical nonsense, you should find this an enjoyable diversion."
The Pink Panther 2,2009,5.6,Insp. Jacques Clouseau teams up with a squad of International detectives who are just as bumbling as he is. Their mission: Stop a globe-trotting thief who specializes in stealing historical artifacts.,"I'm not ready to get out the torches and pitchforks and lead a lynch mob after Mr Martin -- not yet anyway! Having read the early reviews here, I went to the cheapo theater with low expectations, and emerged pleasantly surprised. There were some genuine laughs from time-to-time, plus a great cast (shoulda got more out them). My daughter and grandchildren were delighted.The overall plot is reasonably clever -- so, that leaves the gags. Some work - some don't work that well, as evidenced by the fact that many IMDb'ers want to talk about why some of the gags don't 'feel right', or seem to 'take too long'. (No really successful comedians ever had people talk about how their gags don't seem to be working -- people just talk about how much they laughed. When people start analyzing why your comedy isn't funny, it ain't workin'). But we had a few chuckles in this one, if not a bunch of sustained belly laughs.Everyone says we should stop comparing Steve Martin to Peter Sellers, but, if you watched the original films, how can you stop comparing? Sellers created this character, just as Atkinson created Mr. Bean and Cleese created Basil Fawlty. And Steve Martin tries to do Sellers anyway (his 'little yellow friend' line?). He can't quite pull it off, and he hasn't really found a shtick that works. For one thing, his eyes are always popping, like he's trying to pass gas. Sellers' eyes were quiet. His Clouseau was genuinely 'clueless'. And, I've mentioned elsewhere at IMDb that Sellers was a major Radio comedy star before doing films - that puts him in a league with Abbott & Costello, Burns & Allen, Bob Hope and Jack Benny. These guys built amazing gags that kept both live and radio audiences in stitches, using well-constructed devices such as bizarre characterizations, rapid exchanges, and nifty voices. Mr. Martin's roots in comedy are from a different - and later - era.Overall, though, if you need an amusing and harmless diversion, go see this at the reduced-price theater. For $4, I'm in - $20 for a date and me, plus popcorn? where are those torches and pitchforks?6/10 canuckteach"
Despicable Me 2,2013,7.3,"When a new criminal comes to town, the Anti-Villain League decides to hire Gru in order to fight him off. While Gru initially refuses, he eventually agrees after his aide goes back to his evil ways.","It's not often that a hit animated film's sequel surpasses the original film. Despicable Me 2 is one of those rare cases. From the moment it appears on the screen to the end of the film, Despicable Me 2 is a fast paced, fun film that never ceases to be entertaining.This film has you laughing quite often, contains humour that both kids and adults can appreciate, and had at least one moment that was worthy of clapping out loud to.The character development is to be praised, as is the warmth and soul that Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud put into this film.This film leaves you feeling joyful and satisfied and happy for the characters and the new direction their lives are taking.This film is not to be missed and I can't recommend it enough."
Fierce Creatures,1997,6.4,Zookeepers struggle to deal with the policies of changing directors.,"Let me take it out of my system first. There never will be another A Fish Called Wanda. That comedy was one and only, perfect, brilliant, mean, witty, the best film about culture clashes, the best backstabbing comedy, the best - everything. For me, Wanda is a Citizen Kane of the comedy. Period. What makes is outstanding, are the four partners in crime as written by John Cleese and played by Cleese himself, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Palin, and Kevin Kline that were simply incredible, and, let's face it, despite being criminals and back-stabbers, you would love them all. I know I did.When Fierce Creatures was released 12 years ago, I ran to see it and I was bitterly disappointed. I expected Wanda, Part 2 - which is impossible because ...see the first paragraph. Last night I caught FC on TV and I have to admit that it IS a good and funny film. It knows that it is a follow up to A Fish Called Wanda. It references to the perfect predecessor, makes you laugh, and lets you meet again with the fabulous four and many supporting players from Wanda. Fierce Creatures has gained Cult Status with years, and I am now a part of its following. The script was written by John Cleese and the plot is convoluted and silly at the same time. The best, the funniest moments play off mistaken assuming that John Cleese's character Rollo, ex-cop appointed the London Marwood Zoo Director, is a sexy beast for whom one woman is not enough. The scenes between Cleese (Rollo Lee) and Willa Weston, an American business-woman (Jamie Lee Curtis) are the funniest. The weakest links in the movie are IMO Michael Palin who unlike his character Ken in AFCW can talk and he just would never shut up. His character became boring and annoying very soon. The same sadly should be said about Kevin Kline playing two roles, the Australian billionaire Ron McClain, ruthless, obnoxious, and vulgar, and his weakling loser son Vince whom his father despises. Needless to say there is not much love lost between an arrogant father and his estranged son. The film has so many hilarious jokes and witty references not only to A Fish Called Wanda but to Monty Python series that by the time of the conclusion, I had enough fun and laughs to tolerate and forgive the loud and messy final act."
Twins,1988,6.2,"A physically perfect but innocent man goes in search of his long-lost twin brother, who turns out to be a short, womanizing, small-time crook.","Arnold ""is back"" as ""Julius""; the result of a secret genetic experiment to help create a better human being. He has lived a sheltered life on a distant tropical island and has no real practical experience with real life issues; especially with dangerous situations involving criminal activity. He has matured into a kind of naive innocent not unlike anyone you may have found in the proverbial ""Garden of Eden"". His desire to trace his roots leads him to the big city where he soon discovers he has a ""twin"" brother named ""Vincent"" (expertly played by Danny De Vito). Vincent was raised in an orphanage and subsequently has led a life of crime; he seems to favor car theft as his main source of income. These two soon meet and the antics from then on are nothing but hilarious. Arnold attaches himself to Danny like a puppy dog and is very determined to help and protect him. Together, they seek their birth mother as well as get into all sorts of amusing and sometimes potentially dangerous situations. But don't worry fans; with Ah-nold around what could possibly go wrong? Just remember to add this VERY funny movie to your collection of comedies on DVD and remember to pay (or avoid altogether) those parking tickets! Or get a bicycle! Or a scooter! Just don't forget the pop corn!"
Trading Places,1983,7.5,A snobbish Wall Street commodities broker and a wily street hustler find their positions reversed as part of a bet by two callous millionaire brothers who run a brokerage house.,"I couldn't remember much of this movie when I borrowed it from a friend to watch for the second time... I can't have been very old when I first saw this, because there were not much more than one scene that I recognized. Even the title seemed new to me. Furthermore, I don't recall thinking about the film... about what it meant. This contains a lot of sad truth. The scenes of Aykroyd's character going from the peak of America's business life to rock bottom in a disturbingly short amount of time provide food for thought. Landis presents these events without pretense or heavy-handedness... he gives us the facts as they are. No bias. This direct, almost indifferent tone makes it all the more scary... this is the way it is, and that's accepted. The movie also has some insight to prove on racism and greed. Paul Gleason, whom I have only seen in The Breakfast Club(and Not Another Teen Movie, spoofing his character in aforementioned movie) plays a radically different role, yet still shows some of the authority he's famous for as the principal in The Breakfast Club. That was amusing to watch for someone who enjoyed said film so much. Jamie Lee Curtis bares a lot of skin, for those in the audience looking for that. Aykroyd and Murphy are both extraordinary. They get to play with their characters a lot, to great effect. They create so many funny moments, there are simply too many to list or for mere words to do justice; you'll just have to watch the film for itself. If you are a fan of either actor, you won't be disappointed. The language surprised me, with how uncensored it was, compared to today's standards. The plot is interesting, and based on an intelligent idea. The pacing is dynamic. The acting is all top-notch. The humor is mostly good and tasteful, with few but glaringly obvious exceptions(the fate of Beeks being an almost offensive one). The film has more heart than most of its kind... if you watch only one movie of this type, let this be it. I recommend this to fans of the actors and/or director, and people intrigued by the general idea. If you are even considering watching this... take my advice and do so. It is intelligent without being preachy and funny without trying too hard. John Landis has yet again created something big. 8/10"
Bowfinger,1999,6.5,"When a desperate movie producer fails to get a major star for his bargain-basement film, he decides to shoot the film secretly around him.","""Bowfinger"" is one of the funniest movies I have seen in years.  It works because it allows the laughs to build from the way the characters play off each other's personalities, without becoming puppets of the script.  It is for people who love the movies as well, because that's what it's really about; how the movie industry works on such unlikely coincidences, and how the truly desperate are sometimes successful against their own natures.The movie is basically about a group of folks who want desperately to make a movie, to break into the big time.  They are led by Bobby Bowfinger, of ""Bowfinger International Productions"", a hack film ""studio"" in a ramshackle office in an L.A. suburb.  Bowfinger is the right man to head this team; he's unscrupulous, infinitely resourceful, and isn't daunted by the fact that his budget will come from the dollars he saved up each week since he was a kid, stashed in a box in his attic.  He collects his film crew from illegal immigrants trying to cross the border.His accountant has just written a script about aliens hiding in raindrops.  Don't ask, just watch the movie.  The movie is called ""Chubby Rain"".  Bowfinger wants Hollywood's leading action star, Kit Ramsey, to play the lead.  As Ramsey, Eddie Murphy turns out one of his best performances. Ramsey is wildly egotistical and emotionally unstable to a fault. He is a member of ""Mind Head"", one of those many Scientologist-like groups, where he goes often to discuss his many insecurities and paranoid fears, like that of, of course, aliens.Naturally, Ramsey refuses to be in the picture.  That doesn't stop Bowfinger.  He comes up with a clever, if risky, idea: follow Ramsey around, shoot him surreptitiously from a distance, using his own actors to play their parts with him, without Ramsey's knowledge.  This leads to many very funny scenes in which Ramsey comes to believe his paranoid fantasies about aliens are in fact real, while the actors in the movie praise Ramsey's ""style"".Eventually, a stunt double is needed for certain scenes, and a Ramsey look alike, named Jiff, is brought on board.  Jiff is an entirely unique character, played also by Murphy as a slow-witted innocent with a sheepish grin and a nasal voice.  He is lovable and yet annoying at the same time, to Murphy's credit, and a great movie character.I liked a lot of things about the movie, especially the eye it has for the way Hollywood works.  I really enjoyed a scene early on where Bowfinger stages a phony call with a car phone in a restaurant to create an opportunity to pitch his script to a high-powered executive played by Robert Downey, Jr.  Downey is surprised to see the cord dangling from Martin's phone; he may not take him seriously, but he's not likely to forget meeting him.I also liked the way Ramsey complains to his agent about not having a catch phrase the way white action stars have.  His agent points out a scene where he pushes a guy named Cliff off a cliff.  ""That's too cerebral for an audience,"" shouts Ramsey.  ""We're making a movie, not a film!""  He points out that in the script he is reading, the letter ""k"" appears a number of times that is exactly divisible by three, so ""KKK"" appears ""486 times!""What is best about the movie is the way Bowfinger goes for broke, improvising all the way.  He proceeds with a determination fueled by the insane notion that this scheme could actually work.  You have to respect the chutzpah of someone who wants to succeed that badly, even if he bends a few rules along the way."
Zoolander,2001,6.5,"At the end of his career, a clueless fashion model is brainwashed to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia.","A hilarious, ridiculous comedy that does a great job of poking fun at celebrity. Ben Stiller seems to think that fame is rather silly and he shows his contempt for it in the form of male super-model Derek Zoolander.  The intellect-challenged, self-absorbed Zoolander pouts, struts and mispronounces wonderfully throughout this comedy that's aimed at being stupid.The ""plot-line"" begins when Derek is targeted by a clandestine fashion alliance in need of a dim-witted, male super-model.  Fitting the bill to a tee, Derek is brainwashed via a Clockwork-Orange-esque treatment that orders him to kill the visiting Prime Minister of Malaysia, whose progressive take on child-labour laws and sweatshops has become a serious thorn in the side of the fashion cartel. Whenever Derek hears ""Relax"" by Frankie Goes To Hollywood, that's his trigger to kill the Prime Minister.Some movies try so hard at being ridiculous that it actually kills its comedic value (see ""Scary Movie"" and ""Scary Movie 2"").  It's quite a feat to maintain a balance, which Zoolander accomplishes.You'll either love or hate this movie.  If you like silly, you'll like Zoolander. Also, I found that this movie gets better with age, so don't be so quick to cast it aside."
Thanks for Sharing,2012,6.4,A romantic comedy that brings together three disparate characters who are learning to face a challenging and often confusing world as they struggle together against a common demon: sex addiction.,"Somewhere between Indy cinema and mainstream Hollywood as well as treading between comedy and drama, this is not an implication that it suffers from an identity crisis but more of an affirmation that genre boundaries do not have to be definite to produce an acceptable result.The main corpus of the story is three sex addicts and their struggle to overcome it and it makes a point that a paramount factor in recovery is not so much the discipline to abstain from sexual stimulants but being surrounded by people who you can depend upon in the good as well as the bad days. In other words, community is paramount.Overall, it is both a pleasant and poignant story that explores the isolation and darkness associated with this condition. A minus point would be the complete lack of background information on the illness although this is more than compensated in the battle these individual give not only to get better but to be accepted by others.So a film that is both amusing with some is no little thing."
Once Upon a Time in America,1984,8.3,"A former Prohibition-era Jewish gangster returns to the Lower East Side of Manhattan 35 years later, where he must once again confront the ghosts and regrets of his old life.","Reviewers say 'Once Upon a Time in America' is a polarizing film, with opinions varying from masterpiece to overrated. Many commend its epic storytelling, intricate characters, and standout performances by Robert De Niro and James Woods. The non-linear narrative and Ennio Morricone's score receive frequent praise. However, some criticize the film's length, pacing, and controversial scenes, especially the rape scene. Despite these issues, many believe its depth and emotional resonance make it essential viewing."
Zodiac,2007,7.7,"Between 1968 and 1983, a San Francisco cartoonist becomes an amateur detective obsessed with tracking down the Zodiac Killer, an unidentified individual who terrorizes Northern California with a killing spree.","Just a few days ago, my mom and I watched a documentary on the famous Zodiac killer and his victims. It was incredibly interesting so it got me thinking about the film Zodiac that was released this year and lucky enough it was released on DVD today so I rented it. My friend and I just watched it a couple of hours ago and really liked it, especially on how it ended and was over all shot. I thought it was kinda cool how it started off like a documentary type of movie, but then was turning into a thriller that kept you going and guessing, even if you knew the whole story.In the small towns of California, there are several brutal murders, eventually going onto San Fransisco. These murders are extremely violent and very random, and every time it happens there is a message or sign that is left by the killer that calls himself the ""Zodiac"". He sends letters to the press on how and where he killed his victims and teases the police that they will never catch him. But Robert, one of the newspaper cartoonist starts to obsess about the killer, who he is and how they can capture him.With an all star cast, we had absolutely no problem with acting because it was terrific. Jake and Mark held their own very well. The whole story is very chilling and kept you going. The Zodiac Killer is a case that forever will remain a mystery and it was a great idea for a film, Fincher added a Se7en type of feel to this film. It's so funny how I knew the story and how it ended already, but I was actually just waiting to see what would happen in the next scene. I would highly recommend this film to any thriller fan, I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's a great one for 2007.8/10"
Just Like Heaven,2005,6.7,"A lonely architect finds an amazing apartment, only to discover it's haunted by the spirit of the previous tenant, an overachieving doctor.","A rom-com with a twist of the supernatural, which makes the story original. This movie plays wonderfully with the audience's expectations at whether Reese Witherspoon's character Elizabeth is real as her and David (played by Mark Ruffalo) try and figure out why he can only see her etc. There are a couple of good twists later on as they piece things together. Though on meeting they resent each other, they soon start to bond and the resentment turns into romance. The transition between dislike and love is handled extremely well at just the right pace making it believable. The script is surprisingly witty making it smart and the acting between Ruffalo and Witherspoon is really good with a lovely chemistry between them. They are so likable particularly Witherspoon at the start, that you care deeply about them and just root for them to be together.This isn't really funny though I laughed a few times. It's more the comedy that makes you smile as it's charming. There are also some touching scenes as well that tug at the heartstrings but not in a way that's too sentimental like slush. In the end this was a lovely rom-com and even though this came out in 2005, after the recent ones I've seen at the cinema like The Bounty Hunter, The Proposal and The Ugly Truth (which were awful with leads that act sexist and immature and who you can't root for making it unlovable and not funny). Just Like Heaven joins my list of others like Date Night, (500) Days of Summer and arguably the best ever rom-com Love Actually in the likable category. Enjoyable entertainment for it's length that puts a smile on your face. If you haven't seen this yet and want a good rom-com. I would recommend Just Like Heaven because I felt like I was on it with feeling happiness as I watched it. Just lovely."
13 Going on 30,2004,6.3,"Unpopular schoolgirl Jenna Rink makes an unusual wish on her birthday. Miraculously, her wish comes true and the 13-year-old Jenna wakes up the next day as a 30-year-old woman.","This is a very entertaining movie oriented for a teenager audience that is able to enjoy romantic light comedies mixed with fantasy and some situations that deal with the imagination of a young girl.This movie, unlike ""Freaky Friday"" deals with more mature issues such as having a couple, labor life, and more.Still, there's plenty of light comedy and even a great ""Thriller"" choreography. (R.I.P. MJ).So, I can recommend this movie for those who enjoy romantic comedies with a touch of fantasy.Jennifer Garner delivers a funny, super sexy performance. She demonstrates she's a very talented actress when it has to do with comedy.Mark Ruffalo is an underrated actor and delivers a fine performance.Overall this is a funny movie."
Max en de maximonsters,2009,6.7,"Yearning for escape and adventure, a young boy runs away from home and sails to an island filled with creatures that take him in as their king.","A beautiful, audacious, roughly-hewn motion picture (adjectives that are no doubt overused in describing the picture's modus operandi), Spike Jonze's adaptation Maurice Sendak's adored children's book ""Where the Wild Things Are"" taps into the innocent, volatile world of a 9 year old boy the way few mainstream feature films have. It is original, unique, melancholy, and because of this several mainstream critics (and even lucid critics like Salon's Stephanie Zacharek) have derided the film. ""There's no story""; ""kids won't like it""; ""it's an adult film about children, not a children's film""; ""it's boring""; ""the pacing is slow""...What? Why did it become such a crime to make an abstract art film within the spineless confines of the Hollywood system? Doesn't Spike Jonze get credit for personalizing, therefore, retaining a substantial amount of voracity while delving into one of the most revered children's books of the last fifty years? What the hell is wrong with that? I understand that some people just don't respond to the abstract, pseudo-verisimilitude of pretentious art films, but there's a stripped-down purity to this picture that cannot be denied. It's not pretentious, but emotional and honest.It's bold, it takes chances...why is it being chastised in the media? How often do we get movies like ""Where the Wild Things Are""? It should be celebrated, not snidely dismissed (Ex. Lou Lumenick, NY Post)."
"You, Me and Dupree",2006,5.6,"A best man stays on as a houseguest with the newlyweds, much to the couple's annoyance.","This is an extremely lazy slacker comedy. Owen Wilson overdoes his 'aw shucks' charm as a good for nothing who stays on as a house guest with his reluctant best friend. There are some comic moments but the film as a whole simply doesn't work. Why would anyone put up with someone as self-centered and obnoxious as Dupree? The film doesn't even bother to try. Kate Hudson looks good but has little to do. In fact, Matt Dillon and Michael Douglas, all play second fiddle to Owen. With a weak script and few laughs, this is pretty poor stuff,only watchable if you are completely bored.Overall 3/10"
L'auberge espagnole,2002,7.3,"A strait-laced French student moves into an apartment in Barcelona with a cast of six other characters from all over Europe. Together, they speak the international language of love and friendship.","I think anyone who when young has moved to a foreign city, especially alone, would immediately recognize and appreciate the truths apparent in this film. Certainly everyone's experiences are different but some things, the initial disorientation, the difficulties and pleasure of adapting to a new and very different set of friends, the joys of eventual acceptance and adaption of a new routine; these are probably universal. This film depicts all of this very well.The Spanish Apartment rings especially true for me. Almost ten years ago I moved from NYC to Antwerp for one year then on to Barcelona, where I am living still. I was a bit older than the film's characters (late 20 's) but my experience was eerily similar. I lived just blocks away from their apartment, in Raval, and recognized many of the streets and locales. Myself, a Slovak girl I was dating, three male apartment mates from Bolivia, France and Italy. I made tons of expat friends from all over Europe (many of whom departed long ago) and eventually Spanish friends as well.I'm older now and settled down but watching this, I was overwhelmed with nostalgia and wished that I could travel back in time if only to relive one of those glorious weekends.If you've never done anything like this watching The Spanish Apartment may be the next best thing.The Barcelona tourist office should probably pay me for this."
The Heat,2013,6.6,An uptight FBI Special Agent is paired with a foul-mouthed Boston cop to take down a ruthless drug lord.,"This movie is crude, unpredictable, shocking, and just about the funniest female buddy movie I've ever seen. It is a total laugh riot, each shock outdoes the last one. A ""Hangover"" movie for women - and let's hope they make two more of them! Go see it, knowing that the language is foul, the humor is gross, the violence is unexpected, and you will be surprised over and over again anyway. Rarely does a movie audience laugh so loud that you can't hear the dialog. If you are from Boston, or lived there for any appreciable amount of time, it will be even funnier. (""What am I speak-in', f-in' Japanese he-ah?"")Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy are a perfect (mis)-match. A hysterical movie."
The Kids Are All Right,2010,7.0,Two children conceived by artificial insemination bring their biological father into their non-traditional family life.,"'THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)This indie critical darling is one of the best reviewed movies of the year and up until the climax I thought it was a pretty impressive little film. It is a well acted and realistic character study though with the likes of Julianne Moore, Annette Bening, Mark Ruffalo, Josh Hutcherson and 'ALICE IN WONDERLAND's Mia Wasikowska. It's directed and co-written by Lisa Cholodenko and Stuart Blumberg (who also wrote 'KEEPING THE FAITH' and co-wrote 'THE GIRL NEXT DOOR', which I'm a big fan of both). The acting is all impressive, especially Ruffalo and Bening. Moore is good but she's been much better, maybe it's just the character she's playing here that doesn't give her as much to work with. The directing is adequate and fitting to the material and the screenplay is full of natural and believable characters and dialog. Even the ending, which I didn't like, seems believable it's just that it turns the film into a much less valuable learning lesson.The film tells the story of Joni (Wasikowska) and Laser (Hutcherson) a brother and sister conceived through artificial insemination by their unhappy mothers Nic (Bening) and Jules (Moore). Joni is Nic's biological daughter and Laser is Jule's biological son and they were both conceived from the same sperm donor Paul (Ruffalo). On her eighteenth birthday, when she's legally able to do so without the consent of her mother, Joni contacts her biological father and she and Laser meet him secretly. Later their mothers find out about this and before allowing them to see him again demand to meet him as well. Nic, the controlling working mother, is very upset by the sudden involvement of Paul in her children lives but Jules (who has mostly been a stay at home mom) warms to him after he hires her to design and construct his back yard. Paul is a free spirited, fun loving co-op farmer and restaurant owner. This clashes with Nic but the rest of the family enjoys spending time with him and he really learns to love them as well. Complications arise.I was really fascinated by all of the characters and learned to really like them, all except for maybe Nic who was just a little to controlling and self righteous (but believable). Paul to me was the most relate-able and likable character and the story and growth of all of the characters kind of revolve around him. Without giving away too much the movie ends in conflict and one of the characters is sort of used and abused and left with a lot of unfair judgment placed upon him. It is realistic and believable though it just seems like the movie is making heroes out of the wrong characters and villains out of others, that don't deserve it. This left me very much disappointed in the movie as a whole and that's why I can't overwhelmingly recommend it.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOOi1HDSXyA"
The Wolf of Wall Street,2013,8.2,"Based on the true story of Jordan Belfort, from his rise to a wealthy stock-broker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption and the federal government.","Reviewers say 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is a vivid portrayal of greed and excess, with Martin Scorsese's direction and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance receiving acclaim. The film's humor, fast-paced narrative, and satirical take on Wall Street culture are strengths. However, criticisms include excessive debauchery, lack of moral depth, and potential glorification of unethical behavior. Some note the long runtime and repetitive scenes detract from impact. Despite this, the film is praised for bold storytelling, strong supporting performances, and Scorsese's signature style."
Bram Stoker's Dracula,1992,7.4,Centuries-old vampire Count Dracula comes to England to seduce his barrister Jonathan Harker's fianc√©e Mina Murray and wreak havoc in the foreign land.,"... although I keep remembering that this ""modern"" tale was filmed 31 years ago.James V. Hart's script seemed heavily indebted to Fred Saberhagen's The Dracula Tape (1980), which was a re-telling of the events of Bram Stoker's novel from the POV of Dracula, whose POV was missing from the Stoker original. It was also much more favorable towards Dracula, and added a lot of the romantic elements.One thing that it did get right was having all the actual characters from the original novel. Many of the adaptations removed one or more of the suitors, especially the American Quincy Morris, or age up Dr. Seward, or make him the father of Mina or Lucy. This version did present them as they were in the novel.Stylistically, it was unusual even for 1992, with Coppola said to be attempting some sort of visual homage to silent and classic film techniques, with some things looking deliberately artificial.I recall at the time thinking Keanu Reeves was highly miscast, and his awkward performance nearly undid the whole film for me. Anthony Hopkins was coming off his Oscar win for The Silence of the Lambs, and he did seem to have his performance pitched to the rafters. His characterization seemed more in line with the Saberhagen book, where Van Helsing is depicted as more of a religious fanatic with a cruel streak.The whole enterprise was a cash grab for Coppola who was coming off the relative disappointment of The Godfather Part III. It was a success, and kickstarted a ""prestige horror"" trend over the next several years, with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Wolf, and Interview with the Vampire."
The Mist,2007,7.1,"After a massive thunderstorm, an eerie, unwavering fog descends upon a Maine community. Locals seek refuge in a grocery store from the monstrous creatures now roaming the countryside killing everyone they encounter.","Frank Darabont returns to the Stephen King well once again and this one is my personal favorite. I have a soft spot for horror stories, I know The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile are both much more subtle artistic masterpieces of modern cinema, I watch those films quite often and they tug at my heart strings each and every time. This film, however, is a fantastic character study with a subtly layered screenplay, powerful performances from it's ensemble of movie stars and ""hey it's that guy!"" character actors that also just so happens to include expertly directed gut wrenching sequences of horrorific monsters. It's a truly spooky film unlike most modern horror films. Darabont puts you right there in that supermarket, surrounded by panicked townsfolk and religious nutcases. Not only is the film scary, it's painfully tragic. I don't want to spoil the ending because it's so incredibly powerful so I'll say as little as I can but just don't expect every character that you've grown to love to make it out unscathed. This film has immense rewatchability unlike so many horror films that are meant to shock you momentarily with a jump scare then laugh it off with a quip. This is NOT that kind of film. Yes things get shocking but they're earned shocks and not just a series of the filmmakers shouting BOO!"
The Fighter,2010,7.8,"Based on the story of Micky Ward, a fledgling boxer who tries to escape the shadow of his more famous but troubled older boxing brother and get his own shot at greatness.","Reviewers say 'The Fighter' is lauded for its strong performances by Christian Bale, Melissa Leo, and Amy Adams, offering depth and authenticity. The film is appreciated for its realistic boxing portrayal and gritty setting. However, some criticize its clich√©d plot, lack of character development, and uneven pacing. Boxing scenes, though realistic, are less engaging than dramatic elements. Mark Wahlberg's lead performance is seen as less compelling compared to the supporting cast. Overall, it's a solid, though not exceptional, sports drama."
Water,2005,7.6,"Set in colonial India against Gandhi's rise to power, it's the story of 8-year-old Chuyia, who is widowed and sent to a home to live in penitence; once there, Chuyia's feisty presence deeply affects the lives of the other residents.","I just saw this last night at the TIFF with no expectations (originally didn't even want to see it). But what an enjoyable film this was!!! The dialogue was quite witty, the stars were attractive and gave very believable performances (my friend said that she was so drawn into it that she forgot those people were just acting and weren't really living the life of the characters). The story had the audience empathize with the situation and all those involved, with lightened bits of humour intermixed with sad/dramatic parts throughout.What captivated me the most was how beautifully filmed each scene was (in that respect, it reminded me of House of Flying Daggers). The stunning cinematography, vivid colours were all so carefully planned. In every frame, I can envision a beautiful photograph which can be composed from it.The score was also very good and added to the mood of the film.Go see it if you have the opportunity, you will not be disappointed (oh, might want to bring some Kleenex tho').oh, and since it was at TIFF, Deepa spoke a few words (she appears to be very down to earth and sincere) and the cast was also present (John Abraham and Lisa Ray are absolutely gorgeous but very modest and subtle). These people did such a fabulous job, but remain so approachable and true. Am so proud of them!!!!"
Coach Carter,2005,7.3,Controversy surrounds high school basketball coach Ken Carter after he benches his entire team for breaking their academic contract with him.,"'Coach Carter' is based on a true story of Coach Ken Carter, a controversial high school basketball coach played by Samuel L. Jackson. Coach Carter took the coaching job under his rules. He believed that the players must maintain good grades and become a united team or they would not play. All the team players signed his contract to do just that. The team was undefeated and on it's way to the 1999 State Championship, when Coach Carter received the low grades of his players. Coach Carter received national attention when he locked the gym and benched the whole team for poor grades. Coach Carter received some praise and much more criticism for his decision. This is a good inspirational movie of what one must do to excel in sports and in life. Coach Carter taught his players that they must be committed and work hard to excel. This is good movie for people who like sports. (Paramount, Run time 2:16, Rated PG-13)(8/10)"
Rocky Balboa,2006,7.1,"Thirty years after the ring of the first bell, Rocky Balboa comes out of retirement and dons his gloves for his final fight against the reigning heavyweight champ Mason 'The Line' Dixon.","I've been able to see this before it's release date so I'll avoid giving too much away in this review. To start with when I heard that they were going to make a sixth Rocky movie you didn't have to be a die hard fan to wonder what were they thinking about, particularly 15 years after the last horrible outing! After 30 years since the original ROCKY was released one could only wonder what else they could conjure up after such a long hiatus? Yet this movie was not bad and it's important to stress that on a number of levels. This rendition of Rocky is true to the previous ones as again he is the underdog, a former champ who is encouraged to come out of obscurity and take on the current champ despite having been retired for 20 years.Just to recap to the earlier movies for the moment, in the original ROCKY, in some sort of bizarre publicity stunt Rocky Balboa was plucked up from a short list of ""bum of the month contenders"" to leap frog genuine challengers for a crack at the undisputed heavy weight title. Although he falls short, because of the effort and the show that he puts on, the public demand a rematch and consequently sequel to ROCKY is made and so on. It's important to remember that in the 1970's the American public craved for there to be white heavyweight boxing champion so when the original ROCKY was released not only was it contemporary but captured the imagination of the public at the time. Apollo Creed as the champion was obviously modeled on the brash, cocky Muhammad Ali who you either loved or hated.Also it's worth noting that in the 1970's and 80's boxing enthusiasts often wondered who would win in a fictional fight between the 1950's champion Rocky Marciano and the 1970's champ Muhammad Ali. Therefore it was no coincidence the name 'Rocky'was used in the 70's, but now today in ROCKY BALBOA we are now asking who would win in 2006, Rocky from the 70's and 80's or Mason Dixon from the 2000's? The question in this movie is actually more like a Rocky Marciano v's Ali now than it was in the 70's!Another point worth mentioning is that in the original the conceited Apollo Creed was a flashy, arrogant, publicity seeking showman, but more importantly he was human. By the time of Clubber Lang and Ivan Drago in ROCKY'S III and IV respectively the Italian Stallion was up against fighters that did not seem to be human. They were void of feelings had no family and their physical prowess and abilities were so advanced that they seemed more like comic book or video game characters. In this movie Mason Dixon to a large extent returns the heavyweight champion to a more believable human role, although contemporary for 2006 i.e. athletic, brash and mean! I give credit to the writers here and to a large extent this is where the movie worked!I don't know if it was a coincidence or if it was part of the thinking but ROCKY BALBOA was fortunate enough to be released at a time when the heavyweight boxing scene itself is in a shambles and resembles a three ring circus. From blown up middleweights to an alphabet soup of nobodies in their late 30's right up to a 7 foot Neanderthal lookalike that is totally useless,--- heavyweight boxing has never been more of a joke! In a time when top athletes in their respective sports are stronger, faster or bigger and more powerful than there peers from earlier decades, heavyweight boxing is about the only sport to have regressed. The skill levels and talent are so much poorer than their counter parts in the 1970's and 80's that none of them could even carry Muhammad Ali or Larry Holmes jock strap's when they were at their best! The International powers that be have in there zeal for money have butchered the world heavy weight boxing scene so badly that its turned into a freak show. Thus the idea of a former champion 25 years past his best challenging for a world title is not as far fetched as it once might have been!This movie will have it's critics and while it is certainly not flawless I see no reason why this movie should be lambasted as it no doubt will be. At the very least it stands out from being better than 90% of the movies that are released today, many which are simply dreadful. If old 1960's,70's and 80's TV shows are revived on the big screen for the movie industries indulgence or else the public are fed an endless list of remakes why not another Rocky movie! The dialogue and writing while not great was no worse anything else I've seen recently and the production and camera angles were good. It's slow in certain areas particularly at the beginning but over all a nostalgic effort which tried to capture the theme of the earlier rocky movies. Apparently Sylvester Stallone was never happy about ROCKY V and for years the memory of it tormented him, well I think this one will have exorcised that demon ,a much better effort overall. Check it out!"
Remember the Titans,2000,7.8,"In 1971, Virginia high-school football was everything to the people of Alexandria, but when the school board was forced to integrate an all-Black school with an all-white one, the foundation of football's tradition was put to the test.","Based on real events in 1971, where T.C. Williams High School, a now hot bed integrated school, becomes a beacon of unification via their mixed race football team.As is normally the case with films of this ilk, it quickly comes to pass that certain artistic licence has been taken with the truth. In reality the issues of race, integration and the near powder-keg atmosphere portrayed in the picture, were long past their worst in Virginia 1971. However, that should in no way detract from the thematics and truthful aspects of this Disney production. As is told in the film, the Titans did have what became known as the perfect season, whilst the bond formed between the black and white members most definitely existed. All told, the film soars high as an inspirational piece, not only for the mixed race community coming together plot's essential being, but in the crucial tale of one Gerry Bertier.That this film urged me to seek out the story of Bertier is a testament to the power of film, regardless of any sort of sentimental prodding from the film makers. It's hoped that this film also prompts newcomers to research further the topics within the story.The cast list is impressive, Denzel Washington and Will Patton find instant chemistry as the head coaches thrust together by outside influences, with both guys beautifully doing credit to the real life friendship that would be born from the situation. Ryan Hurst, Wood Harris, Ethan Suplee, Donald Faison, Kip Pardue, Craig Kirkwood and a pre-fame Ryan Gosling fill out the integrated football team. With two important family roles nicely portrayed by Hayden Panettiere and Nicole Ari Parker. The soundtrack is nicely put together, with the core offering of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell's thumping rendition of ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" particularly potent and uplifting.Though not primarily offering up anything new in the pantheon of race and sport related movies, Remember The Titans does have so much good going for it. It's hard to be picky, even churlish about the little faults (are these actors really the age of high schoolers for example?). So hopefully come the end, after the credits roll, you will be suitably inspired, and perhaps a touch more better off for having spent time with this particular football team. 8.5/10"
Rocky II,1979,7.3,"Rocky struggles in family life after his bout with Apollo Creed, while the embarrassed champ insistently goads him to accept a challenge for a rematch.","I have to hand it to Sylvester Stallone ¬ñ he did the impossible with 'Rocky II' and made a successful follow-up to 'Rocky,' winner of the 1976 Best Picture Academy Award.Some argue that 'Taxi Driver' (also nominated) deserved the Oscar more. I'm not so sure. 'Rocky' came along at just the right time ¬ñ it was an uplifting story and people needed that back then. Now, 'Taxi Driver' is usually considered the superior of the two ¬ñ but they're entirely different and, in my opinion (and it's a rare one), 'Rocky' is just as good ¬ñ but in a different way. They're both great films, and I'm not saying that 'Taxi Driver' shouldn't have won ¬ñ but I'm not necessarily saying it should have, either. 'Rocky's' achievement is monumental and it is one of the greatest films ever made. To say it's 'not as good' merely because it is more optimistic is nonsense.So what's so great about 'Rocky II' and why is it generally underrated? (Its average user score right now on the Internet Movie Database -- with over 8,000 votes -- is a measly 6.2/10, compared to the original's 7.7)Because it maintains the focus of the first film, and continues the story rather well. A story that didn't really need to be continued, per se, but nevertheless formed the foundation of one of the greatest film franchises of all time. That's right ¬ñ many people hate the 'Rocky' sequels, but apart from 'Part V,' they're all surprisingly entertaining ¬ñ and, more importantly, well made. I like them; they entertain me, and I think they all serve their purpose.What's particularly interesting about 'Rocky II' is that apart from repeating the central theme of fighting Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), Rocky (Stallone) goes through a character arc here that many sequels totally ignore ¬ñ we see the after-effects of his fight, and him struggling to adapt to the 'New Life.'Rocky is not a smart person. But he is one of cinema's deepest characters. Stallone (who wrote all the scripts and directed three of the sequels) succeeds at evolving Rocky's self-confidence. After winning a small fortune from his famous fight with Creed, he goes out on an impulsive shopping spree, buying a cool car, a new leather jacket (with a tiger ¬ñ the beast with the 'eye' that Rocky re-captures in 'Part III' ¬ñ printed on the back), and a new luxurious apartment for him and his wife Adrienne (Talia Shire).The problem is that Rocky soon runs out of money. His happy-go-lucky personality crashes when he is faced with the prospect of losing it all. He promised Adrienne never to fight again, and keeps his word by trying to get a 'real' job at the meat-processing factory (the same one he trained at in the original film). However due to staff cut backs he is fired and soon realizes that he was born for one reason: To fight.Meanwhile, Apollo is eager to take on 'The Italian Stallion' again ¬ñ to prove he isn't the coward that criticizers are implying he is. He entices Rocky back into the ring for a final match ¬ñ and to say that the outcome is satisfactory is an understatement.Most people seem to forget that Stallone is almost solely responsible for the entire success of 'Rocky' as a whole. He came up with the idea, wrote a script, fought to get it made, fought to become the leading star, and literally fought to get in shape. All of this fighting paid off ¬ñ and it continued to pay off as he kept on cranking out all the sequels.Indeed, the 'Rocky' legacy is often poked fun at because it is the typical endless Hollywood moneymaking franchise. But 'Rocky II' and 'III' (more so than the other two sequels) have guts, power, determination and focus ¬ñ they've got the so-called 'Eye of the Tiger' and I can't really say that I agree with anyone who says these movies are worthless. They aren't masterpieces but they certainly aren't trash, either. I give 'Rocky II' a hearty recommendation ¬ñ it's a truly solid sequel that surprises us right when we expect to be disappointed."
Any Given Sunday,1999,6.9,A behind-the-scenes look at the life-and-death struggles of modern-day gladiators and those who lead them.,"I don't intend to add to the many positive comments about this movie.  I agree with them.  But from another perspective:First, I have never been a football fan.  However, any movie that combines Oliver Stone and Al Pacino has to get my interests. I loved it.One thing that did impress me more than anything else was the quality of the sound design.  The 3 dimensional noises in the huddle, on the line, from the grandstands; the growls and other sounds from the players; these things made the movie live and my blood boil.  I was breathless.Then these things interspersed with dead silences and slow motion dreamlike sequences gave the action a spiritual quality.I stayed for the credits to see who had done this sound work and I think Wylie Stateman will get, at the very least, an Oscar nomination for sound design.  If you ever wondered what this credit meant, see this movie and you will know. This movie would have lost a great deal of its punch without that sound designer's talent."
Donnie Darko,2001,8.0,"After narrowly escaping a bizarre accident, a troubled teenager is plagued by visions of a man in a large rabbit suit who manipulates him to commit a series of crimes.","I love everything about this film! It's been among my favorites for many years. The theories that could be well in depth for hours, the soundtrack, sweet camera shots, and the brilliant writing! I'm proud of the fact that this is my 300th review on here. I'd say this is my 4th favorite film ever after Fight Club, The Matrix, and True Romance. The floating wormholes is super cool to me and the soundtrack is so damn good!Thought provoking films are my favorite ever, the fact that you could float on talking about different aspects and possibilities is beyond fascinating to me! It's extremely impressive that Richard Kelly was 26 when he wrote the script and made such a profound experience!"
Az √∂t√∂dik pecs√©t,1976,8.5,"In Budapest in 1944, a watchmaker, a book seller and a carpenter are drinking in a bar with the owner, when they are joined by a stranger. The watchmaker asks a hypothetical question that will change their lives.","Gets off to an amazing start, with the first 40 or minutes or so being confined to one location, and centring on five men having intense philosophical/political conversations. One stirs things up as the evening's winding down, then everyone's a mess for the second act, and then this war drama becomes a bit more of a war film in its final act, and it kind of comes together... well, it comes together enough.So where the film ends up certainly isn't terrible, but could perhaps be a bit on the nose. I think The Fifth Seal really flounders throughout its second act, though, and makes the whole thing feel a bit uneven.I can't deny there are some amazing parts to this film at least, most of them contained to the first 40-ish minutes of the film."
The Pledge,2001,6.7,A retiring police detective pledges to catch the killer of a young child.,"Having seen ""The Pledge"" without knowing much about it, I got something other than what I bargained for. But that's not necessarily a bad thing.If you're looking for a good whodunit, avoid this movie. If you're looking for a fast-paced thriller, avoid this movie. But if you're into seeing an intense character study bolstered by impressive acting and clever directing (kudos, Sean Penn), you've come to the right place.I read one IMDB review calling this film Nicholson's worst ever. This is not true -- that reviewer obviously never saw ""Man Trouble"" -- but I can see why some folks really don't like this movie. It doesn't deliver what you'd expect, and what it does deliver is neither conventional nor uplifting. In fact, it's pretty depressing. But if you ponder the story afterward, you realize there's a certain dark justice at work here. Like, blacklight dark.So then, ""The Pledge"" is not a light and frothy piece, but if you're the type who thinks watching some poor b**tard's descent into madness is entertainment, have at it."
Dead Man Walking,1995,7.5,"A nun, while comforting a convicted killer on death row, empathizes with both the killer and his victim's families.","Him, along with certain actors are touched by God. Meryl Streep, Kathy Bates, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman, Katherine Hepburn, Bogart, Anthony Hopkins, Day-Lewis, Denzel, Nicholson, Caine, the list goes on.My husband and I tend to watch actors that we love and then watch all of their movies. Sean Penn has an amazing body of work. We don't care if an actor truly transforms themselves to play a role (but that's impressive) as much as we care about how authentic a performance is. For example, Michael Caine is pretty much always similar and yet he's compelling in every performance he's ever given. But Sean Penn gives a performance here that is next level. Touched by God is the only way to describe it."
Jackie Brown,1997,7.5,"A flight attendant with a criminal past gets nabbed by the ATF for smuggling. Under pressure to become an informant against the illegal arms dealer she works for, she must find a way to secure her future without getting killed.","Out of all the films in Tarantino's career as director, JACKIE BROWN is the one people are least likely to have seen. This may be because it's the director's most subtle and relaxed movie, and also the only one in which the material he directs isn't his own; instead this is an adaptation of an Elmore Leonard novel. This doesn't mean it's at all bad, and in actual fact it's entertaining to watch Tarantino try something different for a change.Of course, his trademarks are still apparent for the fans. The dialogue is as zippy and frenetic as ever, and the characters the usual bunch of double-crossing low-lifes you'd expect to see in RESERVOIR DOGS and PULP FICTION. There's a huge set-piece late on in which takes place in a shopping mall that manages to be just as entertaining as the chop-em-up showdown of KILL BILL: VOLUME 1 even if the on-screen events are more laid back.As with every other Tarantino movie I've seen (all of 'em, with the exception of DEATH PROOF), the cast is remarkable for its breadth and daring. Once again, Tarantino isn't afraid to pick forgotten or non A-list types as central characters. When he incorporates A-listers, like De Niro here, he does an about turn and casts them against type. It pays off. De Niro is hilarious as a no-good hoodlum and seems to be loving the chance to play something other than a slick mob boss.Elsewhere, we get cult favourite Robert Forster (ALLIGATOR) who gives what I think is his best ever performance; Michael Keaton, playing a pretty weird/wired cop; Bridget Fonda as a stoner; Chris Tucker, not annoying for once; Samuel L. Jackson as a cold-blooded, almost reptilian character and, of course, Pam Grier. While I appreciate Grier's iconic status - I've seen a fair few of the '70s flicks that made her famous - I don't think she's quite the actress that Tarantino hoped for when casting her, but she's adequate at least. Add in a Sid Haig cameo and there you have it: a typically offbeat, original and enjoyable Tarantino outing with a cast to die for."
Hot Shots! Part Deux,1993,6.6,"""Rambo"" parody in which Topper Harley leads a rescue team into Iraq to save Iraqi war prisoners and all of their previous rescue teams.","I don't know if I've ever seen a comedy as zany or as randomly silly as ""Hot Shots! Part Deux."" Then again, I'm not all that familiar with the comedy genre, but I can say that between this movie and its predecessor, every pratfall, every parody, every little joke has been done. Part Deux is even crazier and more random than its nonsensically silly prequel and it's even less intelligent, but strangely enough, it's a lot more enjoyable. I thought the first ""Hot Shots!"" was a promising hit-and-miss satire; Part Deux succeeds.Like its predecessor, Part Deux sets its plot as a parody of one specific film, but makes satirical parodies of dozens throughout its running time. The first movie was a parody of ""Top Gun"" but made references to dozens of other movies from ""Dances With Wolves"" to ""Gone with the Wind."" Likewise, the sequel is a parody of ""Rambo III"", but that's just the setup for all of the jokes that follow. Like Rambo, Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) is retired to the Far East when his former commander (Richard Crenna) comes in and asks him to join a rescue mission to save hostages from Iraqi captors. Sheen at first refuses but when Crenna is captured as he was in ""Rambo III"", Sheen heads in after him along with a misfit group of soldiers. And meanwhile, Admiral Benson (Lloyd Bridges) from the first movie has been promoted to president of the United States and continues his idiotic and incompetent running of the country.Now this is precisely the sort of comedy that a movie-lover like myself enjoys. Why? Well, not only because it is so zany and buffoonish that one can't help but laugh at it, but because it's like a big mincemeat of movie references. The setup is a parody of ""Rambo III"", but I spotted parodies of ""Casablanca"", ""Platoon"" (which also starred Charlie Sheen), ""Lady and the Tramp"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Terminator 2"" and so on. And just when I thought they were going to between two movies forget to parody ""Star Wars"", sure enough I got my fix for that. And that's not even the limit of it. The movie also makes jokes and points fingers at some of your favorite actors. A brief example is an enemy patrol boat that comes into the shot. The boat's name is ""The Behn Gazaarah"" as a tribute to actor Ben Gazzara. If you've seen lots of movies and you love the movies, this is the comedy for you because you can sit back, relax, have the time of your life laughing, and point your finger at the screen whenever a parody comes up and say ""Yeah, that was from (insert movie title)!"" ""Hot Shots! Part Deux"" opens up with a joke and closes with a joke and at least ninety percent of these are gut-busting in their effect. There are some jokes throughout the film, such as a few of the Saddam Hussein jokes toward the beginning, that were not all that funny, but around and after that were some of the zaniest, silliest, most random pratfalls I've ever seen. But it's also funny because it doesn't just make a simple parody and joke, but keeps pushing it one step ahead. Instead of just simply parodying the spaghetti-kiss scene from ""Lady and the Tramp"", it carries it to the next step with Charlie Sheen pushing a meatball across the plate with his nose and then the scene morphs in a parody of ""Casablanca."" It's also not just enough for the movie to create a character like Richard Crenna's character in the Rambo series to be Sheen's former commanding officer. But to have Richard Crenna himself play the character and wear the same outfit and the same makeup and speak in the same rhythm and manner.And if there is one other element in this movie that I loved, it was the Lloyd Bridges character. Like the admiral he played in the first ""Hot Shots!"" Bridges plays the president of the United States, Thomas ""Tug"" Benson as simply a complete idiot, somebody so stupid that they could never, in real life, get a job running a grocery store let alone a country. And Bridges looks like he's having a good time playing the character, which in turn makes it very funny for the audience.In closing, ""Hot Shots! Part Deux"" is a tremendously enjoyable satirical comedy and precisely the sort of parody that I find entertaining. The key to its success is that it's so unbelievably random and silly and nonsensical. Whereas so many comedies I know try to do the same thing but just fail, it passes with flying colors. This is one funny movie."
Fargo,1996,8.1,Minnesota car salesman Jerry Lundegaard's inept crime falls apart due to his and his henchmen's bungling and the persistent police work of the quite pregnant Marge Gunderson.,"Reviewers say 'Fargo' is acclaimed for its dark comedy and crime drama, highlighting the Coen brothers' distinct style. Frances McDormand's performance as Marge Gunderson is particularly lauded. The Minnesota setting enhances the film's atmosphere, blending tension with humor. Black humor, violence, and satire are noted as key elements. The dialogue's wit and realism contribute to the engaging narrative. Despite some critiques on pacing and character depth, 'Fargo' stands out in the Coen brothers' work."
27 Dresses,2008,6.1,"After serving as a bridesmaid 27 times, a young woman wrestles with the idea of standing by her sister's side as her sibling marries the man she's secretly in love with.","Romantic comedies are almost always predictable and follow similar story lines. I wasn't very keen on watching '27 Dresses'. Let's just say it's not my kind of film. But it turned out to be not too bad. While it does not exactly rank among the best of its genre, it has its own charm and that's one of the few things that make a romantic comedy likable. While the story isn't new, McKeena's writing offers some new devices and the dialogues are quite funny. Fletcher's storytelling is quite impressive too as he introduces the characters and then lets the events unfold. The layered characters Jane and Kevin are very real. I also like it when the leads are played by good actors who have hardly attempted to do films romantic comedies in the past and they manage to pull it off. Heigl and Marsden have the required chemistry. Both actors do a fine job. Katherine Heigl brings out the depth of her character with ease, while James Marsden is funny without going over-the-top. The sizzling Malin Akerman does well as the obnoxious Tess. Edward Burns's role doesn't require much but he's okay. Judy Greer is brilliant and she owns all her scenes. So what makes '27 Dresses' watchable is the chemistry between the actors, the funny lines, the presentation of the story, a nice soundtrack and its unique charm and sense of humour and the fact that it didn't bore me."
Inkheart,2008,6.1,"A teenage girl discovers her father has an amazing talent to bring characters out of their books and must try to stop a freed villain from destroying them all, with the help of her father, her aunt, and a storybook's hero.","Mo (Brendan Fraser) is good father, happily married who has a special talent to bring personages out of books.

Martian Child,2007,6.7,A widowed science-fiction writer considers adopting a six-year-old outcast who thinks he's an alien from Mars.,"What would be different about a child from the planet Mars than one born on Earth? No one knows, since for all practical reasons no one has ever meet a Martian Baby. David (John Cusack) a widowed science fiction writer, with writer's block decides to find out, by adopting an unwanted boy. The boy, Dennis, (Bobby Coleman) outwardly acts as if he is a child from our closest celestial neighbor, the planet Mars. David and Dennis appear well suited for each other because they are both living apart from society. David does so by living alone and writing science fiction novels up until the present time of his wife's death, now he is just alone. Dennis, avoids contact with everyone by taking on the guise of the child from Mars, an alien, a stranger, who acts differently than the norm, and therefore society avoids confrontation with what is unusual. This screenplay is adult in nature because it deals with issues that are unpleasant and upsetting. Taking on the responsibility of rearing an unwanted child, alone, having never actually been a parent, and never knowing if the love you give is going to be returned is a huge step! This is a film that will be appreciated by a very small audience. One must first be able to get past self indulgence and reach a certain level of maturity before one can consider taking on the total responsibility of another life form. Director Menno Meyies has created a very strong bond between David and Dennis in their scenes throughout his film. Unfortunately most of the people on this planet will never see their performances. Go out of your way, go alone if you must, but go see the Martian Child. If you are a parent it will remind you of raising your own children, if you are not yet a parent it will remind you of the childhood you had and the experience of raising your own Martian Child yet to come!"
28 Days,2000,6.1,A big-city newspaper columnist is forced to enter a drug and alcohol rehab center after ruining her sister's wedding and crashing a stolen limousine.,"It may be listed as one, but it is a serious subject. Some parts are stupid, but then again, things we do in life are sometimes stupid. Being the son of an alcoholic and having my own issues...I get it. Addiction sucks big time. The things they say about it are very true. This movie is not for everyone, but for me it was done well enough for me to realize some things about myself. No movie will ever be perfect about addiction and, of course, they need to lighten if up enough to get audience members. I personally like where she finally starts to realize things. And of course, you can slip now and then until it finally catches on."
The Transporter,2002,6.8,"Frank Martin, who ""transports"" packages for unknown clients, is asked to move a package that soon begins moving, and complications arise.","Jason Statham plays the Transporter, an ex-military man who will move anything that needs to be moved...no questions asked. He has three simple rules. But when he breaks his cardinal rule, no peeking, he opens a varitable pandora's box that he might not survive. Statham plays one cool character. I could see him as a serious action hero type. The project was spearheaded by Luc (The Professional) Besson and directed by Cory Yuen. The film has high energy and is a load of fun. The fighting scenes are cool and the beginning and ending sequences are a blast. Forget the Fast and the Furious use The Transporter 8/10"
Rush Hour 3,2007,6.2,"After an attempted assassination on Ambassador Han, Lee and Carter head to Paris to protect a French woman with knowledge of the Triads' secret leaders.","Should movies make money, then the Hollywood rule of thumb is to make another, and another, until the franchise runs out of steam. The original Rush Hour was a Jackie Chan vehicle of sorts to break into Hollywood, and it made a lot of money with the mis-pairing opposite Chris Tucker in a buddy cop movie formula filled with action and comedy. Rush Hour 2 was made 3 years later and made even more money, but it took 6 years for the second sequel to be made, and 9 years for the entire trilogy to be done (pray tell, will there be another sequel?)Is the franchise tired? Probably, yet probably not. Face it, it's Jackie Chan, and most of his films (with the exception of missteps such as Around the World in 80 Days) make Hollywood studios smile. You can rely on him to deliver the goods in any action comedy, but age unfortunately has caught up with him, not to mention as well the safer-than-safe minimal risks that studios in the West tend to take with its stars. The action sequences in Rush Hour 3 look a bit tired, tame, and very uninspiring, and what Jackie Chan can probably still do, has been whittled down to sequences that are just a pale shadow of what could have been.Which leaves us with the comedy, thankfully still having its moments especially for those punchlines which deliver. Tucker again gets most of the snarky lines, and a target for those politically incorrect jokes, while dishing some of his own. If there's any hint of rudimentary character development after these years, is that his James Carter, besides having been relegated to traffic duties, managed to ""half-chinese"" himself, and no longer is that helpless cop who without his gun, can't kick a ball for nuts.The plot is no rocket science, and in fact, the previous two movies just had something which could coast along from scene to scene, providing a platform either to get our heroes Lee (Chan) and his brother-from-another-mother James (Tucker) into fisticuffs, or provide something for laughs. The first had a kidnapping of a Chinese Consul's daughter which the duo had to investigate in the US, while the second brought them to Hong Kong on the trail of a counterfeiting scam. The third pits the detectives against Triads, and brings us full circle with the return of that little girl in the original movie, who's now all grown up, played by Chinese starlet Zhang Jingchu.Zhang Jingchu follows in the footsteps of fellow compatriot Zhang Ziyi who starred in the previous sequel. But unlike Ziyi, Jingchu's role is sans martial arts, despite her character being a kungfu instructor. It's unfortunately a purely flower vase role, though she looks more fleshed and healthier than her druggy role in Prot√©g√©. Yvan Attal's supporting role as a French cab driver is actually more of a scene stealer - listen out for those jibes at America, though it's a little of a cop out how that eventually plays out. Some of the more totally insane moments involve those deliberate lost in translation moments, which are the more enjoyable moments in this movie.Rush Hour 3 is similar in structure with its predecessors, and it does seem a tad familiar at times in the way the story gets developed, with only a change in locale, now set in Paris. It's basically an attempt to reunite the two stars in order to make another dent in the box office, so though they're back, this movie can't be taken all too seriously. It plays out like a cartoon for adults, though the local distributor decided to edit portions of the French revue scene to obta in a rating that everyone can go to.If anything, stay behind for the outtakes, which triumphs over the main offering, hands down."
Black Hawk Down,2001,7.7,"The story of one hundred and sixty elite U.S. soldiers who dropped into Mogadishu in October 1993 to capture two top lieutenants of a renegade warlord, but found themselves in a desperate battle with a large force of heavily armed Somalis.","Reviewers say 'Black Hawk Down' is lauded for its intense action, realistic war portrayal, and strong performances by Josh Hartnett and Tom Sizemore. Ridley Scott's direction and Hans Zimmer's score receive acclaim. Criticisms include lack of character depth, historical inaccuracies, and pro-American bias. Some find it overly violent, while others appreciate its raw depiction of the Battle of Mogadishu. The portrayal of Somalis and omission of political context are contentious. Despite flaws, many consider it a gripping war film."
Ghosts of Girlfriends Past,2009,5.8,"Spirits of jilted lovers take a handsome, successful photographer on an odyssey through his many failed relationships.",The film started out a little slowly but began to move well. I thought that there was really good chemistry between the two main characters. I liked the film for its well conveyed message about commitment and what it means to care for people. In order to receive you need to give and vice versa. The film used Dickens as a clever vehicle for its plot and it worked for me anyway. I am not saying the film is a classic but it was a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours and I definitely would recommend it to people I know. I thought that the acting was terrific and the characters were well developed. I think the film is definitely worth seeing.
The Golden Compass,2007,6.1,"In a parallel universe, young Lyra Belacqua journeys to the far North to save her best friend and other kidnapped children from terrible experiments by a mysterious organization.","Literary adaptations are always a testy business, with filmmakers consistently trying to appease fans of the original work while still making sufficient changes to make the material work as a film. With this in mind, as well as the inevitable uproar from various religious sects, The Golden Compass, adapted from the first book in Philip Pullman's 'His Dark Materials' trilogy was hardly an easy sell, and by no means a sure bid for box office success. Despite all of the negative factors against it, the film, while not the timeless fantasy epic it would like to be, proves a decent adaptation of Pullman's work and a sufficiently entertaining piece of escapism to boot.Despite initial skepticism, director Chris Weitz of American Pie infamy demonstrates sufficient care and interest in his subject matter to bring the novel to life in a suitably quality fashion. Despite the occasional moment of flashy cinematography or special effects giving the impression of a child experimenting with his film-making toys, Weitz demonstrates a firm and steady grip on his film, keeping the tone light for a younger audience while retaining the occasional darker moment from the book to keep fans satisfied. Weitz's screenplay, while nowhere near as disappointing as it could have been, falls prey to the typical film fantasy pitfall of consistently struggling to force-feed as much information to the audience as possible as quickly and in as simplistic a fashion as possible, leading to a somewhat rushed narrative and an irritating lack of character development or exposition. Fans of the source material will likely grumble due to the occasional creative change, some more noticeable than others, while those unfamiliar with Pullman's books may be lost in a flurry of confusion, bombarded with a constant array of new names, faces and theoretical concepts. However, despite a disappointingly simplistic tone, the sheer enjoyment factor of the novel is not lost, and such is the film's primary strength: entertainment, if at the cost of profundity.The special effects are for the most part top notch - the shapeshifting daemon effects are impressively integrated, the armoured bear fight is without question the pure, unfiltered exhilarating spectacle of the year, and the final mass battle sequence is similarly thrilling. The film's sets, costumes and props are spellbinding, easily giving the viewer the sense of being immersed in an imaginative alternate world with all of the visual splendour befitting such a fantasy epic. However, the film's musical score is a painful rehash of far too many clich√©d epic film scores of late - far too overdone to be in the least emotionally affecting.The stellar cast prove to be the film's high point, each inhabiting their roles with a comfort suggesting they had been born to play their respective parts. Newcomer Dakota Blue Richards is a revelation, surpassing the wooden efforts of most other child actors and carrying her lead role with ease, holding her own alongside her incredibly accomplished adult co-stars. Nicole Kidman is sheer perfection as the malevolent yet hypnotic Mrs. Coulter, effortlessly walking away with the show - every moment on screen, every glance, every movement is entirely in character, so fully does Kidman make the role her own. Daniel Craig proves a very fitting choice as scientific explorer Lord Asriel, making good use of his far too fleeting screen time, though one can't help but wish his character had a slight bit more of an edge to him.Sam Elliot gives his strongest performance in years, instilling sardonic aeronaut Lee Scoresby with an offbeat charisma and sly humour wonderfully fitting the role and Eva Green is an ethereal and captivating presence as mysterious witch Serafina Pekkala. The somberous tones of Ian McKellan prove ideal in breathing life and soul into armoured bear Iorek Byrnison, and young Freddie Highmore is well cast as the voice of Lyra's daemon, Pantalaimon. Derek Jacobi and Simon McBurney give strong, if one dimensional performances as heads of the ominous Magesterium organization, as does Christopher Lee, whose 'blink-and-you-miss- him' role appears to be nothing less than a blatant cash in on The Lord of the Rings, but who delivers his one line well at any rate.While fans of the novels may lament the watering down of the philosophical undertones of Pullman's novel, and the film being directed towards a younger audience, on the whole, despite the inescapable criticisms, as a sprawling piece of fantasy escapism, immersing the viewer in a world of armoured bears, daemons and witches, the film is a rousing success. It's just a shame to see such a strong premise fraught with such an overbearing air of caution and safety to please the lower common denominator, and one can't help but wish the producers had been slightly more daring, and captured a trace more of Pullman's nervy grit and spark to make the film a slightly less generic Hollywood blockbuster, and more satisfying overall. The film certainly isn't the 'next Lord of the Rings' which New Line certainly seems to intend for it to become, but an enjoyable and sufficiently impressive effort to warrant the next installment in the series, The Subtle Knife being made.-7.5/10"
Snow White and the Huntsman,2012,6.1,"In a twist to the fairy tale, the Huntsman ordered to take Snow White into the woods to be killed winds up becoming her protector and mentor in a quest to vanquish the Evil Queen.","Based on the German fairy tale Snow White, 'Snow White and the Huntsman' is A Visual Masterstroke, that comes across a delight to the eyes. And even in terms of story-telling, this dark adaptation gets it right.'Snow White and the Huntsman' Synopsis: In a twist to the fairy tale, the Huntsman ordered to take Snow White into the woods to be killed winds up becoming her protector and mentor in a quest to vanquish the Evil Queen.'Snow White and the Huntsman' is gorgeous to look at. Each Frame looks magical thanks to the magnificent Cinematography by Greig Fraser & The Fantastic Graphics, that compliment the film.Evan Daugherty, John Lee Hancock & Hossein Amini's Screenplay gives a twist in the tale of Snow White, making it dark & violent, but that works on its advantage, as its refreshing. Rupert Sanders Directs this fantasy-adventure superbly. His execution, in terms of visuals, is ovation worthy. Costume & Art Design are flawless.Performance-Wise: Kristen Stewart as Snow White, delivers a sincere performance. Charlize Theron as Queen Ravenna, is purely evil. Chris Hemsworth as Eric the Huntsman, is fantastic. Ian McShane as Beith, Bob Hoskins as Muir, Johnny Harris as Quert, Toby Jones as Coll, Eddie Marsan as Duir, Ray Winstone as Gort & Brian Gleeson as Gus, are lovable as The Dwarfs.On the whole, 'Snow White and the Huntsman' is a certainly a story worth watching."
Killer Elite,2011,6.4,"When his mentor is taken captive by a disgraced Arab sheik, a killer-for-hire is forced into action. His mission: kill three members of Britain's elite Special Air Service responsible for his son's deaths.","Danny Bryce is a retired mercenary but he is forced to return to work when his mentor, Hunter, is taken captive by an employer after failing to complete a mission. Bryce is told he must finish the job if Hunter is to live. The employer is an Omani Sheikh whose three eldest sons were killed during a war; he wants the Danny to kill the three men responsible... it won't be easy though; they were all members of the Special Air Service. Each man must confess then the death must look like an accident. He, and a small team of associates go after the targets but it quickly becomes apparent that somebody, former SAS officer Spike Logan, knows what they are up to.This is a decent enough story but it would have been better if it didn't claim to be true. It starts well with a prologue that serves to introduce Danny and Hunter and explain why Danny has retired. The way that he is pulled back into that world is effective enough. Once the action starts it is solid and nicely captures the feel of the early eighties. Jason Statham is solid as Bryce and Clive Owen is equally solid as Logan; although both have been better elsewhere. Robert De Niro is decent enough as Hunter although he is rather old to be playing a mercenary. The story provides plenty of twists and turns, some rather far-fetched. Overall I thought it passed the time nicely; not a must see but still entertaining."
The Bourne Supremacy,2004,7.7,"When Jason Bourne is framed for a CIA operation gone awry, he is forced to resume his former life as a trained assassin to survive.","Oh man, I say The Bourne Supremacy is much more thrilling than the first one. The first one was like an introduction of Bourne and now since we know the character, it is left with solid story and thrilled feeling after watching.The story follows after the first installation; Bourne fight back after being framed by the Russian mob and now the CIA is after him.What can I say; this is better than Bond series, with all the actions, sophisticated car chase scenes, the cat and mouse chase and the tactic between the killing machine and the world biggest organization. The soundtrack is also great.This is brilliant movie, somewhat surpass my expectation. I thought it is like a B grade but this is definitely an A.Recommended.Rating: 8/10 (Grade: A-)"
Gone in 60 Seconds,2000,6.5,"To save his brother, ex-thief Memphis must steal 50 luxury cars in 3 days for a crime boss. He reunites his old crew, including his mentor Otto and ex-girlfriend Sway, while police track them.","What's in a name? If the name is Jerry Bruckheimer expect it to be filled with action.In producer Bruckheimer's latest film, Gone in 60 Seconds, its all about the nomenclature.  With character monikers like Kip, Sway and The Sphinx and cars idealized with names like Diane, Sue and the elusive Eleanor, it's only the non-stop action that keeps you from wanting to just play the name game.Not a deep script by any means, but it is a great vehicle for action as Nicolas Cage as Memphis Raines, along with Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall, comes out of car-thievery retirement to save his brother's life by stealing a list of 50 exotic cars in one night.  A remake of the 1974 cult hit, this film may not be destined for the same cult status but it is entertaining.Surprisingly, it's the action that keeps you watching not the acting. Although loaded with stars, none of them have standout performances, including a very weak performance by one of my favorite up and comers, Giovanni Ribisi.  Even Jolie, coming off her recent Oscar win, is just a token love interest with hardly any screen time.Can a series of beautiful cars and the car chases they become involved in make a great film?  I think so.  The film is a pleasure to look at and although one particular scene takes you into the realm of unbelieveablity, the action is non-stop and the suspense is compelling.  Just be wary of other drivers fighting for a pole position as you leave the theatre.3 1/2 out of 5"
Alice in Wonderland,2010,6.4,"Nineteen-year-old Alice returns to the magical world from her childhood adventure, where she reunites with her old friends and learns of her true destiny: to end the Red Queen's reign of terror.","Disney presents Tim Burton's Alice in WonderlandSTARRINGJohnny Depp... as Willy Wonka, if Willy Wonka hadn't been Michael JacksonMia Wasikowska... as a winsome young lady Alice who discovers her inner fortitudeCrispin Glover... who doesn't dance, unfortunatelyHelena Bonham-Carter... with a big headMatt Lucas... as two Matt LucasesStephen Fry... who does actual voice acting and doesn't just read his linesPaul Whitehouse... who against all my expectations, still does know how to be very funnyAlan Rickman... who nearly steals the movie, just by doing what he does bestChristopher Lee... who actually steals the movie with just two linesANDBabs Mitchell-Windsor... playing a character her actual, real sizeI can see why the they've not really wanted to call the film a proper sequel. It is that, being the story of a nineteen year old Alice who returns to barely-remembered Wonderland, but it also lifts dialogue and scenes from the original books. The story is your standard journey, emotionally, but all set in a very Tim Burton Wonderland.Which, of course, looks astounding. Wonderland is an amazing place, often colourful, but equally often ravaged and desolate. It's a treat for the eyes, with the imagination and design shining through the technology. (It's very, very good, but strange things happen if you look somewhere the 3D doesn't want you to look and there's the odd moment of strangely stiff animation, especially when human(-like) characters are completely CGI-ed up.)Unexpectedly, it sometimes feels like one of the Narnia films (though makes those movies look like accountant-led spreadsheets that have been printed out on toilet paper and left out in the rain), but mainly it's exactly what you'd expect from Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. It's a great big treat of a movie, to be sure. Given that it's Tim Burton working with Disney, it's often gruesome and scary, but not too much. It makes you laugh at times, it pins you to the back of your seat at others, it gets you leaning forward trying to drink in every detail of the place, but it's not ever actually surprising. You know what's up, you know where things are going and you're never shocked. (Maybe once, in a quiet, horrible scene that stands out, even amongst the rest.) Even if you've not seen a single still photo or second of footage, if you know Wonderland and you know Tim Burton, you can picture it yourself effortlessly.So much of it is still in my head this morning, but it's all visual. There's no heartache or sense of triumph that lingers after a great story. Funny as it is, there's only one line I'm ever likely to quote (a single word). I just have these amazing images left in my brain. In that sense, then, it's appropriately dream-like.I doubt I'll go back and watch it again at the cinema, but I'm most definitely getting the Blu- Ray when it comes out next week, or whenever Disney decided they should bring it out.If it feels like I've damned it with faint praise, I don't intend to. It's all pretty wonderful for the two hours it takes to speed past you, but I just want to make it clear - nothing that goes into your ears or your heart ever quite matches what goes into your eyes."
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,2003,6.5,"An advertising executive and ladies' man, to win a big campaign, bets that he can make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days.","So its fluffy and predictable. It's unrealistic and sickly sweet. Who cares...this film pretends to be nothing more than what it is intended to be. Light romantic comedy.Since stars like Cary Grant, Kathrine Hepburn and Irene Dunne, lit up our cinema screens in the 1930's with films like The Awful Truth, Bringing up Baby and My Favorite Wife, Hollywood and of course the movie going public have reserved a special place in their hearts for RomComs, screwballs and battle of the sexes comedies.Identical plots, Identical jokes but none the less jokes and plots that will never go out of style and will always be relevant in any age or location, whether it be New York of the 30's or New York in the present day.Hollywood has always worked on the basis that they stick to what has been tried and tested and has proved to work, that is why with a small plot change and a rehash of old jokes and situations they are able to reinvent their movies for a new generation of film buffs. It was through this formula that Doris Day and friends were able to continue RomCom history throughout the 60's and every one of them box office winners.A recent example of this would be Down With Love starring Ewan McGregor and Rene Zelwegger. Who could not see plot comparisons to Pillow Talk or Lover Come Back? Yet it did not make this film any less enjoyable. Our entertainment lies in seeing our actors of the day fill the roles of the great actors of yesterday and how the scripts and jokes are adapted and told within a backdrop of 21st century life etc.Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson made this film with impeccable comic timing and enjoyable performances. Of course with Goldie Hawn for a mother, Hudson comes straight from comic stock so I would have been disappointed if she failed to meet the challenge but she didn't. Some of her facial expressions and mannerisms almost had me convinced I was watching an old episode of ""Laugh In""McConaughey also held his own and proved himself to be a gifted comic as he did in the Wedding Planner.This plot seemed quite original and as a battle of the sexes comedy, they seldom come as good as this. Again the formula was followed and we were under no illusion on what the final outcome would be, but their journey to this ultimate destination is what we find entertaining.This type of film has been popular for seventy plus years and their simularities are what makes them so. Instead of slamming them..watch some of the predecessors and appreciate their origins.Be thankful they are still making these types of movies today as in an era which is threatening to be devoured by action thrillers, fantasy adventure and shoot 'em ups this seems to be the only diversity left in motion pictures."
Ice Age,2002,7.5,"Manny the mammoth, Sid the loquacious sloth, and Diego the sabre-toothed tiger go on a comical quest to return a human baby back to his father, across a world on the brink of an ice age.","This was great. I liked it better than I did Shrek, by far. 'Manfred' and the Squirrel really take the cake here-excellant voice work, nice animation of the character faces, Denis Leary was a hoot too....with just the right amount of an edge, as is usual for him.Some of the vignettes-the Dodos, (You've got three melons), etc are right up there with anything Pixar has done. I also thought that the little montage of Mannfred's parent's(cave drawings come to life) were done well too.As for the messages-'Non-trad families are okay too-', people can work together, etc.-well, all are pretty obvious and all that-but it's not hammered home ala Disney, and you also don't have anyone breaking out into song, either.See it for the Mammoth and the squirrel, though the Sloth is fun too. Cute kid baby too, not far removed from 'Boo' in Monsters Inc.*** outta ****"
Contact,1997,7.5,"Dr. Ellie Arroway, after years of searching, finds conclusive radio proof of extraterrestrial intelligence, sending plans for a mysterious machine.","This remains true for this very good adaptation of the classic book by Carl Sagan. Sagans' idea was to make science and the elite commandeering of information available to the majority, he wrote his books for a wide audience and I think the film shows this as was intended by its author.The Film is roughly about Dr Arroway, Ellie, and how she handles being alone in a world without family or close friends. It is metaphorically able to make us all think about how isolated we as a race, and as people can feel.Ellie, a brilliant young scientist working on the mistrusted SETI program discovers a message sent to earth from distant star system Vega. On its discovery Ellie must battle with the Military, Pentagon, and Male Dominated scientific world to keep her cards on the table and her discovery that of her team. Ellie is constantly kept in the game by he benefactor, a rich technological industrialist mogul who has a vested interest in her participation of the programme to reach this alien culture.I don't wish to go on any further and spoil this movie as I rate it as a fantastic exploration of Science Vs Religion and the entire subsequent human spectrum in between. As a film there were several alterations from the book that I felt could have been included, for example not just one traveler but a range of them, philosophers, theologists, scientists, poets and Dr Arroway.I have watched this film a number of times and still find it a joy to watch the fifth, eighth and tenth time. Jody foster playing a not so dissimilar to her role in Silence of the lambs (attractive, clever, young, successful woman battling in a male world) is exceptional and delivers feeling and intellect alongside an impressive script.I would give this film an 8.5 and recommend it to anybody, but if you are a sci-fi fan and haven't seen this film then you're in for a treat."
Blue Streak,1999,6.4,A former convict poses as a cop to retrieve a diamond he stole years ago.,"Jewel thief Miles Logan and his gang are stealing a large diamond in LA. After the robbery Logan is double crossed by another thief, Deacon, but gets away when the police arrive.  He stashed the diamond but is sent to jail. When he is released he returns to where he hid the diamond to find it is  a police station.  He pretends to be a cop to get access but he is partnered with rookie Carlson and sent out to do jobs.  However Deacon is also searching for the diamond and Logan must also take care of him as he tries to find the jewel and solve crimes.I gotta admit that I hate Lawrence ¬ñ his comedies are always sitcom level and he is like a sub-par Eddie Murphy.  Sadly I still find his clowning funny!  I can't explain it.  Here the plot is no more than an excuse for many funny scenes with all the action brought together in a `dramatic' climax!  However it is funny ¬ñ even if it's very straightforward.  I imagine that if you hat Lawrence then you'll hate this but if you're in the mood for a simple no-brain comedy then you can rely on Lawrence to deliver just that.He actually quite good here ¬ñ even if he's the same in every film he does the same shtick. It's also good to see Luke Wilson in it ¬ñ even if he's got a role that is really beneath his talents, although Greene is good. Really it's Lawrence's show and he does well but if you hate him then you'll hate this no matter what.Overall if you want a silly no-brain comedy then this is worth a shot, but if Lawrence annoys you then don't even bother."
In de klauwen van de draak,1973,7.6,A Shaolin martial artist travels to an island fortress to spy on an opium lord - who is also a former monk from his temple - under the guise of attending a fighting tournament.,"'Enter The Dragon' was a massive part of my childhood back in the 1970s. As a pre-teen Bruce Lee was just about the coolest thing I'd ever seen. Maybe only Bond (Sean Connery Bond!) and Charlton Heston as 'The Omega Man' came close. Like 'The Omega Man' this movie is one that I find difficult to be objective about. The plot is simplistic, the acting is variable, but the action and the LOOK of it make it an all time classic. Let's face it this is a kung fu movie, and what the audience wants is exciting fight scenes. 'Enter The Dragon' has them and then some! I'm not sure whether I'd describe it as ""the greatest martial arts movie ever made"" (as many people do), but it's certainly one of the most entertaining I've ever seen. The only other one I've seen that comes close is 'Iron Monkey', but as good as it was, it obviously didn't have the one thing that makes this movie legendary - Bruce Lee. Lee is without a doubt the greatest ku fu fighter to step in front of a movie camera. Handsome and charismatic, this movie was to be his introduction to mainstream Hollywood audiences. He died unexpectedly just weeks before it premiered in America. It seems certain that he would have become a superstar, bigger than Jackie Chan (who incidentally has a brief cameo here) is today. Whenever Lee is on the screen you can't take your eyes off him - he's that good. You don't need any other reason to watch this movie than Bruce Lee, but having John Saxon ('Planet Of Blood', 'Tenebrae') co-star is an added treat, and Jim Kelly is super cool. After the enormous success of 'Enter The Dragon' director Robert Clouse made 'Black Belt Jones' with him, another 70s kung fu classic, but Kelly never really fulfilled his potential, and instead made cheesy but fun b-grade vehicles like 'Black Samurai' and 'Black Belt Jones 2'. I also love Han, the tongue-in-cheek 'Dr No' inspired villain played by Kien Shih. 'Enter The Dragon' is essential viewing for all 1970s buffs. It had a major impact on pop culture and it's still great wonderful to watch thirty years after it was originally released. To say I highly recommend this movie is an understatement!"
Bedazzled,2000,6.1,"Hopeless dweeb Elliot Richards is granted seven wishes by the Devil to snare Allison, the girl of his dreams, in exchange for his soul.","The 1967 original, starring Dudley Moor and Peter Cook and directed by Stanley Donen was a droll dark comedy that bombed when it was first released to theatres but has developed a very strong cult following over the years. This 2000 version, directed by Harold Ramis is not so much a remake as a latter-day re-imagining of the story.  Aside from the basic premise, the two films share little else in common.  This new version is a wacky, fast-paced farce that makes up in some giddily amusing moments what it lacks in true wickedness.Brendan Fraser is perfectly cast as the hapless computer tech who makes a deal with Satan; granted seven wishes in exchange for eventual possession of his soul, we witness each wish he makes as his life becomes a series of colorful and very funny misadventures.  Some first-rate make-up and special effects transform Fraser and his world every time he changes wishes. Elizabeth Hurley is extremely fetching and quite likable as the embodiment of Satan, although I wish she'd showed a bit more evilness than glee in her characterization.All in all, a very entertaining movie that, of course, leaves the door open for a sequel.  Bring it on!"
Moneyball,2011,7.6,Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane's successful attempt to assemble a baseball team on a lean budget by employing computer-generated analysis to acquire new players.,"I have another rare chance to catch a film more than a day before its national release. Usually when this happens there's a horde of folks queued up. When the doors to the theatre open, phones are sequestered, and a rush is put on to find prime seating. Those were movies starring a bunch of¬Ö well less than household names. Surely a sneak to see a Brad Pitt movie would be even more chaotic. Unfortunately the waning popularity of America's pastime is as much of a deterrent as a movie star and free entertainment are agents of attraction.Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) is a former major leaguer turned general manager of the Oakland A's. After losing in the playoffs to the Yankees, the A's lose their stars to free agency. Billy is tasked with rebuilding despite a payroll that leaves the A's trailing the competition.While going through the usual motions, Billy happens by Pete Brand (Jonah Hill), an economist who may have found a way to scout baseball with the efficiency the A's need. The two delve in head first, and despite some tough outings they never back down.Pitt is at the top of his game. As an everyman‚Äîor at least one that isn't played up as wealthy, a man struggling to keep his job‚Äîfrustration is clearly seen in Pitt's face. Pitt brings humanity to the ominous job of a general manager. Flashbacks of his stint in ""the show"" surmise his entire life, be it his divorce or relationship with his daughter Casey (Kerris Dorsey).Moneyball is not the action-packed sports outing one may be expecting. Director Bennett Miller spends very little time focusing on the game of baseball, or even the personalities of the players. Moneyball is a movie about management. Its deadpan, forthright approach is fresh compared to the typical underdog story filled with home runs and stolen bases. There's no electrifying music or thrilling speeches, but the excitement found in a phone call is realized as well as one could imagine. I don't think any actor other than Hill could pull of his slowly clinched fist.Like the good sports films, Moneyball shares a deeper meaning than simply winning. Immediately the value of loyalty comes to mind. The sports genre is changing, much like how the crew of this story changed talent scouting. Just last year a movie rose up about the struggle to manage a boxer, and now here's the struggle to manage a team."
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,2007,7.5,"With their warning about Lord Voldemort's return scoffed at, Harry and Dumbledore are targeted by the Wizard authorities as an authoritarian bureaucrat slowly seizes power at Hogwarts.","Within the first 5 minutes you can tell the series has undergone a dramatic tone shift and I have to say I think thats appropriate since Voldemorts return at the end of Goblet of Fire means that it's time to put aside childish things. The big bad men are here and they don't care about hurting children. it's time to get nasty.Gone is the frivolity of the first couple of movies where magic was cool and everything in this new and magical world was just wonderful to behold, a la World of Disney. The new director has taken some risks with style and approach and they've paid off brilliantly. Order of the Phoenix is probably the darkest of the five movies we've had so far, even more so than Azkhaban which was a step in the right direction for where the series would eventually be heading. There's very little ""fun"" in Phoenix and you can see why. The Dark Lord is back, it's no laughing matter and this movie actually sells that fact.This (in the movie world at least) is where Harry Potter crosses the line from kids movie to grown ups movie.Harry now has some serious mental scars (as well as his actual one of course) since the events of the previous movie which while lighter than Azkhaban, followed on well from that movie. The Ministry of Magic is in denial about Voldermorts return and are trying to control the flow of rumour stemming from the events of Goblet. To this end we have new teacher and Ministry stooge Dolores Umbridge. Pink and fluffy on the outside, crunchy and evil on the inside. She makes no qualms about re-ordering the law at Hogwarts putting the kybosh on anything even remotely fun and making the students lives a complete misery. What she put Harry through in detention was simply pure evil.She wasn't quite how I pictured her from the book but Imelda Staunton played her with a deliciously bitter/sweet twist, all charming and proper in her righteous delusions with that ""stab you in the back"" thing going on. She was a nasty piece of work.It is a shame that a lot of the content of the book was missing but it was a big book and although I can't put my finger on what wasn't in the movie (I read it a while ago now) it does sometimes feel that there should have more substance to a few areas, mainly the characterisation of some of the characters. Most of the major bits I remember from the book were in the movie. There's a pace here we haven't seen before, a new musical approach also puts a new twist on things and I think Harry Potters world seems to fit it's new clothes well. I'm eagerly anticipating what's next as I hear David Yates is also directing the Half Blood Prince (last I heard anyway) and since that book has zombies in it I think the new dark style will suit it awesomely thank you very much.The characters all look much older than they're supposed to be in Phoenix but it also kind of works in it's favour. They all look like they have a bit more history and life experience behind them, they're coping with stuff that will age any kid and it shows. That's also testament to the acting as well. Here mostly all the acting is pretty good, Ron Harry and Hermione all put in good efforts obviously having gotten the hang of the whole acting lark. Gambon is good as Dumbledore but I do miss Richard Harris and keep playing what might have been his versions of Gambons scenes over in my head. When I read the books it's Harris I'm picturing. Helena Bonham Carter gives a kooky insane kind of air to Bellatrix Lestrange (must get that from hubby Tim Burton) who was a pretty good character. One thing about this film though is that the actual Order of the Phoenix isn't in it all that much really. A flaw that wasn't in the book. The line about Snape being in the order, if you missed it you wouldn't even know he was in the order at all and a subsequent scene later on might seem confusing.Kreacher was well done I though, coming across as a real miserable old bugger which was appropriate. The producers apparently weren't going to put him in the movie at all but JK Rowling said they'd be stuffing themselves up for the final movie if they did that.All in all I think Phoenix is the best so far of the five movies, followed by Azkhaban, Goblet, then the other two in no particular order.Now I've just got hold of The Deathly Hallows and although it's quarter past five I'm off to bed so see you later...."
Robin Hood: Men in Tights,1993,6.7,"A spoof of Robin Hood in general, and Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991) in particular.","I remember when I first saw this movie. I was babysitting for a friend of my mums, and one of the kids suggested we watch it. Thinking it was the frankly laughable 'Prince of Thieves' they were slipping into the video recorder, I was prepared for a few hours of boredom, What I got came as a shock, a pleasant one I'll admit, but still a shock.Now, you all know the Robin Hood legend don't you? I shall explain a little. Robin Hood was a Saxon criminal, nicking money here and there and giving it to people who needed it, all the while seducing the beautiful Maid Marion, and vexing the Sheriff of Nottingham and prince john. That's the basics! Now, on with the review.This movie was released in 1993, and is a take off of the whole Robin Hood legend and a p--- take of Prince of Thieves in particular.Loosely following the legend, Robin of Loxley is first encountered in an Arabic prison during the third century crusades, and together with a 'Moor' as they were called in those days, he executes a cunning escape with a cellmate, Asneeze.After escaping, Asneeze beseeches Robin to find his son Atchoo, a foreign exchange student in England and look out for him. This Robin vows to do! Robin swims back to England.He returns to his home, Loxley castle to find it being wheeled away on the back of the cart by Bailiffs, and goes through he sorrowful revelation that his father, dog, cat, and even the goldfish are all dead. Desperate for a familiar face, he finds the family's loyal blind servant Blinkin sitting on the toilet with a Jazz mag in Braille. The hilarity continues throughout the movie.As with all Robin Hood stories, Robin must thwart the evil plans of Prince John and the sheriff of Rottingham, who are wreaking havoc and charging exorbitant taxes on King Richards's kingdom while he's away.Those familiar with the movies Mel Brooks has previously directed will have some small idea of what to expect. After all, this is the man responsible for Dracula-dead and loving it and young Frankenstein. All the jokes, which range from visual gags to wonderful witty comments are in exactly the right places throughout the movie, with never more than a minute between laughs.Cary Elwes (incidentally the only English man to play Robin Hood in a movie), who many of you will know from Princess Bride brings his cheeky grinning twinkle eyed presence to this movie, and does a wonderful job. From outlandish heroic posturing, to a wickedly sexy glance, he really is amazingly funny. And the man looks better in tights than I do!Richard Lewis is hilarious as the whiny, arrogant Prince John with the ever-changing mole. He gets the sissy-boy behaviour down to a tee, and his whinging American vocalisations are great. All the way through the movie, a mole on his face constantly changes position: it starts on his left cheek, then over to his right cheek, then his chin, then his forehead, before going back to it's original place. This is a subtle joke based on the mole on Alan Rickman when he played the sheriff in Prince Of ThievesRoger Rees as the sleazy sheriff of Rottingham is marvellously slimy and nasty, and has some great lines throughout the film.There are some faces here you'll be familiar with from other Brooks films. For instance Robert Ridgely, playing the hangman in this film also played the hangman in Blazing Saddles, another film directed by Brooks. He likes to add subtle references to his earlier films too; with several in this film that die-hard Brooks fans will easily spot. Those who watched History of the World part 1 will recognise the music to the song 'Men in Tights'. Also, when Patrick Stewart arrives and snogs Marion, Mel himself (playing Rabbi Tuckman) utters the line 'it's good to be a king', one of his lines in History of the world.The whole cast is wonderfully comedic, even those with only a few lines bring a great depth of warmth and humour to themWhat makes this film so wonderfully warm and funny in my own opinion are all the improvised scenes. Although there was a script of sorts, some scenes were completely improvised by the actors themselves, such as the scene where Latrine (Tracey Ullman) prays for Rottingham in her bed, and he falls through the ceiling, landing right where she wanted him, which was totally devised and thought out by the two actors.There are few special effects, and those that are there are small but fun moments of computerised camera trickery.The soundtrack is memorable, with some very funny songs, and a couple of cheesy love songs. You'll be singing 'Men in tights' or at least humming it to yourself, for weeks.The rating is Pg, to which I say BAH HUMBUG. There is no bad language in the film, except in the use of double entendre, and one utterance of sh!t, and violence is minimal. In fact I'd go as far as to say non-existent, apart from a few comedy fight scenes.A great fun film that adults and children alike will enjoy!"
Wall Street,1987,7.3,"An impatient young stockbroker is willing to do anything to get to the top, including trading on illegal inside information taken through a ruthless, greedy corporate raider who takes the youth under his wing.","(The speech about the 1% is more important than the greed speech.)
""It's not a question of enough, pal. It's a Zero Sum game - somebody wins, somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply, transferred - from one perception to another. Like magic.""
If you made a list of best New York movies, it would probably be blasphemous not to include work from Woody Allen or Martin Scorsese. However, for me, this might be the ultimate movie set in the financial capital of the world.
I guess this is obvious, but it's hard to replicate the chemistry that a real father and son have. Martin and Charlie Sheen are near perfect together in every scene.
Michael Douglas reaches god-mode as Gordon Gekko. Maybe my favorite performances of the 1980s?
The most famous cellphone in the history of movies? If you want to have some fun, do a bit of research on the gigantic cellular device.
The mash-up of everyone buying/selling stock on Wall-Street is pure ecstasy. Inject it straight into my veins!
The screenplay is perfect. So smart. As an economics teacher, I'm probably biased, but I'm hooked on every word! A masterpiece!"
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,1992,6.9,"Kevin is separated from his family again when he accidentally boards a flight to New York City during a Christmas trip to Miami. However he crosses paths with the same burglars, who now plan to rob a toy store on Christmas eve.","""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" is young Macaulay Culkin's second greatest hour in the series as Kevin McCallister, who has to learn to be a man again on the mean streets of the Big Apple after being separated from his family once more. He checks into a swank Manhattan hotel (where Donald Trump is apparently staying at too). He's pursued again by comic bad guys Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern), and director Chris Columbus and screenwriter John Hughes keep the action and laughs coming. Tim Curry also appears as a concierge who has to prove that Kevin is on his own, and Brenda Fricker is the pigeon lady who watches over Kevin's little shoulder. There is another tricks & traps showdown at the end, which keeps the slapstick and comic violence at an all-time high.8/10"
Big Daddy,1999,6.4,"A lazy law school graduate adopts a kid to impress his girlfriend, but everything doesn't go as planned.","Some movies are made for us to ponder questions of morality and ethics. Some are made for us to question reality.  Some are made for us to find ourselves.This movie is not one of them.This movie was made for one reason and that is to make us laugh.  And it does that very well.Sandler plays an incredibly irresponsible derelict that has no real job or ambition in life.  He gets a kid left on is doorstep and he is forced to care for him.  The story needn't be described any more than that, we all know what happens.  But it is what this movie does to our senses that makes it worth while.  In short, it makes us laugh hysterically.  This film is a whirlwind of jokes and hilarity and when it stops to let you catch your breath it still entertains you.  I admire films like this.  They aren't meant to be Instinct or The Siege ( two films that I absolutely love ) but all it aspires to do is entertain you; take you away from life for 90 minutes.  And let's face it.  Sitting in a cool theater with a bag of M&M's, a cold Coke and a funny movie is a perfect way to spend a lazy summer afternoon.This is a great movie and it will make you laugh.  That's all it is, nothing more, nothing less.  And we should be thankful for that."
Serendipity,2001,6.8,"A couple search for each other years after the night they first met, fell in love, and separated, convinced that one day they'd end up together.","Sarah is a girl who believes obsessively in destiny. So, according to her, if two people are meant to be together they'll be; the fate would decide the time though. Until then, they've to be content with signals that will remind them of their soulmates. Two perfect strangers bump into each other on a Christmas evening while shopping for gloves. Jonathan feels instant spark, but Sarah is not so sure. She would rather wait for an appropriate time. For now, they would spend a wonderful evening together. At the end of that, Jonathan gets to know her first name. Years pass by; they are about to get married to two different persons. But, hardly there have been a day when didn't think of each other. What they do now? It's a passionately romantic movie. Not too much drama like Titanic. It has the flavor 'Sweet November'. The comedy is kept to minimum. John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale have played their parts convincingly. Beckinsale is adorable, and Cusack has some bohemian charm. His disheveled look sometime contradicts his Romeo-like role. But it contributes positively to his constant confusedness. The ending is so predictable. Only that it may not happen when you think. Peter Chelsom deserves applaud for making a beautiful film, even though when you know what would happen next."
Tropic Thunder,2008,7.1,"Through a series of freak occurrences, a group of actors shooting a big-budget war movie are forced to become the soldiers they are portraying.","This is hands down Ben Stiller's best movie. It has great action, great dialogue, great acting, great music and great humor. This movie is filled with quotable lines and works very well. The performances I have to single out for praise are Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr, Jay Baruchel, Matthew McConaughey, and Tom Cruise. I feel like this movie approaches it's themes in a way similar to Blazing Saddles but Blazing Saddles has a lot more slapstick. The Tugg Speedman character is not as memorable as Derek Zoolander but this movie is far better than Zoolander is. This is my favorite Ben Stiller movie alongside Meet The Fockers, Zoolander, Starsky and Hutch, and Night At The Museum 1 and 3 but I still haven't seen There's Something About Mary. I honestly prefer Robert Downey Jr as Kirk Lazuras over him as Iron Man but they are both fantastic performances. Tom Cruise is awesome as Less Grossman. He owns his character that is very different from everything else he has done. I hope Ben Stiller is proud of this movie because to me this is his best one."
Million Dollar Baby,2004,8.1,"Frankie, an ill-tempered old coach, reluctantly agrees to train aspiring boxer Maggie. Impressed with her determination and talent, he helps her become the best and the two soon form a close bond.","Reviewers say 'Million Dollar Baby' is acclaimed for Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman's performances, and its exploration of determination, courage, and relationships. The film is lauded for emotional depth and character development. However, it faces criticism for its controversial ending, perceived as manipulative or rushed. Some reviewers find clich√©s, melodrama, and unrealistic boxing scenes. Despite these critiques, many still view it as impactful and worthwhile."
Training Day,2001,7.8,A rookie cop spends his first day as a Los Angeles narcotics officer with a rogue detective who isn't what he appears to be.,"If you ask me, TRAINING DAY is an excellent film that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat and blow you away. Harris (Denzel Washington) kind of gave me the creeps. You'll understand why once you've seen this movie. In my opinion, the performances were top grade, the direction was superior, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the cast was perfectly chosen. Also, the soundtrack is really good, too. Before I wrap this up, I must warn you that this movie is very violent if you're going to see it, so viewer discretion is strongly advised. Now, in conclusion, if you're a fan of Denzel Washington or Ethan Hawke, I highly recommend this movie. It's sure to keep you guessing from start to finish."
About Time,2013,7.8,"At the age of 21, Tim discovers he can travel in time and change what happens and has happened in his own life. His decision to make his world a better place by getting a girlfriend turns out not to be as easy as you might think.","I attended a preview screening of this in London.If you enjoy previous Richard Curtis (writer, director) films such as Four Weddings and a funeral, Notting Hill and Love Actually then you will very likely enjoy this sweet time travel comedy drama albeit with an ironic sense of time travel feeling of been having been here before.But that more of the same feeling is no bad thing, thanks largely to the wonderful performances of the cast and more importantly, the exquisite execution of its new spin, the time travelling plot device. In fact, the time travelling here is really good fun and plentiful as its employed with typical motives but with inventiveness by our main protagonist, a stereotypical ""loser"" played with utter charm and goofiness by Domhall Gleeson. His use of the power is at times hilarious but very useful without your typical ""changing your past will backfire"" moral message. In most time travel movies, changing events in the past is usually painted as a negative repercussion but here, for the most part, the movie is certainly promoting its benefits.The time travel premise have some set rules that nicely serves the narrative, although if you think too carefully in some scenes, you might find some minute flaws in the execution of the cause and effects which could have been made neater if extra attention was paid.There is a moral message but you have to wait until the end to get what it is because it isn't so obvious as the film rolls. You might suspect things will happen in some ways as you watch the film but they don't and you might wonder, what's the story then but let it roll and the point of it all comes at the end.However, that waiting for the end leads to my first little bit of criticism. This film clocks in at just over 2hours and it did feel a tad too long. There are quite a few points in the film which I feel could have been trimmed. I think it could have been about at least 10 minutes shorter.There are familiar stalwart faces from Richard Curtis's previous films making guest appearances with the always awesome Bill Nighy justifiably anchoring a supporting role with his usual high calibre presence. Its also nice to see one of our great British character actors who had recently passed away make a surprise and funny bit part appearance perhaps for the last time...or did the film makers travel back in time to shoot his part? Rachel McAdams is very lovely as the love interest and is believable as a girl worth manipulating time for.I'm not a great fan of Richard Curtis previous movies but this film swims along with so much charm, English middle class idiosyncrasies, a lovely romance and a gentle pacing that flows with a steady beat from beginning to end. This is not a riotous comedy, its not a thriller, nor an adventure or even a film that draws any suspense towards the last act. Its a journey through a period of our time traveller's life, sometimes funny, charming, poignant with a very clever and enjoyable time travelling premise.Its certainly a great date movie too.8/10"
The Blue Lagoon,1980,5.8,"During the Victorian period, two preteen cousins are shipwrecked on a tropical island in the South Pacific and enjoy a simple life together until puberty complicates matters.","I have always liked this film, and don't like it when it is criticized so much. Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins did a wonderful job, they were excellent. Brooke is a beautiful, talented actress. The scenery was just gorgeous, it makes you want to fly off to Fiji where they filmed most of the movie to see what it is really like. The music is also very good. The story starts out with a ship which catches fire, and everyone is forced to abandon ship. Two young children, Richard and Emmeline, as well as a drunken cook named Paddy, get on a lifeboat together and drift on the sea for many days, until they discover land, a bunch of little remote tropical islands. They build a home there. Time passes, and Paddy passes away, but Richard and Emmeline continue growing up together. They get older, and new feelings come over them. They discover many things about adolescence and sex. This is a great love story, sweet and lovable. Brooke and Chris make a great onscreen couple. The sex/nudity scenes are not really that bad at all, they're rather mild. There is more nudity in the underwater swimming sequences, but mostly all of that was done by Brooke's stand-in, a professional diver. I really like this movie, and even though there are a few logic loopholes, it is still enjoyable. My only complaint: I think this film could've gone on for about 5 more mins. or so and explained things a little bit better."
The Invasion,2007,5.9,"As a Washington, D.C. psychiatrist unearths the origin of an alien epidemic, she also discovers her son might be the only way it can be stopped.","By now you know the obvious, that this is a failed remake of a remarkable film.You can read from others about the cinematic properties it lacks, the imprecision, the failed pace, lack of urgent focus... Its really bad. Films like this are their own sort of virus.What I'd like to remark on is the lack of subtext. I'm not sure one needs such a thing in horror films of this conspiracy-invasion kind. But the original had it and it gave it great power. The context was the cold war and the suspicion that there were silent, secret sleeper cells. That what this (the cold war) was all about was some grand battle between good and evil, but that evil often had persuasion on its side. The ""convinced"" were effectively brainwashed and thus behaved like zombies.We use things like this today. I saw a zombie movie (the one with the shopping mall) that clearly conflated Muslim extremists with the zombies, and the recent ""Cloverfield"" deliberately evoked 9-11.I'm not sure how one would convey that today with this film and stick close to the original idea. This business of ""don't go to sleep."" The notion that ADD kids are the salvation of society, somehow the root of what it means to be American. The subtext that psychiatrists matter. The idea that a lowly technician in a local hospital could mobilize and lead a worldwide response. The massive amount of explanation we suffer, particularly at the end.Kidman has had better days. It has a troubled production history with rewrites and massive reshoots. It shows.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."
X-Men,2000,7.3,"In a world where mutants (evolved super-powered humans) exist and are discriminated against, two groups form for an inevitable clash: the supremacist Brotherhood, and the pacifist X-Men.","Reviewers say 'X-Men' is lauded for introducing iconic characters, strong performances, and tackling themes of discrimination and identity. Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and Ian McKellen's Magneto receive particular acclaim. However, the film faces criticism for outdated special effects, underdeveloped characters, and a perceived shallow plot. Pacing issues and certain character choices are also noted. Despite these drawbacks, 'X-Men' is recognized for revitalizing the comic book genre and establishing a standard for subsequent adaptations."
Dallas Buyers Club,2013,7.9,"In 1985 Dallas, electrician and hustler Ron Woodroof works around the system to help AIDS patients get the medication they need after he is diagnosed with the disease.","It is one of great films who you do not know why you admire . Sure, acting, story, mix of rodeo and AIDS, the romance, the real facts ,the fight against bad system. But each represents only detail. Its message can be the best answer for see it more as revelation than as a good movie. The basic, small truths. And the force and art of Matthew McConaughey to propose something almost unexpected from him. Or a great Jared Leto . Short - just more than a film."
Hellboy II: The Golden Army,2008,7.0,A prince of the mythical world starts a rebellion against humanity in order to rule the Earth. Hellboy and his team must fight to stop him from locating the all-powerful Golden Army.,"A lot more fun than the original, though unlike many reviewers I kind of miss the darker, real-life villains. (Is anything hotter than Rasputin the Russian mystic making love to a stunning blonde Valkyrie of the SS?) Anyway, the cute elf princess and the fish-like Abe make a surprisingly romantic pair, the fight scenes rock, and the dialogue is sharp and funny almost all the time.Only one regret: I do wish they could have yanked ""Can't Smile Without You"" by Barry Manilow, and replaced it with a song with a bit more soul. I would suggest ""When A Man Loves A Woman"" by Percy Sledge. Or ""Hello Stranger"" by Barbara Lewis. Or ""Walk Like A Man"" by the Four Seasons. Or just about anything but Barry Manilow!"
Kingdom of Heaven,2005,7.3,"Balian of Ibelin travels to Jerusalem during the Crusades of the 12th century, and there he finds himself as the defender of the city and its people.","""Why was the Crusader braver then the pirate? Because he fought, not for himself, but for the Cross. What force was it that met him with a valor as reckless as his own? The force of men who fought, not for themselves, but for Islam. They took Spain from us, though we were fighting for our very hearths and homes; but when we, too, fought for that mighty idea, a Catholic Church, we swept them back to Africa.""Clearly, director Ridley Scott does not agree with the above somewhat simplified philosophy expressed by Shaw through his character Don Juan. In ""Kingdom of Heaven"", wars and battles are fuelled by an assortment of motivations including land, money, political consideration, natural desire for violence, lust for fame, love of the common people, among others. Even more importantly, this ""idea"" thing does not prevent leaders from practicing tolerance, reaching compromises and even recognizing equality with alien faiths, as the movie tries to show us.Recognizing that this movie is a mix of historical fact and dramatized fiction, let me focus on one rather unusual aspect of the hero Balian (Orlando Bloom), a blacksmith inheriting knighthood and an estate from a father appearing out of the blues. As Balian takes over the barren desert estate after the untimely death of the recently-discovered father, he does something that the father apparently has failed to do in all these years ¬ñ dig into the earth to find a reliable source of water and proceed to make the estate productive. Later, the resilient defence of Jerusalem owes just as much to Balian's knowledge of practical laws of mechanics as to his military skills. In the end, he turns away from the inherited knighthood and goes back to be a blacksmith, taking with him a queen. Triumph of the working class, as my summary line suggests.Depiction of the arch adversary Saladin follows very much the line taken in the novels of Sir Walter Scott (another Scott here!), particularly ""The Talisman"", as someone mysterious (to the extent of being almost omnipresent - in the novel) but wise and benevolent, a breed of political leader that is sadly in short supply today. The hero Balian, as mentioned, has little interest in divinity and every interest in the welfare of the people. These two leaders, put in today's context, could qualify ""Kingdom of Heaven"" for a fairy tale.It's difficult to refrain from comparing the attack of Jerusalem with the attack of Minas Tirith, and this very comparison can be construed as an unreserved compliment on Kingdom of Heaven. Another comparison that can be made is the depiction of a mighty army, done so unimaginatively in two similar movies last year. In Kingdom of Heaven, we see first a solitary figure on horseback at a distant mountain gap. ""Saladin's army of 200 thousand is here"" says Balian. ""There's only one person"", comes the reply from a follower. ""No, they're all here"" Balian quietly responses, at which point the angle of the camera starts to rise, first revealing the patch behind the mountain gap, filled with soldiers. Then, as the horizon of our vision continues to extend, layers of mountains and vales continue to appear, together with Saladin's mighty army deployed in an apparently haphazard, but ultimately strategic fashion. This must be seen to appreciate.Of the cast, I must first mention Edward Norton. As the leper king of Jerusalem, he appears all the time behind a mask which covers his entire face, showing only his eyes with disfigured corners. But it's the voice that is so mesmerizing. Ever since Fight Club, Norton's voice has such a timbre that soft as he sounds, there are lurking behind tantalizing hints of subtlety, intrigue, compassion, power, and twenty other different and conflicting emotions all at once.Bloom grows into his role, starting rather expressionless (which may not be totally unreasonable considering that the character has just lost a wife and a child) but gradually gaining in confidence. Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons, playing father and mentor respectively, do not exactly have the most challenging parts in their careers. Eva Green retains the girlish defiance in The Dreamer, but adds to it the maturity and allure required for the role of Sibylla (as portrayed by the script, but not necessarily as recorded in history). And there is good old Brendan Gleeson, in the customary role of big bully fighter which he has perfected in Gangs of New York and Troy.Kingdom of Heaven is one cut above Troy and Alexander last year."
The Aviator,2004,7.5,A biopic depicting the early years of legendary director and aviator Howard Hughes' career from the late 1920s to the mid 1940s.,"""The Aviator""--a biopic of Howard Hughes-- is clearly one of Scorsese's lesser works. Still, a lesser work from Scorsese is far superior to the greatest work of your average director. Here's the rundown:The first quarter of the film is a total triumph, showing the young Hughes' bold endeavors in film when he produced what was at the time the most expensive and lavish film ever made. Scorsese tipping his hat to old Hollywood is the most fun he has had since ""Goodfellas."" The costumes, set designs, and pacing of this portion of the film are stunning and suck the viewer in.The rest of the film, despite Scorsese's amazing and vivid attention to detail, is a muddled mess, giving us glimpses into Hughes' obsessive (and compulsive) ways, his womanizing, his ambitious foray into aviation and the early days of commercial flight, his fight against Congress at the end of WWII, and the notorious plight and ultimately single flight of his infamous ""Spruce Goose."" It's all semi-educational and semi-entertaining, but in the end I think the complicated life of Hughes remains a mystery.As for the performances, they are amazing (thanks in most part to Scorsese, the ultimate actor's director). Leonardo Dicaprio in the title role gives yet another performance that goes against my natural loathing of him, and although he seems a bit too boyish playing Hughes in the latter years (and the film really suffers for it), he's impeccable for the better part of the film. Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn is simply stunning and steals every moment she is on screen. Her look, her mannerisms, and her speech perfectly match the screen legend to a haunting degree. Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin in supporting quasi-villain roles are methodically perfect. And the nicest surprise was Kate Beckinsale, a normally flaccid actress, playing Ava Gardner. She came across as gorgeous, intelligent, and maximized her minimal screen time without ever overtly stealing her scenes. Like Sharon Stone in ""Casino"" and Cameron Diaz in ""Gangs of New York"" Scorsese once again coaxes a great performance out of an otherwise unremarkable pretty face.In the end, ""The Aviator"" flies high thanks to Scorsese and the acting, even if the real person it depicts remains lost in a muddle of half truths and speculation."
Marvin's Room,1996,6.7,"After seventeen years, a fiercely independent woman and her rebellious son return home and together they turn the family she left behind upside down.","It's such a wonderful story, not at all as dreary as one would expect. The late Scott McPherson injected so much humor and heart into this film, it's hard not to just go along with it. Diane Keaton got the Oscar nomination, but Meryl Streep's character drives the film, as she works her way back into a family she turned her back on so she could have a life of her own. She was right to do so, as her sister (Keaton) has become consumed with caregiving for her father and aunt, taking absolutely no time out for herself. The film also features a nice departure for Robert De Niro from his typically heavy roles. That alone is worth seeing, and fans of his typical performances should be forced to watch this.This quiet film may not have enough action for some, but it is far better than most films dealing with serious illness. The journey these sisters begin is something that has been explored in countless TV movies (think Lifetime), but what separates it is the humor and the character development that makes the viewer wish he/she could stay and watch the family long after the film ends. The film also benefits from the presence of Leonardo DiCaprio, who gives an unlikely nuanced performance as the older son who develops some character and helps his flighty mother grow along with him. The great thing about his presence in the film is that younger viewers (mostly female, probably) will be more likely to see this movie and get something out of it in the process.Finally, a word about Gwen Verdon and Hume Cronyn. Their contributions to this film are immeasurable. And as already mentioned, it's great that younger viewers can watch this film and get a last look at them in these touching roles and see how charm never fades with age. Cronyn has little to do but lie ill in bed, yet somehow his character remains a focal point. And Verdon's comic relief pairing with the younger son is a real highlight. She also manages a poignant moment or two in a her scenes with Keaton. This truly is an ensemble piece, and it wouldn't have been without their talent. Why I don't yet own a copy of this sweet film is a mystery."
Blood Diamond,2006,8.0,"A fisherman, a smuggler, and a syndicate of businessmen match wits over the possession of a priceless diamond.","The torturous road of South African diamonds to the greedy fingers of an indifferent world makes this new Edward Zwick movie one of the most powerful Action/Adventure/Dramas to come out of Hollywood in a long time. The perfect balance between entertainment and a thoughtful social commentary helps the center of the story to have a real heart and a palpable respect for us, the audience. All this praise and I still have not mentioned Leonardo Di Caprio or Djimon Hounsou but I'm going to. Di Caprio opens a new door, introducing us to a character who is a first in his already extraordinary career. He startled us as a very young man with ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" before he fell with a serious case of Titanictis. Now, after a three a long and serious Scorsese cures, this spectacular actor makes me believe that we haven't seen anything yet. Remarkable. As remarkable as the soulful Djimon Hounsou who manages to give the film a visible soul. I was moved and yes, I must admit, surprised. Apart from the visual and interpretative prowess of ""Blood Diamond"" there is a realistic view of a third world country as shattering as the unforgettable one in ""City Of God"" Don't miss it."
The Beach,2000,6.6,"On vacation in Thailand, Richard sets out for an island rumored to be a solitary beach paradise.","Paradise - the search of it. Where are we at home? Could we live anywhere? Could we do without all the technical gadgets? I'm not saying living alone (though for some that may be the way to do and live it), but living without certain things that make life ""easier"" ... or at least that is how we perceive it.Nature can be quite the enticing thing. And it is in this movie too. The Beach that lends the movie the title is quite the sight. And for a vacation spot ... I mean you could do far worse. Now there had been rumors that the filming was done on a beach or in a place that was supposed to not be touched by western civilization ... I remember Leonardo DiCaprio getting quite a lot of heat because some activists were not happy with him.I can't confirm if they actually loitered or ruined nature in one way or another. If that really interests you, you surely will know a way to find out. I just thought I give an insentive to those who are interested in behind the scenes thing - real or not. Then there is also those who may take offense in the portrayal of certain animals (feeding into our fears and portraying them way more evil than they actually are - talking sharks here).The movie itself is quite the decent thriller. Because the Paradise is not all fun and games. It is also filled with cliches and quite the predictable plot. Still the movie knows to hold up its tension and has quite a few gruesome moments too (graphic violence that is). Not a bad movie then, but not a masterpiece either in my book (while I came to finally admire Leo, his character here is not as relatable - choices and such. There's a general detachment from it all)"
Romeo Juliet,1996,6.7,Shakespeare's famous play is updated to the hip modern suburb of Verona still retaining its original dialogue.,"Reviewers say 'Romeo + Juliet' is a bold, modern adaptation praised for vibrant visuals, energetic direction, and stellar performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. The contemporary setting and pop culture elements are lauded for making the story accessible. However, the film faces criticism for the jarring contrast between modern settings and Shakespearean language, uneven acting, and over-the-top stylistic choices. Despite these issues, many appreciate its ambition and success in introducing Shakespeare to a new audience."
Catch Me If You Can,2002,8.1,"Barely 17 yet, Frank is a skilled forger who has passed as a doctor, lawyer and pilot. FBI agent Carl becomes obsessed with tracking down the con man, who only revels in the pursuit.","Reviewers say 'Catch Me If You Can' highlights Steven Spielberg's adept direction and storytelling, effectively blending suspense with humor. The cat-and-mouse chase between Frank Abagnale Jr. and FBI agent Carl Hanratty is well-executed, with dynamic cinematography and immersive period detail. However, some critics find the film's length and certain plot elements exaggerated, impacting believability. Despite this, it is generally regarded as an entertaining, well-crafted piece showcasing Spielberg's narrative skill."
Sleepers,1996,7.5,A reporter and a District Attorney help childhood friends who killed a sadistic guard.,"I really liked this movie. Great acting, great direction, great plot!As another reviewer pointed out, the movie indeed has 3 parts. before,at and after the correction center. All three parts are equaly gripping. Except that the part in the correction center is very dark and disturbing.Brad Pitt shines in a small role he  has. So does Jason Patrick. Hoffman has his ususal confused charisma. Rest of the supporting cast is excellent too. Especially the denizens of hell's kitchen. Kevin Bacon looks realy menacing. But the person who realy shows his caliber again is de niro. He has one of these rare ""non-swearing"" roles of his. There is a scene where Jason Patric tells the story of the abuses they faced, and the camera focusses on Robert De Niro's face. Only thing changes is his eyes, from sharp and focussed at the first, you see them widening and then you see some trace of tears. Great! This scence reminds me of Omar Shariff standing on a balcony while soldiers start mayhem on the streets, in Dr. Zhivago.A good care has been taken in getting child stars and adult stars look pretty similar.Only thing li'll bit out of the place is constant referance to Count of montecristo. The revenge in the book is ""sweet lasting revenge"" where in this movie its straight shot. But heck! this is real life!the last night the friends spend together is also really touching.my rating 9/10."
The Host,2013,5.8,"When an unseen enemy threatens mankind by taking over their bodies and erasing their memories, Melanie Stryder risks everything to protect the people she cares about.","The Host has an intriguing conceit. It is about a post-apocalypse where aliens take control on every human body then the remaining unpossessed humans fear them despite that these aliens only want peace. The story might have an idea that the humans could be the real enemy here or it's just both of them. The Sci-Fi bits are pretty interesting but it doesn't end there. It's based on a young adult novel so definitely there will be teenage hormones scattered around the context. It has romance that is suppose to save their world and change their lives, but once again just like any other young adult film, the romance is nothing more than a bunch of good looking people falling in love and doing romantic clich√© stuff. Love may not be a problem to these stories but this romance is terribly empty. They're just making out and saying ridiculously cheesy lines. It would have been a fascinating idea but it just can't get away from its typical teen angst.It is kind of similar to the recent young adult novel based film, Warm Bodies, except the antagonists in The Host are virtuous beings instead of ravenous monsters. It seems that both stories have the same morality. Humans are not the most peaceful beings either and maybe the order and mentality of both sides are the reason why they couldn't get along. When it goes to the romance, it says that Melanie and Wanda's love between the boys might revolt their world's condition. But it strays from its plot giving us a lousily told story and romance. Mostly the romance. It is noticeable that most of their ""love"" only rely on their lips. Which means they kiss a lot. We do not get to know much about why they care for each other, other than being one of the last normal human beings of their age. It is also filled with plot holes because of course it wants to appeal teens for the endless love that didn't even work. It is directed by Andrew Niccol who is somewhat a Sci-Fi expert but it looks like he's afraid that too much Sci-Fi than romance might disappoint these children. He could have been more indulgent.The film has a solid cast but not all of them standout. Saoirse Ronan plays two roles here and she fills enough heart on both characters. Diane Kruger looks like she is enjoying playing the film's villain. The roles of Max Irons and Jake Abel seems to be only designed for kissing, slapping, and sometimes strangling, leaving William Hurt being the only likable gentleman of the picture.The script explains some points of the concept which is fine in that way in spite of the plot holes but it gets terrible on the romance. There are dialogues that may get way out of hand, ends up being laughable. Even more laughable is one scene when the protagonist tries to wake up her subconscious by kissing her boyfriend. I don't know if I should blame anyone about it. I mean what choice does she have? Still, it's ridiculous. The film is at least stunning. It gets to explore something magnificent around. The exteriors serves a lot of intrigue to its world. It features shiny cars and choppers. Most of the action are well shot even though the action itself isn't really that interesting but everything in the film looks good.The Host is not interesting enough. It thematically talks about peace and stuff. Well, you can make peace out of love but the film only shows kissing and I think there is more in love than just making out. Hormonally, this could be a perfect escapism for teens. An apocalyptic world about relationships of these good looking couples with fast awesome cars crashing on the road. But the story seems to offer more. Again, they are unable to show it because the only fan service for adaptations of teen books is to follow every single sequence from the book because they love comparing. Too bad, they could have also shown what's behind the words as well. The Host is another victim of a generic young adult film adaptation that doesn't understand much of the meaning of the story, and throw away the most bland of all romances."
The Basketball Diaries,1995,7.3,A teenager finds his dreams of becoming a basketball star threatened after he free falls into the harrowing world of drug addiction.,"The Basketball Diaries is the story of the true experiences of Jim Carroll, underground poet and entertainer, and how he overcame drug addiction to become what he is today.Leonardo DiCaprio has done a magnificent and extraordinary job portraying the lead character. He makes you feel the pain that Jim was going through. His emotions are so pure and realistic that you'll fall in love with his character.This movie is a must watch for young people who get into drug addiction and spoil their lives. It portrays the mindset of teenagers and youngsters and the consequences of their actions.It's difficult to realize your mistake but the sad part is that even after realization, you think you can't do anything about it. You think it's too late when it's not. It's actually never too late.Leonardo plays a character who is a talented basketball player, who gets involved in drugs along with his friends. After that he leaves everything even his mother and the only thing left in his life was drugs.Slowly and steadily this addiction can get you into a lot of trouble and situations that it may become impossible for you to make everything right again.Overall, it's an important movie with a lot of powerful performances."
I Am Sam,2001,7.6,An intellectually disabled man fights for custody of his 7-year-old daughter and in the process teaches his cold-hearted lawyer the value of love and family.,"I Am Sam is a great movie that deals with marginalized people in our society and how they're treated. It's a very realistic portrayal. I watched it with my 13 year old daughter and it alternately made us cry, got us angry and caused us to laugh uncontrollably.Sam is loved and respected by those who know him (Starbuck's patrons, IHOP Waitress, friends), taunted by those who have no regard for anyone different (Lucy's arrogant classmate and his equally arrogant father) and generally misunderstood by everyone else.I especially liked the irony of the lawyer, who is an emotional train wreck, yet because she's an adult intellecutally, no one questions her ability as a parent. Sam on the other hand loves his daughter and it shows.This movie is not for anyone looking for a ""fun weekend rent"". If you rent this, be prepared to have your values and your emotions challenged."
Scent of a Woman,1992,8.0,"A prep school student needing money agrees to ""babysit"" a blind man, but the job is not at all what he anticipated.","Al Pacino (The Godfather, Looking for Richard) won an Oscar for Best Actor for  his outstanding performance as  Lt. Col. Frank Slade.  I have the tape and have watched it a bazillion times. I have seen many other actors playing a blind man but Pacino outwits them all. I have watched it closely just to watch his eyes. He is terrific!  Every time we watch the movie we spend at least two days going: ""Oo-rah!"" I like prep school movies and I have two movies where Chris O'Donnell (Circle of Friends) Charlie Simms is in a prep school. I guess it goes with his type. I like the part of  Charlie who is doing the best he can with the weekend he has to face. One of the most difficult things for people is to feel is useless. That is how Lt. Co. Frank Slade feels. He also has a cynicism about life that in a sense is funny because of its irony.  He meets Charlie and has everything planned out.  The Colonel has extremely good taste.  Meeting young Charlie, who is in a very difficult situation, the outspoken Lt. Col. found a reason to live and to feel useful again, even enjoying the smell of the perfume of Charlie's teacher.  I did not see the 1974 Italian film ""PROFUMO DI DONNA,"" but would love to see the performance of the late Vittorio Gassman, one of the most well known actor of the Italian Theater and Cinema. My Favorite Scenes: Lt. Col. driving in New York city, dancing tango, and giving a speech before the student body, to clear up Charlie's name. This is a great movie! My Favorite Quotes: Lt. Col. Frank Slade: ""Oo-rah!"" ...""  But there isn't nothing' like the sight of an amputated spirit, there is no prosthetic for that..""   ""There are two kinds of people in this world, Charlie. The first group are the people that face the music; the second group are those who run for cover. Cover is better."""
Flight,2012,7.3,Troubling questions arise after airline pilot Whip Whitaker makes a miracle landing after a mid-air catastrophe.,"Flight (2012)**** (out of 4)Denzel Washington turns in one of the strongest performances of his career playing Walt Whitaker, a pilot who becomes an overnight hero after he saves the majority of the passengers on a doomed plane. Soon after becoming a hero Walt starts to get questioned on whether or not he was up all night partying and in fact was flying the plane drunk and soon he's forced to face himself and the events. Robert Zemeckis has certainly delivered a very entertaining, honest and depressing look at a man who seems to be good at just about everything except being honest with himself. Going into the picture I really wasn't sure what to expect but the film turned out to be great from start to finish and it's certainly one of the more honest looks at an alcoholic to come along in a while. The screenplay by John Gatins is extremely well-written and I think it deserves a lot of credit because I really appreciated the way we get to know this character. Because it's Denzel you're automatically going to want him to do good but the challenging aspects of the screenplay are so well handled by the actor and director that you really do feel like you're getting a complete character study. Zemeckis adds in some great song selections, the cinematography is top notch and there's no question that the film contains some excellent and tense drama. The Q&S session is perfectly handled and the crash sequence is one of the most chilling I've ever seen. Washington is excellent in the role of the troubled pilot as he contains that charm we all love but it also gives the actor a chance to give a full performance. He's so great at everything he does I think he often doesn't get the chance to do a role as complete as this one but he proves why he's one of the best out there. John Goodman, Don Cheadle and Kelly Reilly are all great in their supporting roles as well. You've also got to give everyone credit for not watering down the material and going for a safe and clean PG-13 rating. While there's nothing overly offensive here, the R-rating does allow for an honest and open look at this very flawed character. FLIGHT is certainly one of the years best films."
We Own the Night,2007,6.8,A New York City nightclub manager tries to save his brother and father from Russian Mafia hitmen.,"On the whole I think James Gray's movies benefit from his smooth directing, no rushed and furious MTV editing. This leads to a good deal of leniency from the part of critics (as with Night Shyamalan before it became too obvious he was shooting the same narrative structure over and over), a kind of prime for directors who don't harass the viewer with images + sounds but let the camera roll and the actors do their jobs, the story unfold and so on.We Own the Night starts very well, the exposure is excellent. Even though the brother confrontation is definitely not new Joaquin Phoenix is so good you just get into the story and beg for the plot to become more complicated. Oops. The problem is the story becomes a one-way highway of the same old/same old. Joaquin Phoenix is ever so good you don't care too much until it becomes way way too much. In that respect (and lack of respect for the movie-goer) the movie ends in a lame way, rushing an happy and clean and tidy and moral conclusion.The last lines (see the so-called ""memorable quotes"") say it all. It perfectly reflects that a smooth director may be too smooth on writing. Bringing sentiments before the camera is miles away from shooting scripted sentimentalism and I think James Gray has a problem with his characters' emotions since he is only able to play on pathos and good acting."
The Bank Job,2008,7.2,Martine offers Terry a lead on a foolproof bank hit on London's Baker Street. She targets a roomful of safe deposit boxes worth millions in cash and jewelry along with a treasure trove of dirty secrets.,"As caper flicks go, all I really hope for is something that succeeds in being both novel and entertaining. My hopes were satisfied by The Bank Job. The plot itself is based very loosely on events that occurred in the 1970s in London. The royal family has some dark secrets. An outspoken activist/petty criminal/drug importer has evidence of these secrets, which he uses as leverage against the government who desperately wants to prosecute him. This evidence is stored in a safety deposit box within a London bank. British Intelligence conjures up a rather reckless plan of employing a bunch of two-bit/amateur criminals to break into the vault, and take the evidence along with whatever else they can carry out. Apart from one intermediary, none of the robbers know the government's secret agenda. Of course, things get complicated whenever the possibility that a bunch of dirty secrets are in the wrong hands, and eventually the movie juggles several interconnecting plot lines, all related to the contents of the vault and their implication on various interests from the royal family, to corrupt police, to the sexual indiscretions of parliament members.The movie keeps a good pace and never takes itself too seriously. It builds up the plot lines and tries somewhat successfully to tie everything together. There is some good tension, a bit of violence (not much), and eventually, vindication for most of the parties.The problems with the movie are numerous, but nothing that ultimately destroys the fun. Yes the movie is rife with inexplicably, unnecessary side characters (see female undercover agent in the Caribbean). Yes the movie's dialogue veers into indecipherable 1970s British slang, which gives a comedic undertone to conversations that are intended to be serious. Yes there exist rampant plot issues that make you wonder how stupid cops really are. And yes the acting is OK, at best, lets face it Jason Stracham is meant for British caper movies the way Keanu Reeves is meant to play a clueless surfer cop in Point Break - so while he's not winning any Academies, he fits these rolls just fine.You could wait for the DVD, or if you are looking for a fun way to kill 2 hours, you should go to the theater for this one."
Traitor,2008,6.9,"When straight arrow FBI agent Roy Clayton heads up the investigation into a dangerous international conspiracy, all clues seem to lead back to former U.S. Special Operations officer, Samir Horn.","As a young child living in Yemen ""Samir Horn"" (Don Cheadle) experiences the death of his father in a car bomb planted by terrorists. Afterward his mother takes him to America where he grows up and eventually joins the army as a demolitions expert. After separating from the army he begins to sell explosive detonators to the highest bidder which eventually leads him to a Muslim terrorist movement in Sudan. Unfortunately, while a meeting is taking place he is arrested and sent to a prison and upon his escape joins a terrorist movement which has use for his skills. At any rate, rather than disclose the rest of the story and risk ruining the film for those who haven't seen it I will just that that this was a pretty good action film with some drama and suspense thrown in for good measure. I especially liked the performance of Don Cheadle who I thought played the part to near perfection. Above average."
Harry Brown,2009,7.2,An elderly ex-serviceman and widower looks to avenge his best friend's murder by doling out his own form of justice.,"Watched this at a London preview screeningThis is an enjoyable, and often tense vigilante film. But don't look for a radical plot line or unpredictable twists because this is simply a straight forward and predictable Death Wish style vigilante story. I'll give absolutely no credit to the screenplay writer for that.But full marks to the director for turning up the high tensions to make this still an exciting film. Having lived in a council estate myself, I know how frightening some youngsters are and can be more terrifying than the recent flurry of zombie films.However, this is Michael Caine's show and is a fine addition to the recent surge of old tough guys fighting back movies such as Gran Torino. Caine was brilliant as usual. He makes the most of a pitifully typical script. That is of a widower seeking violent vengeance on the youths who killed his friend. He played it subtle and his vigilante transition was done just right. He isn't turned into some unrealistic slick killing machine or a Rambo. He has typical elderly obstacles such as breathing problems, slow reflexes and old bones but some of his military skills give him a chance. There is a also a sub plot involving a female detective on his trail but it so underwritten, I just didn't care.The actors playing the youths were very very convincing and help to root for our pensioner hero even more. So it is satisfying to see our legendary cockney actor clean up some really nasty bad guys."
Lord of War,2005,7.6,An arms dealer confronts the morality of his work as he is being chased by an INTERPOL Agent.,"""Lord of War"" is about a man named Yuri (Nicolas Cage) who in the early 80's decides that he doesn't want to just work in a restaurant for the rest of his life and decides that instead he wants to be an arms dealer. Once he makes his first sale, Yuri is hooked on the feeling of making big money for selling firearms, and continues to sell the firearms but he wants more and more of a profit and more and more of a challenge. It's not until an Interpol agent (Ethan Hawke) is hot on Yuri's case that he begins to question the nature of his business and whether what he is doing for a living is moral and if he should be responsible for the hands these weapons get into and what they are used for. A powerful performance by Nicolas Cage, as well as a great thought-provoking movie ensues¬Ö I love movies like this one for a few reasons. The main reason is that for the most part you can't predict what is going to happen next or where the film is going. Another reason I like movies like this is because it's powerful and its makes you think. And lastly I like a movie like this because it doesn't end in a typical way and actually leaves you feeling blown-away and surprised.The filmed starred Nicolas Cage who lately has done of some the best work of his career. His performance here is top-notch and powerful. There are so many other people in the film including Jared Leto, Ian Holm, Ethan Hawke and Bridget Moynahan to name a few who are also very good at the roles they played. This film is written and directed by Andre Niccol the same man who wrote ""The Terminal"" and ""The Truman Show"" so I guess I shouldn't be so surprised by why I actually liked this film so much, it had a good lead actor and a good screenwriter.I guess this movie all comes down to how open minded the movie-goers who see this are. I guess it also amounts to where you stand on the political fence. The film is not for those who don't have an open mind about things that are going on in the world today. The movie is based on true events so be warned that some of things shown in the film are happening in real life or did happen at one point in time. To be honest, I do believe what the film states in the end, it doesn't seem at all far fetched. It's like Yuri says in the film ""it's not our war and no matter what we do we can't stop it"" and that's true it's like smoking kills people every day but there are people who run cigarette companies everyday knowing that they are killing people every single day and getting people addicted to something that in the end will kill them. Is that moral? What can we do to stop it? These are questions this film asks and leaves it to the viewer to decide on.So in the end, this movie isn't for everyone. In a sense this film is kind of like the movie ""Blow"" because it's about a man who feels his life isn't complete without selling something that is bad. He has everything he could ever want but still needs to sell the firearms. It's an amazing and powerful story which I feel really puts things in perspective as far as us Americans look at things. Nicolas Cage's performance is incredible as he seems to not care at all for the people's lives he puts at stake every day and when it comes to his own life he still seems unemotional and doesn't seem to worry. Personally I think this is one of the best film's of year and is in fact just as good as the other political drama currently released called ""The Constant Gardner"" so if you have an open mind about things and enjoy movies that will make you think, well check out ""Lord of War"" because it's well worth the price of admission at the theater.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Lord of War"" is a 9/10."
The Fisher King,1991,7.5,"A former radio DJ, suicidally despondent because of a terrible mistake he once made, finds redemption in helping a mentally unstable homeless man who was an innocent victim of that mistake.","This movie is really exceptional in a lot of ways. It's got one of those plots, full of ironic reversals and personal struggle, that's been turned into melodramatic trash in every creative medium ever invented. With Robin Williams as the magic crazy guy and Jeff Bridges in an 80s ponytail, the ways the basic concept could have gone awry (in other hands) are truly frightening to contemplate. But with Terry Gilliam at the helm, The Fisher King speaks to your emotions more directly and powerfully than 90% of the movies out there without degenerating into sappiness.Perhaps the most brilliant acheivement of this movie is the way it takes Robin Williams' crazy-improvisational persona and makes it an integral part of the story. Instead of being a tacked-on adjunct to the ""real"" movie, Williams' stream-of-consciousness patter is essential to the work as a whole.At the same time, Gilliam is making an almost-mainstream movie for the first time in his career, while explicitly referencing his past (the Holy Grail). It all comes together into a movie you will never forget."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,2003,5.0,The Angels investigate a series of murders which occur after the theft of a witness protection profile database.,"This movie is one half Mission Impossible and one half Airplane. The combination of which not only requires 'suspension of disbelief', but I'd say you need to string your disbelief up by the roof beams and flog it mercilessly.If I haven't been clear enough, let me put it plainly: do not, I repeat, do not take this movie seriously in any way, shape or form.That much should be obvious in the first 2 minutes when we see the angels walk into a Mongolian prison camp and start riding a mechanical bull to the tune of ""Wild Thang"" while kicking the asses of hundreds of 300-lb men. I won't tell you what happens in the next 2 minutes, but it makes the first 2 minutes look like a nature documentary.I saw this movie last night and I'm still not sure what the plot is. But it was thoroughly entertaining (especially for a hetero guy who enjoys gratuitous booty shots). Some gags were pretty funny, while others were so lame you have to laugh anyway. But really the comedy is the fact that everything is so unbelievably unbelievable.Glancing at some of the reviews here, I see that the tongue-in-cheek comedy was lost on a lot of people, and instead of having a good time they probably ended up hurling things at their TV screen. I'm just here to warn you, do not fall into that trap. Realize that it's a comedy. It panders to the lowest brain cell in your skull. And it delivers a wild ride.P.S. The soundtrack absolutely kicks butt. J Geils Band, Bon Jovi, Loverboy, David Bowie, Journey... if you were alive & remotely cool in the 80s, you'll really dig it."
21 Grams,2003,7.6,"A freak accident brings together a critically ill mathematician, a grieving mother, and a born-again ex-con.","Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu made a well-deserved leap into the renown film-making pool with Amores Perros, and his follow up 21 Grams shows him with plenty of talent to spare. He also gets three (or more, depends on how effective one thinks the supporting performance were) forceful, compelling performances out of Sean Penn, Benicio Del-Torro, and Naomi Watts. They're involved in three interlocking stories- Penn as a mathematician with a rottening health and a near-rottening relationship; Del-Torro's found Jesus Christ after being in and out of jail for part of his life; Watts is a house-wife who may have some deep troubles within her mind. Each of the three leads doesn't go for cheap drama, and each one plunges the depths of their own abilities to find truths that might not be possible with lesser material or a lesser director. I won't say much more about the stories, however I do have something to say about the structure of the film. The script brings some mesmerizing scenes, ones with great tragedy that bring out a viewer's compassion.Never-the-less, there was something about the structure that I didn't think was all that great. In films like Once Upon a Time in America, Reservoir Dogs, and even Memento, the scrambled story structure had a purpose, adding appropriate twists and turns for the audience. 21 Grams (like Amores Perros in a sense) has that non-linear basis to it too, and sometimes it works for the audience to react. But I think there would be a lot more power to how these characters' fates and tragedies unfold if it was told linearly from start to finish. In many moments in the film I found myself knowing a little too much before a particular scene unfolded, or I found myself guessing about something that I didn't need to (one of the points of non-linear storytelling is answers first, questions later). It wasn't an aspect that made the film bad, yet the stock that writer Guillermo Arriaga and director Inarritu put into this structure over interlocking the stories in order, or perhaps telling each story separately, is the film's only drawback."
The Terminal,2004,7.4,An Eastern European tourist unexpectedly finds himself stranded at JFK airport and must take up temporary residence there.,"'A good movie makes us forget that we are sitting inside a theatre'Sometimes life corners you.

Despicable Me,2010,7.6,"Gru, a criminal mastermind, adopts three orphans as pawns to carry out the biggest heist in history. His life takes an unexpected turn when the little girls see the evildoer as their potential father.","Since Toy Story 3 is in theatres, it's rather knee-jerk to compare Despicable Me to the animation giant. But you shouldn't. Despicable Me doesn't have the heavy, dark tones of the final Toy Story and, therefore, is probably better suited to smaller children. As with the best family films, though, adults will love this story as much - if not more - than their little ones.And here's why. It is incredibly rare to see a single dad portrayed in such a positive light. While Gru has an admittedly ""bad"" vocation, there are unbelievably sweet moments between him and the three children, probably aided by the juxtaposition of tiny girls to a large, ""bad"" guy.The nepotistic supporting cast from Saturday Night Live (even Jack McBrayer works for Tina Fey) is fantastic. One pleasant surprise was from Gru's minions: they did not steal the show. Not that they should've- the little yellow guys were funny and entertaining, but one would expect from the previews they would ultimately be the best part of the film... and I'm happy to report that wasn't true.Despicable Me is LOL funny throughout, warm, goofy, and will not disappoint. I'd say you're a despicable parent if you don't take your kids to see it immediately."
Just Cause,1995,6.4,A Harvard professor is lured back into the courtroom after twenty-five years to take the case of a young black man condemned to death for the horrific murder of a child.,I read some previous comments stating that this movie loses steam towards the end of the movie and also that it has a similar ending to Cape Fear. I completely disagree. I'm going to give a simple review for the normal moviegoers out there. I thought the casting was perfect. I thought this was one of Ed Harris's best performances. What an evil psychopath!!! I have a lot of respect for his acting after viewing his performance in this movie. I was riveted throughout this movie. If you like mystery thrillers then this definitely a movie you want to see. I also noticed a young Scarlett Johannson in this movie. This movie is filled with top stars and I highly recommend it!
Fracture,2007,7.2,"After shooting his wife, Ted confesses his crime and asks the court to move his case to trial. He represents himself against Willy, a successful lawyer. But there's more to the case than meets the eye.","""Fracture"" (2007) is directed by Gregory Hoblit who has also made ""Frequency"" (2000), ""Fallen"" (1998) both of which I like and ""Primal Fear"" (1996) - his feature debut that I love.Crime /Thriller/Mystery /Court Drama are among my favorite genres and as long as the combination of these genres is clever, gripping, atmospheric, well acted, keeps me guessing and entertains me, I am happy. I know that many viewers were very insightful and figured out the twists and the ending within first half of hour or so but I did not and I was impressed by the way the disappearance of the crucial evidence had been handled - very clever. Besides being an entertaining crime movie, the most interesting element of ""Fracture"" is a struggle of wills and intellects between two main characters, self-made inventor - millionaire Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) who shot his unfaithful wife in the face and put her in a coma and young, successful and smart assistant D.A. Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling), who has a 97% conviction rate and is assigned to prosecute Crawford just when he is ready to accept a lucrative offer from the prestigious LA law firm. The game of cat and mouse that highly intelligent and malevolent Crawford plays with Beachum makes the film interesting and the scenes between Hopkins (in his ""playful Dr. Lector"" mode) and Gosling (whose character does change as he realizes what he is dealing with from the unsympathetic self-centered hot shot to the man who becomes obsessed by the case, vows to put the murderer behind the bars and makes it his priority) - riveting and joy to watch. I also would like to mention David Strathairn as Willy's boss, DA Joe Lobuto in yet another understated effective performance. Strathairn's Lobuto is so interesting that he could be a main character in another move. ""Fracture"" is not perfect. For example, Willy's affair with Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike), a beautiful lawyer and his perspective boss was lifeless - they did not have any chemistry together. I think that Nikki's purpose in the movie was to introduce Willy to her father, a judge, whose help he would desperately need in one of the later scenes. I'd rather prefer more scenes between Willy and Crawford but even the way it was, the movie kept my attention all the way through and despite the rather weak ending, I found ""Fracture"" quite good."
Thelma & Louise,1991,7.6,"Two best friends set out on an adventure, but it soon turns around to a terrifying escape from being hunted by the police, as these two women escape for the crimes they committed.","THELMA & LOUISE has to be regarded as a pure 90s classic that brought up a considerable amount of risk in creating a first-person feminist formula into a mainstream movie, which is often missing. It pulls off fantastically true in form, with the exceptional Southern character talents of the two lady fugitives on the run, Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon, who may stand out as memorable on the silver screen. Let's not forget that silly truck driver they pass quite often, and of course, cowboy Brad Pitt as a young student. While not needed to be fully reliant on action substances like gunshooting, there is good chemistry within its grasp. Every single minute should not be wasteful, as plenty of refreshing outbursts of enjoyment outweighs the familiar old plot of evading the police. The ending is a definite eye catcher, and also the riskiest ever filmed! Beware of this rip-off called GOOD GIRLS DON'T, another poor B-movie with no redeeming quality. Satisfyingly original, and highly recommended!"
A Few Good Men,1992,7.7,A military lawyer intends to prove that two US Marines charged with murdering a fellow Marine were only following their base commander's orders.,"A young hotshot naval lawyer (Cruise) is given what seems to be an open and shut case of two marines murdering another while he slept. Cruise, who has a reputation for plea bargaining was assigned by division, to defend the accused. Could it be so it never sees the inside of a courtroom?Over seeing the defence of the accused is Demi Moore, from internal affairs, who is renowned for her attention to detail. She believes their innocence and suspects a cover up.In charge of the marine unit in question is Jack Nicholson, a hard-ass marine who commands respect and demands the best.With outstanding performances from Jack Nicholson, Tom Cruise, and Yes Demi Moore as well. The plot develops, and the conspiracy surrounding the case becomes apparent. And its up to Cruise to lay his career on the line to find the truth.This movie is a powerful drama, and is fantastically well made.I love it 10/10"
The Godfather Part III,1990,7.6,"Follows Michael Corleone, now in his 60s, as he seeks to free his family from crime and find a suitable successor to his empire.","This film came out about the same time as Goodfellas, and pales in comparison with the Martin Scorsese effort. I know the two shouldn't be compared, but the fact that they are both gangster films begs some sort of comparison.Does Godfather III ""complete"" Coppola's Godfather series? Only in the sense that we see what happens to Michael when he is an old man.  In my opinion, we didn't really need to know that.  To me, the Godfather films ended with Michael Corleone as a shell of a man after losing his wife and murdering his brother.Besides, I'm of the view that the best American films of the 20th century were made in the 1970s."
Csak szex √©s m√°s semmi,2005,6.3,"Dora rejects all men when she discovers that her fiance has been living a double life with another woman throughout their relationship (he was married).

When she finds that her choices are limited to three men: Tamas, Ali, and Peter,...Read all","I am a male and I rarely watch romantic comedies, this genre is not really my cup of tea by default, I usually only watch this type of movies only in the companion of a girl, but I have to admit I absolutely like this movie. It is a Hungarian romantic comedy with a little bit of drama in it.I remember first watching this movie at my local theatre when it was released in Hungary in 2005. It was a national holiday, the movie theatres were open, but there was not really anything playing that was of my interest, so I decided to watch this movie. And boy, what a good decision it was, I was pleasantly surprised with this movie.Good basic premise, well drawn up, very likeable characters, played by actresses and actors who are perfect for their roles and who are all on top of their games and play those characters perfectly. The humour is the right type (at least for me), the dialogues are good, lifelike and funny, the two main actresses are young and beautiful, and sometimes scantily clad, and there is even a little bit of female (and a bit of male) nudity in it if that is what you are after. :)
At the end of the movie there is a happy ending, everybody finds the right partner. And be warned, shortly after the end credits start rolling, there are a few more scenes that are part of the story and conclude the story. Also, as extra entertainment, during the closing credits there are bloopers, outtakes where the cast members made a mistake in the scene, these are also great fun. I think the best way to watch the movie is to watch it in its original Hungarian, because the dialogues, the jokes, the slang come over best in Hungarian, it is not always possible to translate them into English perfectly. Obviously, this option is only available to Hungarian speakers.I am very picky when it comes to which movie to include in my blu-ray collection, but this movie definitely earned its place in my collection.A well-written, well-acted, well-made, funny and very enjoyable romantic comedy. This is my favourite Hungarian movie and my favourite romantic comedy of all time. Perfect entertainment, a resounding 10 out of 10. Highly recommended."
"Sex, Lies, and Videotape",1989,7.2,A sexually repressed woman's husband is having an affair with her sister. The arrival of a visitor with a rather unusual fetish changes everything.,"I have to admit this is one film that surprised me. I didn't really expect to like it, thinking it was going to be just another talkfest. But sure as the wind blows, as the story progressed, it dragged me in.Andie MacDowell in pretty much her first leading role, really surprised me with an extremely compelling performance as the well-meaning wife caught in a dull almost sexless marriage , who at the film's outset, may well believe she is at fault, and requiring of psychiatric therapy. I've been a fan since way back with Greystoke, where her Jane was dubbed by Glenn Close. (Why I don't really know?). But there have always been critical musings concerning her alleged lack of acting ability. All I can say, is that there were instances in the second half of SL&T, where I thought she was mesmerising.Laura San Giacomo plays her sassy, uninhibited bartender sister Cynthia, who is having a long-term affair with John, Ann's husband. Into the mix is introduced Graham, an old friend of John's whose own repressions and the means he has of relieving them, will end up casting plenty of light on the title's secrets and lies. James Spader gives an understated, but alluring performance as Graham, whose knack of attracting women to talk openly about their sexual secrets on videotape, will force all four lead characters to face truths about themselves and each other.In his debut feature, writer/director Stephen Soderbergh openly reveals the creative hand he has consistently played over the years across a range of movie genres; the presentation of frank, realistic, smart dialogue. He was only 26 when he made this film and though I don't see this as being a ""great movie"" per se, it is easy after seeing it, to appreciate why Soderbergh is frequently regarded as the most influential independent director of late 20th century North American cinema."
Insomnia,2002,7.2,A Los Angeles detective chases a murder suspect in a remote Alaskan town.,"INSOMNIA is not only the third film of acclaimed director Christopher Nolan (his first two were FOLLOWINGS and MEMENTO), but also a film that is able to intertwine the acting talents of three Academy Award winners.  Al Pacino plays a celebrated cop who is asked to work on the case of a murdered girl in Alaska.  Hilary Swank plays the local law enforcement who has her eyes on making a big case.  Robin Williams plays a troubled Alaskan writer.  Without giving anything away, INSOMNIA is definitely worth it.  Some may see it, and be disappointed.  One way to steer away from this failure is think of INSOMNIA as a psychological thriller rather than a ""Shoot 'em up"" thriller. INSOMNIA is story about loyalty and human emotion.  Don't get me wrong, the movie is thrill-packed, but let's just say--You don't need blood and gore to make the audience members be on the edge of their seats (which I was). INSOMNIA hits all of its points including acting, directing, screenwriting, and cinematography.  It's a first class thriller with great characters.  On a side note...Pacino is worthy of an Oscar for his performance, Williams is equally excellent, and Swank also deserves recognition for complete scope of acting.  A job well done by these three actors, and especially the man behind the curtain, Christopher Nolan!"
The Big Blue,1988,7.5,"The rivalry between Enzo and Jacques, two childhood friends and now world-renowned free divers, becomes a beautiful and perilous journey into oneself and the unknown.","The film starts with an island view in black and white Greece. Throughout the film I encounter wonderful scenes. Blue color is peaceful and watching the endless expanse of the Mediterranean is enjoyable. I was very happy for acting. 
I think that people who are interested in diving and the sea should not go on without watching. The final scene was very impressive. 
It is a very beautiful film that brings happiness and sadness together."
Ronin,1998,7.2,A freelancing former U.S. intelligence agent tries to track down a mysterious package that's wanted by both the Irish and the Russian governments.,"A pretty decent action outing for Robert De Niro and John Frankenheimer. Good photography of some of the seedier neighborhoods of Paris and other French cities. This film is quintessential De Niro, and he gets all the good lines. There is an interesting revelation at the end, which I will not reveal here. The case everyone is after, is a complete McGuffin, what Hitchcock called that plot device, the thing which everyone wants, and it doesn't really matter exactly what that is. I think that Frankenheimer may have been paying homage to Hitchcock on this, as what is in the case is never revealed. Apparently David Mamet was the script doctor on this film, and it ended up OK. I am of two minds on Mamet, having liked ""The Untouchables"" a lot, and disliked ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" and loathed ""Oleanna"". I also liked Natascha McElhone, who I had never heard of. She is a beautiful and accomplished actress. Some people complained about her brogue. OK, she's not Meryl Streep. But then again, who is? A lot of actors won't even try. I look forward to seeing more of her.Oh, yeah, and some of the car chases were really, really cool, almost McQueenian."
Shame,2011,7.2,A nymphomaniac's carefully cultivated private life falls apart after his sister arrives for an indefinite stay.,"This film instantly drew me in. Fassbender's performance is complex and truly believable.I can honestly say that if you are not haunted by the torment of both Michael Fassbender's and Carey Mulligan's performance, then you are in denial. The pain is apparent, the intrigue of what happened to these siblings is staring you in the face throughout the film. The role's Fassbender has chosen lately have made me an ultimate fan! Another McQueen movie, HUNGER, also stars Fassbender as an Irishman in political protest against the corrupt government of the ""80's. I tremendously enjoy watching him on the screen. Michael Fassbender relays raw emotion and true passion to create believable and relatable characters. Im looking forward to future projects."
Be Cool,2005,5.6,"Disenchanted with the movie industry, Chili Palmer tries the music industry, meeting and romancing a widow of a music executive on the way.","The sequel to Get Shory has Chili Palmer taking on the music business. Its not as good as the first film, but if taken on its own is a good time passer.The problem here is two fold. First the film has a running gag about hating sequels, which would be fine if it was just a joke and didn't extend to the film making. Few of the actors in this film seem to be doing more than walking through the film for the cash or as a joke and it shows. The second problem is that there is way way too much going on and way too many people doing it. It seems to me that every time that someone of note shows up the movie has to stop to give them their couple of minutes on screen. Usually the material is decent, but it slows the pace down. I kept wanting to speed things up.That said I did like the film, but regret having paid movie theater prices to do so. This is a rental, not something you pay ten bucks to see. If you get the chance to rent it or see it on cable give it a shot. Just don't expect an equal to Get Shorty."
Smoke,1995,7.4,"A Brooklyn smoke shop is the center of neighborhood activity, and the stories of its customers.","I cannot begin to convey the intellectual and spiritual riches of this exquisite, almost transcendental film. I have rarely seen a motion picture with better acting or a more literate, insightful script.Harvey Keitel, John Hurt, Stockard Channing, Ashley Judd, Forrest Whittaker, and all the other players  contribute some of their finest performances.The film itself ends with a ""Christmas story' which conveys more of the religious-and humanist-meaning of that holiday than a thousand scmaltzy TV specials.Watch this movie, watch it carefully. Rarely has the beauty and sublimity concealed behind the facade of quotidian existence been better conveyed in a film."
Time After Time,1979,7.0,H.G. Wells pursues Jack the Ripper to the 20th Century when the serial murderer uses the future writer's time machine to escape his time period.,"""Time after Time"" is a clever battle of wits between Jack the Ripper, who has used H.G. Wells' time machine to escape to the year 1979, and H.G. Wells, who steps into the machine to get to 1979 too, and chase after the Ripper.  (This kind of brain-to-brain combat between two very special people is a theme that Nicholas Meyer will return to in ""Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan."")Particularly interesting is how Jack the Ripper, an evil serial killer, finds himself completely at home in the year 1979, while H.G. Wells, with his idealistic dreams of a perfectible society, is completely out of place in our modern era.Malcolm McDowell is believable yet comical as the intellectual Wells, almost bird-like in his quick, darting movements.  David Warner is adequate as Jack the Ripper, but you don't get enough of a feeling of the Ripper's insanity and evil.  Mary Steenburgen, as Wells' newfound love interest in 1979, acts well enough, but she delivers some of her lines unconvincingly.The lush Miklos Rosza score is a treat.Worth seeing."
Hope Springs,2012,6.3,"After thirty years of marriage, a middle-aged couple attends an intense, week-long counseling session to work on their relationship.","There are movies that come along that fall in numerous genres. The latest Hope Springs seems to be pushing the comedy but sports a story that could easily be delivering the drama so going in is already somewhat of a mystery on what to really expect. With a stellar cast of Meryl Streep, Tommy Lee Jones, and Steve Carell is there any way this film couldn't work on some level?Hope Springs follows a married couple who have grown apart. They head out to Hope Springs to attempt to rekindle their lost spark, but with a skeptical husband reluctant to take on the treatment is there any chance of saving this marriage? This is one of those movies that actually hit the mark successfully being both a comedy and a drama. When it's funny it hit a lot of really funny, sometimes uncomfortable funny moments. These are not a bad thing, but more uncomfortable for the characters in the situation thus causing a bit for the audience. What makes this film go from something pretty average to deliver something a bit more is the cast. Jones and Streep have both great chemistry throughout the film and feel like a real couple during the problem times as well as the emotional affection ones. This is their movie to shine and the emotional roller coaster they both deliver really makes this film work. They bounce around from typical married couple to acting like teenagers in love like only someone with their talent could do. Carell does a great job playing the straight laced doctor, but really only serves as a buffer to help this story of these too move along. This does showcase another chance to show he is more than just a funny man, but just doesn't bring a whole lot to the film, but what he does works well. The story isn't anything all that new, but will easily affect any age couple in a relationship that have experienced something like this from the emotional moments to the comedic ones.This is a memorable cute heartfelt movie that is usually saved for the younger cast, but gives it this new twist using the older couple. Jones and Streep show that they still have it in both the acting chops and the love story delivering some unexpected sexual humor that elevated this movie just out of average and into a fun worthwhile cute film.http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey"
London,2005,6.3,"At a drug laden party in a New York loft, a young man tries to win back his ex-girlfriend.","Directed by newcomer Hunter Richards, London is a complex tale of a man scorned by a traumatic breakup. Jessica Biel plays the title character, a savvy sophisticated woman who was the love of Syd's (Chris Evans) life. Since she left him, he has become a complete wreck. He now spends his days drinking and snorting cocaine. Six months later, he finds out through a random phone call that London is moving to Los Angeles. The worst part is that her friend Becca (Isla Fisher) is throwing a going away party - one that he isn't invited to. Determined to get London back, Syd decides to crash the party along with his unsuspecting dealer Bateman (Jason Statham), a banker who sells drugs on the side. When they get there, they eventually wind up in the bathroom. They snort huge amounts of coke and talk about life and love as Syd attempts to get up his nerve and talk to London. Along the way we are introduced to a number of eccentric characters, such as feisty bartender Mallory (Joy Bryant) and high-school student Maya (Kelli Garner). Each one plays a part in Syd's tripped-out journey of self discovery.Although it features a cast full of popular young stars, London is not an easy sell in the slightest.. Audiences aren't likely to respond due to its strange and offbeat plot. It reminds me a lot of 1999's Go in this regard, although it is considerably less mainstream. It is truly a character study of many different individuals, all of them reflecting on life as the events unfold before their eyes. It moves at a slow pace but is never boring thanks to excellent performances and stylish direction.Chris Evans is on screen for almost every frame and delivers another excellent performance. He shows his dramatic chops here and exhibits an ability for both comedy and drama. His character is very complex and has many different layers, all of which are revealed throughout the course of the film. Jason Statham, well-known for his action roles, plays against type here as the straight laced businessman Bateman. He shows his talent in both comedy and drama, and also has great chemistry with Evans. Jessica Biel is radiant and fascinating as London, a woman longing for complete commitment in an otherwise stable relationship. She has strong chemistry with real-life boyfriend Evans and her character is believable and likable. Most of her scenes are flashback sequences, so it is interesting to watch her character progress.The supporting cast is great for a film of this size. Joy Bryant is solid as Mallory and gets the most to do of the side characters. Kelli Garner makes an impression but isn't given a whole lot to do, maybe appearing for fifteen minutes total. Isla Fisher, who was hilarious in last year's Wedding Crashers, gives another strong comedic performance here as the naive and unsuspecting party host. The rest of the actors are fairly insignificant overall, with most being reduced to mere walk-on roles (such as comedian Dane Cook).Richards writes and directs this project and shows great promise in his first outing. The direction is stylish and he finds many interesting takes to use - making the film easy to watch and helping it from dragging on. The screenplay is also solid. It seems like something originally written for the stage, but it works on film thanks to the way each scene is handled. While there are comedic elements, there are also several sweet and poignant scenes. The best scene in the film is the final confrontation between London and Syd in an airport. The Crystal Method provides the score for the film, a techno-fringed mixture of various beats that fits well with the tone of the film.Overall, I can see why London isn't appreciated by critics and won't be embraced by audiences. It's a strange film that requires patience from the viewer due to its slow pace. But thanks to excellent performances and stylish direction, it turns out to be a completely fascinating and involving tale.8/10 (B+)"
Limitless,2011,7.4,"A mysterious pill that enables the user to access 100% of his brain's abilities transforms a struggling writer into a financial wizard, but it also puts him in a new world with many dangers.","I feel it needs to be said that this is a superhero movie. We've had a myriad of superhero movies in recent years, but only a handful (e.g. the first Iron Man) were films where it seemed to me cast and crew were not fast asleep but actually cared about what they were doing. This is definitely an example of that rare breed. It is one of those movies where you spend the entire length of the film NOT noticing that it is a superhero movie, and quite possibly this will not dawn on you even on the ride home, because the subject matter is handled seriously: the characters are 3d life-like people; the plot has life-like complexity; there is ambiguity and room for interpretation. Somebody cared. I had my doubts, going in, whether Bradley Cooper can pull this one off. He sure can. Other actors are also at the top of their game. (I don't feel I need to pick out De Niro in particular, here.)So, the good: Original, creative writing. Original, creative, beautiful cinematography. Original, creative direction. Interesting throughout. Believable, except when it isn't trying to be. Good pacing. Well acted.The bad: Some scenes stretch credulity. Most by just a little. The fore-last scene is over the top. I loved it. (My wife said: ""They're trying to pull a Tarrantino. Right?"" and they were.) I can't blame anyone who says this scene ruined the movie for him. It isn't believable. It isn't consistent with the rest. But it's definitely where the roller-coaster that is this movie is at its most extreme. By contrast, the last scene left me with a feeling of something missed. It's like the script saves the best for the sequel.So, unfortunately, this movie doesn't have an ending that makes you forgive it for everything else. Quite on the contrary. It just happens to be so good that I was willing to forgive it its bad ending."
Transporter 2,2005,6.3,"Transporter Frank Martin, surfaces in Miami, Florida and is implicated in the kidnapping of the young son of a powerful USA official.","Just an all around fun romp at the movies. No new or complicated story here. We just get more of Frank kicking some serious tail. Implausible action sequences are forgiven with the wink of an eye from the director and actors. Some of the fastest action you will see that doesn't rely on wire-fu or CGI. Rather, we get a lot of the same from Frank and that is exactly what should be expected. I think in the modern era of the high concept action movies, they have forgotten how to just show the audience a good time. This movie and it's predecessor take us back to a time when action wasn't bogged down by complicated stories, rather the star's charisma and action were all that one needed to enjoy their time in the theater.These movies have no lofty aspirations other than to give you one hell of a ride for an hour and a half. This outing delivers in spades."
The Ugly Truth,2009,6.4,An uptight television producer takes control of a morning show segment on modern relationships hosted by a misogynistic man.,"Abby (Katherine Heigl) is an intelligent producer of a local morning show in Sacramento, California. She lives with her cat in a beautiful, lushly-gardened apartment complex but, the lovely lady longs to meet Mr. Right. One day, bad news arrives, twofold. One, since the show's ratings have slipped, the owners of the station have decided to go in a new direction. And, two, that direction would be south, Abby believes, for they have hired a brash, I-don't-mince-words talk show host, Mike (Gerard Butler) for a reprise of his late-night call-in program, The Ugly Truth. Mike will do small segments of advice, where he will counsel women on what a man ""really wants"". Since Abby has a past with this gentleman (she had recently called the late night show to tell Mike to take a hike) the young producer is mighty peeved that he has been hired for ""her"" program. Instant dislike reigns supreme. However, Mike does seem to know about affairs of the heart, even in his twisted fashion, and starts to give advice to Abby, on how to ""catch"" the very handsome young doctor, Colin (Eric Winter) who has just moved into her complex. two doors down. But, since this requires Abby and Mike to actually converse and confide in one another, could it be that Cupid's arrows could go astray? This is a very raucous and funny romcom but. it is definitely not in the Doris Day tradition. Therefore, if you are easily offended or prefer ""sweet"" tales of love, with just a touch of spice, this one may not be for you. That said, the cast is really delightful, for Heigl and Butler make a most attractive. sparring duo and Winter turns heads with his looks and smiles. The supporting cast, with Cheryl Hines and the rest, is quite nice, too. Also, the Sacramento setting is lovely while the costumes are terrific and the production values high. As for the direction, it is full of energy and mischief, as befits a script that is clever but rather risqu√©. All in all, if you love romcoms or any of the stars, you will probably embrace this one with gusto. For the truth is, it is very romantic at its core, and that's the best ingredient a comedic love tale can possess."
Panic Room,2002,6.8,"A divorced woman and her diabetic daughter take refuge in their newly-purchased house's safe room when three men break-in, searching for a missing fortune.",This was a very suspenseful and exciting thriller from David Fincher who is responsible for my all time favourite film which is Seven. This new film has another very good performance by Jodie Foster but the acting standout of the film has to go to Dwight Yoakam with awesome performance as Raoul. The only problem i had with this film was its ending which was a bit of a let down but did not really spoil the film at all.8 out of 10
What Happens in Vegas,2008,6.1,"A man and a woman are compelled, for legal reasons, to live life as a couple for a limited period of time. At stake is a large amount of money.","When I first saw the trailer to What Happens in Vegas..., I thought it did look so predictable, but it had some really funny moments in the trailer, so I still wanted to see it. The only sad part, we have Cameron Diaz(who looks like a really good looking aging woman) and Ashton Kutcher(who still looks and acts like he's 12 years old), so we have two obnoxious actors that could have made a very disastrous film. But I saw What Happens in Vegas... yesterday and even though it was very predictable and stupid, it still had some very funny moments. I mean, Cameron and Ashton play two of the most unlikeable characters in movie history, who just bicker back and forth. The characters who win you over in the film are Rob Corddry and Lake Bell, who's fighting is actually very funny. But Aston and Cameron had some really good moments too.Joy just got dumped by her boyfriend in front of her friends, Jack just got fired by his own father, so what's next for them? VEGAS! They happen to meet when their rooms get mixed up and end up drinking together, having a ball in Vegas, and end up accidentally marrying each other. When they come too, they realize it was a mistake, but start bickering, Joy leaves a quarter at her slot machine and Jack puts it in and wins 3 million dollars! But when it comes to the annulment, for some strange and unbelievable reason, the judge sentences them to 6 months hard marriage and freezes the money. So these two who have nothing in common battle it out, until of course they fall for each other.What Happens in Vegas... is silly and predictable, but I do think the rating her on IMDb is a little harsh. I completely side with people who hate Cameron and Ashton, but their battle scenes together are pretty funny. Just I've seen so many worse films, this was just a fun romantic comedy to lighten the spirit of Iron Man and Speed Racer, not to mention the more action packed movies for the summer. So I'd say it's worth the look, but more of a rental vs. a high priced ticket, but just have fun, I think you'll get more than a few laughs.5/10"
Now You See Me,2013,7.2,"An FBI agent and an Interpol detective track a team of illusionists who pull off bank heists during their performances, and reward their audiences with the money.","There are a lot of reviews already for this movie, so it is unlikely anyone will read mine. But I feel like I have to weigh in on this movie.This is the most fun I've had watching a flick in a very, very long time. This movie is a riot! It isn't quite as clever as it thinks it is. Most of the surprises weren't terribly surprising; off the top of my head I can identify at least three that I saw coming. But I don't care.It was fun! It was funny and engaging and I found myself simultaneously rooting for both sides. There is no shortage of action, the dialogue is peppy, and - unlike almost everything else I've watched lately - it's never boring.Do yourself a favor and don't analyze. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. Movies don't have to be life-altering."
The Pursuit of Happyness,2006,8.0,A struggling salesman takes custody of his son as he's poised to begin a life-changing professional career.,"In this journey through the struggles and trials that single father, Chris Gardner, has to take, you see the real side of hardwork and integrity. Chris Gardner, played by Will Smith, Is just trying to give his son a good home as he's on the pursuit of happiness. This movie doesn't only show the hard work of a single parent, but it shows that no matter how hard you get pushed down, you should always get up and keep going. I love the strong connection that the father and son roles have in this movie, it seems so real, and that's because it is! The father (Will smith) and son (Jaden Smith) are father and son outside the movie realm too. Actor, Will Smith, shows his true emotional side during this film, as if he was actually going through the situations occurring in the movie. There couldn't have been a better cast picked for this movie, the pain, struggle, love, and hope seem so real as if you're watching a documentary on someone's life. Smith, usually looked at as a comedic actor, shows what he can really do by jerking the tears from the audience's eyes."
First Knight,1995,6.0,"Lancelot falls in love with Guinevere, who is due to be married to King Arthur. Meanwhile, a violent warlord tries to seize power from Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table.","Richard Gere should play detectives or cowboys but not Knights.This is the worst King Arthur movie i have seen in my life.He really is too American and besides the whole story is just bad.Before and after have been much better movies telling movies about King Arthur,Beides there should be less of an age gap between King Arthur and Lancelot.This movie is like a meal at McDonalds it feeds you but its not a good meal."
The Kite Runner,2007,7.6,"Amir lives in California with his wife Soraya. He receives a call from his uncle Rahim Khan who urges him to travel to Afghanistan and rescue the son of Amir's childhood servant and friend, Hassan.","I know that to include everything in the book, the film would have to have been several hours long, so I think they did their best to include things that were crucial and pivotal to the story. I thought the casting was great, the children who played Amir and Hassan were very good actors. And the guy who played Amir as an adult was great! The scenes between him and Baba were especially touching. I thought the locations they used were interesting... scenes set in Afghanistan were shot in China, and one scene that took place in Fremont, CA (the graduation scene) was actually shot on Treasure Island in San Francisco. I worked one day as an extra on ""Kite Runner"" and it was that day, the day they shot the graduation scene. We reported to Treasure Island in the morning, they checked everyone's wardrobe to make sure it looked like the late 80s, an then we took our places in the audience. They shot the scene over and over again until they were happy with it. It was cool to see the actors up close and also to see the book's author, who was on hand as a story consultant. I thought this book was excellent and I recommend both the book and the movie to anyone. This is a moving story about friendship, love, guilt and eventual redemption. ""There is a way to be good again."""
Grown Ups 2,2013,5.4,"After moving his family back to his hometown to be with his friends and their kids, Lenny finds out that between old bullies, new bullies, schizo bus drivers, drunk cops on skis, and four hundred costumed party crashers sometimes crazy follows you.","To make it simple, Grown-Ups 2 felt like the first, if you enjoyed the first one you will probably enjoy this. I would consider it a mediocre movie if it had of been released in the 90's, but Sandler's movies are becoming extremely repetitive, and I think people are beginning to get fed up with Adam Sandler if they weren't already, I think it is time he gives it a rest. Grown-Ups 2 has some jokes that made me crack a smile, or chuckle, but has absolutely no plot, it's like watching a mash-up of jokes play out in front of you, rather then watching a movie thats funny. Not worth watching in theatres, rent or watch it online. Hopefully this will be Sandler's last movie for a while, and this is coming from a person who enjoys some of his movies."
The Wave,2008,7.6,A high school teacher's experiment to demonstrate to his students what life is like under a dictatorship spins horribly out of control when he forms a social unit with a life of its own.,"This is my fourth German film and I'm digging them. Because you asked, I watched ""Das Boot,"" ""Downfall,"" and ""Run Lola Run.""I thought ""The Wave"" was going to be corny. I thought it was going to be about a group of simple-minded kids following a leader because of some bromides. It wasn't that at all.Rainer Wenger (Jurgen Vogel) was a teacher who was teaching a class on autocracy for project week. After a spit-fire discussion with the class about what autocracy is Mr. Wenger decided to do an experiment with the class. For project week only they would have to do what Mr. Wenger said. There were a few that resisted and left the class, but those who remained were all in. Slowly, we saw the evolution of a movement.""The Wave"" is the negative side of populism. I say that because the Wave, meaning the organization they formed, could easily have been something good. Mr. Wenger had his students doing very constructive and positive stuff. Who doesn't believe that there's strength in unity, who doesn't believe in equality, who doesn't believe in helping their fellow man? Plenty of organizations, religions, and movements purport similar beliefs and they are viewed as being good. It's when people use these goodly aims to form radical armies bent on purging, ""cleansing,"" or otherwise harming those who don't think like them, that makes a movement into a gang. And if the movement is large enough to engulf an entire nation it becomes an autocracy.""The Wave"" gives food for thought. I think the larger lesson wasn't about being a part of something, I think it was about extremism. That very same group with more moderate participants could easily have been an asset to their school and their community. So I don't knock the Wave for its extremists anymore than I knock a religion for its extremists. Don't throw the baby out with the bath water."
American Reunion,2012,6.7,"Jim, Michelle, Stifler, and their friends reunite in East Great Falls, Michigan for their high school reunion.","American Reunion completes the transition into adulthood for these characters in a typically sincere fashion. It feels ahead of its time by being a legacy sequel long before it became one of Hollywood's main vices and sacrifices none of the laughs whilst still being able to let everyone accept that it's time to move on from trying to recreate the highs of high school.It's really nice to have the main five back together and whilst Chris Klein is probably the least funny, his reintroduction brings so much heart and that's always been this franchise's greatest strength. Seann William Scott essentially repeats his arc from the last one to even greater success and Eugene Levy getting more screen time than ever is an adorable gift.Directors Jon Hurwitz & Hayden Schlossberg continue what Jesse Dylan started by giving this one quite a bit of energy with their pretty dynamic direction. There's some well placed callbacks here and some of these jokes leave a huge lasting impression. As is always the case, the soundtrack here is a real highlight as it bookends the film rather than being a constant presence."
Analyze This,1999,6.7,A comedy about a psychiatrist whose number-one patient is an insecure mob boss.,"I enjoyed this much more than I expected to.  DeNiro hasn't had a part this good in years, and he plays it to the hilt.  It will remind you why you liked him in the first place.  Billy Crystal is just as good, but it DeNiro's movie all the way.  Your life will not be changed by watching this, but you will enjoy it."
K-PAX,2001,7.4,"PROT is a patient at a mental hospital who claims to be from a faraway planet named K-PAX. His psychiatrist tries to help him, only to begin to doubt his own explanations.","This film IS brilliant...... without a doubt. Watched it a while ago after constant pestering from family members who are right into their sci-fi films (which I am not), and thought it was quite good. But after recently watching a few documentaries on outer-space etc we watched it again... and it IS good.Kevin Spacey is without doubt one of the greatest actors ever and I really like Jeff Bridges (Big Lewbowski, Blown Away, Arlington Road). The film revolves around a patient in a nursing home who claims he is from another planet. Yeah right, you think... but what if his story is so believable that even his psychiatrist begins to wonder if he is telling the truth.That is how the story evolves with Bridges going through all kinds of emotions dealing with Prot (as he is known), his own psychiatric colleagues, his wife and family, his brother-in-law and his cosmologist astronomer work colleagues (who after getting some data from Prot, pretty much admit that he might be telling the truth!) A great film... that get's you wondering.....8/10 Dave"
King Kong,2005,7.2,"A greedy film producer assembles a team of moviemakers and sets out for the infamous Skull Island, where they find more than just cannibalistic natives.","I agree, some scenes maybe are a bit too long. But what do you expect from a 3 hour movie? That it is short?You know how the duration before you start watching.I was thinking give it an eight or a nine. I chose nine. Because overall this still is a great adventure movie for sure.The more recent Kong: Skull Island is a fun watch as well, but more like a fast paced action movie of it's time.This Peter Jackson version has it's fair amount of action and still pretty good effects and tells a better and more complete story."
Hulk,2003,5.7,"Bruce Banner, a genetics researcher with a tragic past, suffers a lab accident that makes him transform into a raging, giant green monster when angered, making him a target of forces seeking to abuse his power.","I finally caught up with the film on DVD, after missing its cinema release and just not having the urge to see it until now. It has had some rather bad press, so I wasn't actually expecting very much.One of the reasons I have waited so long was to let my son, (who is now eight) grow up a bit before seeing it. He was interested in the tie-in products filling the shelves in all the stores on release. A blanket-marketing ploy that is becoming more and more hysterical, I fear.Another was that I was wary of renting it as the Hulk character has been rather mal-treated in live-action form.Until Ang Lee's film.Firstly, this isn't by any stretch of the imagination, a kids' film. Though my younger children watched it, it gave them serious food for thought about what scientists do to animals and people in the name of science. My oldest was enthralled. She appreciated Lee's magnificent use of the film medium.This is a very dark movie. The origin-story has been manipulated and updated linking the two lead characters (Bana and Connelly) in a sorrowful, fearful event that happened to them both in their childhood. Nice touch.""Banner's"" (Eric Bana's) father (played by Nick Nolte) shuffles back into his life after 30 years incarceration for causing the events that had traumatized the young Banner. Banner later finds that his father had ""experimented"" on him when they were still a whole family. This creepy device effectively modernizes the story and it's ultimate revelation is a clever way of releasing the pent-up rage that Banner jr has locked within his mind. This rage feeds the Hulk. Banner finally becomes the Hulk after some incredible bravery in the lab.The film's effects are superb. I am a very happy viewer. This is great cinema. A wonderful adaptation of a tortured, misunderstood human being.Highly recommended, by me, for true Hulk fans."
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,1982,7.9,A troubled child summons the courage to help a friendly alien escape from Earth and return to his home planet.,"The classic of family classics, 'E.T.' is a wonderful and heartfelt portrait of childhood exploring the friendship between Elliot, a young boy living in California, and an extra-terrestrial who gets accidentally left behind by his spaceship. From the multiple viewings during my childhood to the nostalgic sense of warmth I get from watching it nowadays, there is no way I can fault this science fiction masterpiece. One of Spielberg's greatest films, 'E.T.' is a compassionate and emotionally-driven tale packed with clever storytelling, bold direction and state-of-the-art visual effects.. oh and it also features one of the most iconic images in cinema history. A remarkable adventure that acts as both a touching family drama and an exciting sci-fi flick, and one that needs to be seen by all."
The Peacemaker,1997,6.0,A US Army colonel and a civilian woman supervising him must track down stolen Russian nuclear weapons before they're used by terrorists.,"A US Army colonel (George Clooney) and a civilian woman (Nicole Kidman) supervising him must track down stolen Russian nuclear weapons before they are used by terrorists.My biggest problem with this film is that it seemed to me to be miscast. George Clooney is pretty good, and he plays the smarmy role he is great at doing (the modern day Cary Grant). Nicole Kidman seems off, though. The role never seems to fit her, and there never seems to be a clear understanding of who she is: bumbling, nervous librarian? Or assertive world-class diplomat? Not surprisingly, the movie has sort of faded into obscurity, and will probably continue to do so as time goes on."
50 First Dates,2004,6.8,Henry Roth is a man afraid of commitment until he meets the beautiful Lucy. They hit it off and Henry think he's finally found the girl of his dreams until discovering she has short-term memory loss and forgets him the next day.,"The basic storyline of 50 First Dates: Henry Roth lives in Hawaii and spend his time wooing women who are visiting the island, simply because there is little chance of commitment. Then he meets Lucy Whitmore. One day they hit it off, and the next she doesn't even recognise him. It turns out that she suffers from short-term memory loss, and every day he tries to win her over once more. Firstly, I have to say that 50 First Dates is a really funny film. It isn't overly stupid, but it's not subtle either. But underneath the humour is where I believe this film's true beauty lies. It shows love in a way that I have never seen in another film before. From the way that her family sacrifices everything to keep her happy, and blissfully unaware of her condition, to Henry who, despite the fact that he could have just about any woman that he wanted, decides that he wants to be with Lucy, regardless of the fact that he has to meet her for the first time every day. Henry's character undergoes somewhat of a transformation in front of our eyes. The film starts off with him coming across as somewhat of a pig (well, to us women anyway :)), and by the end of the film, we truly admire him. He even sacrifices his dream so that he can be with Lucy, and help her to move on with her life. The film isn't really predictable, either. For example, I spent the entire films assuming that the ending would be somewhat different. Although romcoms almost always have happy endings, this one damn near had me in tears. And it wasn't even sad. I never knew what a feel-good film was until I saw this...highly recommended."
Vicky Cristina Barcelona,2008,7.1,"Two friends on a summer holiday in Spain become enamored with the same painter, unaware that his ex-wife, with whom he has a tempestuous relationship, is about to re-enter the picture.","On vacation in Spain two American girlfriends meet a tall, dark and handsome artist who satisfies their needs in unexpected ways.A curious little romance that putters along until about the halfway mark, when the introduction of a new character adds some tension and darkness. The sensibility is middle class - safe and responsible - so nothing really dramatic is promised and the story resolves on a minor note: not too comfortable, restrained in emotion.The performances are good, particularly from the ex-wife. Locations are idyllic. Music is gorgeous. Only complaint is the odd voice-over of the narrator, which lords it over the story and is very much tell-don't-show.Overall: fairly interesting, fairly engaging."
Meet the Fockers,2004,6.4,All hell breaks loose when the Byrnes family meets the Focker family for the first time.,"Meet the Fockers is not quite as good as its predecessor, but it is still very enjoyable with some brilliant cast additions that make for great comedy.Everything that was brilliant about the style of Meet the Parents is replicated in this sequel to great effect. Ben Stiller and De Niro are on fine form as expected, and the addition of Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand is inspired. They were so fantastic and their characters so well written.The plot is fun, although it feels slightly less fresh than Meet the Parent. This is my only real criticism. Some plot elements felt a bit repetitive of the first film. I mean there's only so much that can go wrong for this poor guy right?Overall a very solid and enjoyable comedy sequel. A worthy successor to Meet the Parents."
Lethal Weapon 4,1998,6.6,"With personal crises and age weighing in on them, LAPD officers Riggs and Murtaugh must contend with deadly Chinese triads that are trying to free their former leaders out of prison and onto American soil.","Lethal Weapon 4 starts out with a boring and ridiculous beginning. I remember watching it the first time and thinking, ""oh no, another bad sequel.""However, once past the first ten minutes, the film starts to pick up its pace and retreat into familiar Lethal Weapon style.Just like film 2 and 3, Lethal Weapon 4 isn't as good as the original, but it never gets to the point of unbearable. It is quite entertaining and fun to watch, with some very great actors, that have some very great chemistry between each other.Mel Gibson and Danny Glover fit like a glove, and Joe Pesci is perfect as the comedy relief, not being like the recent ""side kicks"" we always see, that are so obnoxious we want to punch them. Mr. Pesci is a very talented actor, and he always makes me laugh, whether it's Lethal Weapon 4 or Raging Bull and Casino.Rene Russo provides Mel's love interest yet again, and though I found the marriage thing a bit of a throw-in, it was still good for the story. It provided some laughs at the end of the film.Chris Rock stars in one role where his character is not completely annoying or loudmouthed, mainly because he wasn't extremely famous yet, and had only been on SNL and a few small roles in film... Joes Pesci and him throw back and forth a few insults and jokes, and bounce off each other, which helps me welcom Rock a bit more.Jet Li's first American film, I believe, proves he can be a quite and intriguing character, which later helped him get roles in films like Kiss of the Dragon and The One.Another thing about this franchise is that director Richard Donner directed all four films, and it's always good to use the original director for a sequel, rather than a lesser director, as we have countless examples of. (especially horror films!)From the opening jazz music we have come to love, Lethal Weapon provides enough entertainment and fun to keep one entertained, and it's definitely worth watching. I hope they stop while they're ahead, and do not make another Lethal Weapon film, because it's rare for a film series to still be entertaining and imaginative after these many sequels. 3/5 stars-"
No Reservations,2007,6.3,The life of a top chef changes when she becomes the guardian of her young niece.,"Very likable even for a formula romcom, mainly because of the terrific casting and performances of the actors.The forever beautiful and talented Catherine Zeta-Jones (Chicago, The Mask of Zorro) is spot on as Kate, a workaholic chef at hoity toity 22 Bleeker. Kate unexpectedly inherits her niece Zoe, played tremendously well by Abigail Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine). Real-life motherhood must have enabled Zeta-Jones to show her softer side with the restraint her character called for.Aaron Eckhart (Thank You for Smoking, Black Dahlia) is Nick, the Italian-trained, opera-singing, charismatic new chef who invades Kate's precision-perfect French kitchen. Nick is Kate's quintessential opposite and eventually helps her sort out her trust issues and even enhances her parenting skills.It is refreshing to see CZJ back on the silver screen where she belongs, and playing a non-glamorous character for once, even sans makeup in some scenes. At 38 years old, that is a brave feat indeed (and this courage is consistent with all the flawed characters she likes to play).Her on screen chemistry with Eckhart is positively sizzling, and his cockiness to her coolness effectively makes you forget about the trite plot. While Zeta-Jones has also been criticized for being too beautiful for the role of a lonely chef, that is actually one of the ironies of life that this movie uncovers: beauty and talent doesn't really guarantee bliss.Despite the awful MTV-like montage of the trio grocery shopping and the rest of the unspectacular elements, overall, the movie makes you feel for the characters. You leave the cinema all warm and fuzzy, and that makes the execution of No Reservations a success."
Milk,2008,7.5,"The story of American gay activist Harvey Milk, who fought for gay rights and was elected as California's first openly gay official.","Gus Van Sant's talent and humility allows Harvey Milk to be a the center of this remarkable story without putting himself in front of the camera. Sean Penn shines with a new and extraordinary light as Harvey Milk. His humanity is overwhelming at times. That permanent smile defining his face talks volumes about his faith in people, no matter what. His awareness is filled with truth and innocence, he worries he's about to be 40 and hasn't accomplished anything. Little did he know.The film is constructed brilliantly in a series of vignettes that builds up into a whole fluid narrative. Josh Brolin, as the disturbed Dan White is another standout in a complex and remarkable performance. No cheap shots here. Diego Luna, Joseph Cross and Emile Hirsch are also terrific as the boys around Harvey but it is James Franco who truly gets under your skin. His romantic turn is one of the most compelling gay love stories I've ever seen (and I've seen Brokeback Mountain). Highly recommended!"
The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,2010,6.3,"Lucy and Edmund Pevensie return to Narnia with their cousin Eustace where they meet up with Prince Caspian for a trip across the sea aboard the royal ship The Dawn Treader. Along the way they encounter dragons, dwarves, merfolk, and a band of lost warriors before reaching the edge of the world.","I was SO looking forward to the Voyage of the Dawn Treader, and was sorely disappointed.The film felt like they took the original story, chopped it up, then threw it in a blender with seven magical swords and some ridiculous green mist!While the film stayed true to main themes of the story, much of the character development and purpose to each of the minor island stories was lost. Unfortunately this meant that most of the magic of the story was lost as well.I gave the film 6 stars due to the redeeming qualities that were the stunning visuals, some excellent acting (notably by Will Poulter as Eustace), and a beautifully executed final scene.If you haven't read the book, then you may enjoy this film immensely, but if you are a true Narnia fan, don't go in with very high expectations."
Team America: World Police,2004,7.2,"Popular Broadway actor Gary Johnston is recruited by the elite counter-terrorism organization Team America: World Police. As the world begins to crumble around him, he must battle with terrorists, celebrities and falling in love.","I'm sure plenty of parochial critics will berate this film for anti-American values during the current ""war on terror""....BUT...the great thing about this film is that no one is spared being mocked. This bears the standard of a great film by expressing the ironies innate in every argument in this quasi-political tale; from socialist Michael Moore, fashionably charitable celebrities to the terrorists and the, ahem ""world police."" This couldn't be more accurately summed up than in one of the funniest ever analogies that is employed in this film; the ""Dic*s, P*ssies, and a*s*holes, argument."" This film also wonderfully parodies the standard conventions and clich√©'s of the action film genre to create an entertaining, and gleefully controversial film."
The Rum Diary,2011,6.1,American journalist Paul Kemp takes on a freelance job in Puerto Rico for a local newspaper during the 1960s and struggles to find a balance between island culture and the expatriates who live there.,"Plot Summary Now if your the sort of person that needs a definitive story line and thick plot to enjoy a film then this probably isn't for you. Its more a 'fly on the wall' view of a young journalists struggles in a failing newspaper. Paul Kemp(Depp) is a young man trying to make his way in a new place, making new friends and enemy's along the way.What I thought of it I wasn't sure what I would think of this film, I new it has some great actors, such as Johnny Depp and Giovanni Ribisi, but the concept of the film was a strange one. I was pleasantly surprised, the director Bruce Robinson has done a great job with this film, which was always going to be a very tough job being adapted from a novel by Hunter S Thompson and technically having next to no strong plot.The film itself is stunning, the locations are amazing and well shot, and the editing style and shots work brilliantly with the type of film and more importantly with Johnny Depp, who has a massive screen presence in everything he does, including 'The Rum Diary'.This film has everything I want to see in a good movie, strong characters, great sets and brilliant comedy, along with meaning. It really makes you think about society and life nowadays and how primarily, nothing has changed in the way the world goes round and the sort of corruption and manipulation that still goes on today all around us, as it did back in the fifties, only less obviously.On a lighter note, this film is hilarious and great to watch more than once, there is something rather satisfying about watch a man drink huge amounts of high octane rum and have to deal with the consequences the next morning, something that makes you happy its not only you.Summary In all I thought this was a very enjoyable film for anyone to watch and have a good laugh at while loving everything about the characters. The acting is scintillating and exciting.I highly recommend this film to all, one to watch ..... 7/10 Stars*"
Apocalypse Now,1979,8.4,A U.S. Army officer serving in Vietnam is tasked with assassinating a renegade Special Forces Colonel who sees himself as a god.,"Reviewers say 'Apocalypse Now' is acclaimed for its stunning visuals, strong performances, and deep psychological insights. Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando deliver unforgettable roles. Its depiction of war's chaos and horror is often lauded. Yet, some critics find the script and narrative lacking, with unclear direction and pacing issues. Despite these flaws, it stands as a significant cinematic achievement."
Starsky,2004,6.1,"Two streetwise cops bust criminals in their red and white Ford Gran Torino, with the help of a police snitch called ""Huggy Bear"".","Hand on heart I did not want to watch this film. Although I grew up with the TV series and really enjoyed it, when the film was released I have to say that I was not keen, I can not put my finger on why, perhaps it was Stiller, who, Something About Mary apart, has never really done it for me. But what ever the reason, it remained unveiwed.That was 2004 - Xmas 2006 and I get DVD vouchers, so In the January sales off I go to see what I can get, I do quite well, but have ¬£3 remaining, I have 2 or 3 to chose from 2 I have already seen, and Starsky & Hutch.....So I bought it.......yet still it was unwatched until yesterday.......hungover and feeling a little lazy I needed something to pass the time that was easy to watch, funny, and not too taxing.....so on it goes.How surprised was I then when after only a few minutes I was giggling away. Stiller was actually entertaining and I was enjoying watching him, Mr Wilson was very good and I got the vibe that the characters gelled as the ones in the TV series did. Vaughan was a good baddie, and Snoop was hight entertaining if not as camp Huggy Bear! All in all this is a good solid comedy film, not brilliant don't get me wrong, but worth a watch."
Red,2010,7.0,"When his peaceful life is threatened by a high-tech assassin, former black-ops agent Frank Moses reassembles his old team in a last-ditch effort to survive and uncover the assailants.","When I first saw the trailer for The Expendables, I was already thinking of the interesting and funny relationship between the characters played by those action icons. After a zillion trailers and a movie, I was sourly disappointed. Now, I don't know who's fault it is, but relative to The Expandables, I almost haven't heard of Red before its release. However, it was exactly what I was looking for.You have a great team of actors. They are not even action heroes, maybe that did it, but they do a great job. just look at that cast: Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, Brian Cox, Hellen Mirren, Richard Dreyfuss, even Ernest Borgnine! As the young(er) crew, Karl Urban and Mary-Louise Parker are in it and they both play well. But more than that, each character actually has a role. They don't just come in, say a few inconsequential things, then die or are completely forgotten *cough* James Remar *cough*.So it had the ridiculously packed action and at times it looked and sounded like Ocean's Eleven, who cares? The rest was great! Even the fight scenes... not even the bad guys go out in full view firing wildly then getting shot. People actually took cover, helped each other and synchronized their moves. The lines were funny and somewhat complex and all the people on the set were clearly having fun doing what they loved.Bottom line: I don't know, maybe because the director is unseasoned in the ways of Hollywood the movie turned out to be so good. Or maybe it was the cast. Or maybe it was the fun of it. The movie turned out great, with a few screw-ups that I am ready to ignore. The mash-up is Jason Bourne meets The Expendables via, luckily for us, just a pinch of Ocean's Eleven."
The Social Network,2010,7.8,"As Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg creates the social networking site that would become known as Facebook, he is sued by the twins who claimed he stole their idea and by the co-founder who was later squeezed out of the business.","Reviewers say 'The Social Network' delves into greed, betrayal, and social media's impact on relationships. The film is lauded for its sharp dialogue, strong performances, and David Fincher's stylish direction. Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg is particularly acclaimed. However, some find the characters unlikable and the focus on legal battles detracts from character development. The atmospheric score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is highly praised. Overall, it's a thought-provoking, well-crafted film capturing its era."
Twilight,2008,5.3,"When Bella Swan moves to a small town in the Pacific Northwest, she falls in love with Edward Cullen, a mysterious classmate who reveals himself to be a 108-year-old vampire.","Reviewers say 'Twilight' is a divisive film with mixed reactions. Many commend the romantic chemistry between Bella and Edward, the atmospheric setting, and the soundtrack. However, criticisms include subpar acting, especially from Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, and the film's failure to capture the book's essence. The special effects are often deemed inadequate, and the pacing is criticized for being rushed. Some find the characters underdeveloped and the dialogue awkward. Despite these flaws, it has a dedicated fanbase valuing its nostalgic and unique blend of romance and supernatural elements."
X-Men Origins: Wolverine,2009,6.5,"The early years of James Logan, featuring his rivalry with his brother Victor Creed, his service in the special forces team Weapon X, and his experimentation into the metal-lined mutant Wolverine.","Reviewers say 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' is lauded for its action scenes, Hugh Jackman's performance, and Liev Schreiber's compelling portrayal of Sabretooth. Yet, it is criticized for a hurried storyline, shallow character development, and straying from comic book roots. The film's treatment of beloved characters like Deadpool and Gambit disappoints fans. Despite these issues, its visual effects and the dynamic between the lead actors are appreciated, making it a divisive yet entertaining entry in the franchise."
Zorba the Greek,1964,7.6,A reserved English writer travelling to Crete on a matter of business finds his life changed forever when he meets the gregarious Alexis Zorba.,"What an exuberant film - not to be missed! It chronicles sadness and joy so beautifully that one can't help but want to weep, laugh, and dance along. There are four wonderful performances, led by Anthony Quinn, whose enthusiam for life almost leaps from the screen, giving rise to an almost sacrilegious thought: How could Rex Harrison's stuffy, embalmed Professor Henry Higgins have won the Best Actor Oscar over Quinn as Zorba? Lila Kedrova is heartbreaking as Madame Hortense, the dying prostitute with a colorful past. The always-enjoyable Alan Bates, and the striking Irene Papas as the Widow. Like Anna Magnani, Papas was an actress who transcended any language barrier, who didn't need dialogue at all - her face and body said everything she needed to.For the most part the film looks great on DVD, with crisp, clear black-and-white photography. But I have one quibble: the transfer seems to have been made from the same source as the videotape prints in circulation, because there are a couple of instances of obvious post-production looping (possibly for prime-time television broadcasts), changing 'goddam' to 'old damn,' for instance - they even do this in the English subtitles. But read Quinn's lips - there's no mistaking what the original lines were! I'd expected that the original unedited soundtrack would have been restored."
Wedding Crashers,2005,7.0,"John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey, a pair of committed womanizers who sneak into weddings to take advantage of the romantic tinge in the air, find themselves at odds with one another when John meets and falls for Claire Cleary.","John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) are life-long friends who have made a hobby out of lying to get into wedding receptions, where they pick up vulnerable women with even more lies. Their plans to crash the upscale wedding of a high-profile politician (Christopher Walken) go awry when John falls in love with the politician's daughter (Rachel McAdams) and the two guys end up spending the weekend with her family¬Öwho just happen to be completely nuts!Wedding Crashers is easily the funniest film of 2005. It's constantly hilarious and it's not completely immature. The premise is pretty creative and original. The film is not just filled with cheap jokes and toilet humor. There's actually a pretty mature love story to be found here as well. In all honestly, the script isn't that great but the film works really well because of the cast. The actors bring life into their characters and most of them give funny performances. Vince Vaughn is the true star of Wedding Crashers. His over the top performance is very funny. Some people may find him annoying though. Owen Wilson also gives a funny performance. He just wasn't as good as Vince but he holds his own. Together, Vaughn and Wilson have great chemistry and really make their scenes with one another really funny.Rachel McAdams is one of the best young actresses working today. She appeared in three movies in 2005 and this one was the best. Her performance is pretty good and it's so easy to love this girl. Christopher Walken does his usual routine and he gives an okay performance. He isn't as funny as everyone else though. Isla Fisher is also another talented young actress. She comes out of no where and gives a very funny performance. Jane Seymour is underused which is too bad because she's pretty funny. Bradley Cooper was okay, nothing really special though. Not all of the film is perfect. I think the running time is too long. Long comedies rarely work out and while this one does, it could have still been edited. Also, the ending is kind of cheesy which is okay but a little unexpected. Will Ferrell makes a cameo and let's just say that it was not needed. It wasn't completely bad but he seemed to be trying way too hard. I really think that he's just an average comedian and nothing really special. One last thing, the film is pretty funny yet it doesn't have that great of a repeat value, at least for me. In the end, Wedding Crashers is worth checking out. Rating 8/10"
The Naked Gun 2¬Ω: The Smell of Fear,1991,6.9,Lieutenant Frank Drebin discovers that his ex-girlfriend's new beau is involved in a plot to kidnap a scientist who advocates solar energy.,"Reviewers say 'The Naked Gun 2¬Ω: The Smell of Fear' is a hilarious sequel with slapstick comedy, clever puns, and absurd situations. Leslie Nielsen's impeccable comedic timing as Lt. Frank Drebin is highlighted, along with strong performances from Priscilla Presley and George Kennedy. The film addresses environmentalism and political satire, targeting energy policies and political figures. While some find the humor less fresh than the original, it is generally seen as a fun and entertaining follow-up."
Little Fockers,2010,5.5,"Family-patriarch Jack Byrnes wants to appoint a successor. Does his son-in-law, the male nurse Greg Focker, have what it takes?","If it was a movie with intentions of being forever remembered and awarded with Oscars I would rate it 2/10 of course, but knowing it has been made for laughing, then it's a 7. I did laugh quite a bit, but it's not an 8 or 9 because some jokes are not my kind of humor or it's the same jokes as the previous movies in the series (with the last name and so on). Also, the plot is dull, like always, things don't work out for Greg and blah blah.The positive: Some fresh jokes, Good acting, Laughs are guaranteed.The negative: DeNiro while showing great character adaptation, I miss him in more serious movies. Some jokes are old, Same formula.So, to sum it up: Just go see it if you want to laugh, don't expect to be a great movie.PS. Jessica Alba looks great in the movie, but the character is tedious."
Underworld: Evolution,2006,6.7,"Picking up directly from the previous movie, vampire warrior Selene and the half werewolf Michael hunt for clues to reveal the history of their races and the war between them.","This original and gore-soaked vampires film begins in 1202 a.d., eight centuries ago. Unknown to humanity, a blood feud raged between a ruling class of vampires and rebellious legion of werewolves known as Lycans. Legend tells that the war began with two brothers, the immortal sons of Alexander Corvinus(Derek Jacobi). Marcus(Tony Curran) bitten by bat became the blood leader of the vampires. William(Brian Steele) , bitten by wolf became the first and most powerful Lycan. For six centuries Selene(Kate Beckinsale) was a loyal soldier of the vampire clan, but she was betrayed. The war was not as it had seemed. In one night, the lies that had united the kind vampire had been exposed. Kraven, the second-in-command had formed a secret alliance with Lucian, ruler of the werewolf clan to overthrow Viktor(Bill Nighy), vampires leader . But Kraven's lust for power and domination had failed. But Viktor was not the savior they had been led to believe. He has betrayed them all. Soon the hunt would be on for his killer. Selene has but one ally left : Michael(Scott Speedman), the human descendant of Corvinus. Neither vampire nor Lycan, but a hybrid. It's only a matter of time before they're found. Their only hope now is to awaken to Markus , the last remaining Elder and expose the truth, before Kraven tries to murder him while he's still in hibernation. Kraven knows he's match for him awake. Meanwhile, Selene and Michael are going to Tanis's(Steven Mackintosh) fortress for getting information. As the war between vampires and werewolves get more personal and deadly , they decide to launch a full-scale attack on the hideout in order to extinguish the race.This exciting movie displays unstopped action, thrills ride, spectacular fighting, graphic violence, brief nudism with mild sex scene and is pretty entertaining. Packs large amount of guts and gore , there's a huge body count, this one actually knocks off an immense amount, several vampires and werewolves are staked bloodily in the chest, even more impaled with large claws. There's really savage decapitation, plenty of bodies ripped in scraps and half, including some of the most tears ever, that spill lots of blood and numerous get shot up with bullets. Most of vampires, Lycans and humans victims are relegated to being bitten in the throat and neck. Magnificent special and visual effects as well as excellent make-up department. Bone-chilling and atmospheric musical score by Marco Beltrani and colorful and dark cinematography by Simon Duggan . Spectacular production design by Patrick Tatopoulos. He's author of set design and production design of known blockbusters, such as 10.000 BC, Indepencence day, I robot, Resident evil, Pith black among them. The motion picture is well directed by Len Wiseman, Kate Beckinsale's husband . He's also the screenwriter along with Danny McBride and Kevin Grevioux. All participate in the following, a prequel in pre-production, titled 'Rise of the Lycans' directed by Patrick Tatopoulos and with similar actors. Recommended to those who amuse those kind of vampires-werewolves films or those enjoy in general."
Next,2007,6.2,A Las Vegas magician who can see into the future is pursued by FBI agents seeking to use his abilities to prevent a nuclear terrorist attack.,"""Next"" comes from a story written by Philip K. Dick, like many clever film titles in the last thirty years. Once again, he takes a simple idea--an alternate reality, if you will--and creates with it an engaging drama.The film involves a variation on time travel. More correctly, it involves multiple realities/universes. Nicholas Cage plays Chris Johnson aka Frank Cadillac, a small-time Las Vegas magician who makes his real money at the gaming tables. He has a special talent: he can look two minutes into his future to see the outcomes of his various potential actions.This talent has put him in the cross hairs of the FBI and others. The feds (especially the team lead by a special agent played by Julianne Moore) want him to help them thwart the nefarious plans of terrorists. But Chris has suffered enough prodding at the hands of the authorities during his life.The narrative has fun with the idea of multiple realities, often fooling the viewer. Amidst the chase scenes are numerous chances to question the boundaries of the magician's ""powers"". The special effects used to portray his options are enjoyable.The wild card is an attractive young woman named Liz Cooper (Jessica Biels) who enters his consciousness. Chris is drawn to this mysterious woman, especially since her presence seems to alter his abilities.I can't say Nicholas Cage would be my first choice for this role, but he plays it well enough. Jessica Biels is fun to watch and believable. Julianne Moore does a good job of riding the line between hard-nosed agent and considerate person.I feel sure some people will not like the ending. And those who prefer to detect plot holes rather than enjoy the ride may not find much enjoyment at all."
Analyze That,2002,5.9,"Mobster Paul Vitti is released into Dr. Ben Sobol's care, where only more chaos ensues.","As sequels go, this was above average. Which translates into a so-so+ movie. I gave it a 7 out of 10, instead of a 5 or a 6, because there ARE some great laughs in it. Although it pains me to say it, overall, as a movie, ""Analyze That"" was a bit flaccid, a bit pale, and certainly not as good as the original. It seemed tired and faded, somehow--- kind of like the recent ""Men in Black II"" sequel to MIB. However, if you are a Billy Crystal-hitting-old-age fan, and if you are a Robert DiNiro fan (and who isn't???--- and if you are gracious enough to be willing to be entertained for a couple of hours, go see it. You'll probably have a pleasant evening!"
The Holiday,2006,7.0,"Amanda lives in LA and is a movie trailer editor. Iris lives in Surrey and is a journalist. The two decide to swap houses for two weeks at Christmas - both trying to forget their troubled love lives, until love finds them anyways.","Iris Simpkins (Kate Winslet) is a pushover for her ex (Rufus Sewell) and she's blindsided by his engagement. Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz) is tired of her cheating boyfriend (Edward Burns) and leaves her LA life for a few weeks. They use a vacation website to chat up a home exchange. During their vacation, they each fall for their own local guys.It's a double rom-com. Jack Black is trying to be a romantic lead. He and Winslet make an odd couple. She's absolutely charming. He's not himself, and Eli Wallach is better as the lead. Jude Law is a more conventional choice for a leading man. He and Diaz work well together.It's an unabashed chick flick. It does exactly what you expect it to do. It just does it twice. It explains the running time of over 2 hours. It's kinda corny and kinda formulaic, but it has its heart in the right place."
De Spiderwick kronieken,2008,6.5,"Upon moving into the run-down Spiderwick Estate with their mother, twin brothers Jared and Simon Grace, along with their sister Mallory, find themselves pulled into an alternate world full of faeries and other creatures.","This is another of those fantasy films that serves its purpose in that it entertains, no matter what the age. It's not among the elite in its genre, but it is a story that hooks you in by the 20-minute mark and you just go along for the ride, mainly to see how things will turn out.There is good suspense in here, enough to make adults care about what happens, not just kids. There also are some scary scenes that are probably too much for small kids, but fine for teens on up. In all, you get a good mix of horror, comedy, fantasy and drama all rolled into one odd (fantasy) story.Child acting star Freddie Highmore, who seems to get cast in a lot of these fantasies (Charlie And The Chocolate Family,"" ""August Rush,"" ""Arthur And The Invisibles,"" and ""The Golden Compass"") has a dual role in here, playing brothers ""Jared""and ""Simon Grace."" Freddie is a fine actor, so no problem in that department. I hate to hear child actors, using God's name as exclamations, though, but that's not Highmore's doing. The only other annoyance is the frequent shouting with an older sister. However, once the adventure kicks into high gear, the arguing stops as the kids try to solve their major dilemma as a unit.Nick Nolte plays the big villain, ""Mulgarath."" but his role is surprisingly small. It's all those ugly, nasty little creatures who surround the house, who are the ""bad guys."" There are a number of somewhat scary scenes involving them, enough to entertain the post-pre-adolescent crowd.The star of the film isn't Freddie or the actors, or the story.....it's the special-effects, which are very good and a lot of fun to watch, from little beings to monsters to fairies to whatever. I saw this on Blu-Ray and it really looks good. All of it is very colorful and entertaining to view, making this a film fun for both kids and adults."
Hitch,2005,6.6,A smooth-talking man falls for a hardened columnist while helping a shy accountant woo a beautiful heiress.,"I just really enjoyed this movie. I don't laugh out loud easily & this one did it. Kevin James was a riot. The humor wasn't silly and most of the characters were as real as people ever get in romcoms. The movie relied on relationship rather than sex, which is a huge plus for me."
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe",2005,6.9,"While playing, Lucy and her siblings find a wardrobe that lands them in a mystical place called Narnia. Here they realize that it was fated and they must now unite with Aslan to defeat an evil queen.","Reviewers say 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' is lauded for its immersive fantasy world and standout performances, especially Tilda Swinton and Liam Neeson. Themes of courage and good triumphing over evil resonate, though some find the start slow and pacing rushed. CGI reliance and character depth are criticized, alongside the film's Christian themes. Battle scenes, though visually impressive, lack intensity for some viewers."
A Fish Called Wanda,1988,7.5,"In London, four very different people team up on a jewel heist, then try to double-cross one another for the loot, complicated by their efforts to fool the very proper barrister Archibald Leach.","To make a comedy that can be lauded with the comment 'absolutely hilarious' isn't an easy thing to do. It's not so difficult, however, when you are one of the funniest men on god's green earth; and the extremely talented John Cleese has certainly managed to write a fine piece of comedy here. Teaming up with Monty Python buddy Michael Palin and Ealing studios director Charles Crichton, these talented comedians have managed to create a film that is most certainly one of the funniest; laugh per minute and lasting hilarity when it's over, movies ever made. The plot is taken straight from the classic Ealing comedy era (no wonder it works so well) and it follows four crooks that have stolen a bunch of jewels and now decide to double cross one another to take the loot solely for themselves. The plot thickens when the female of the bunch decides that the best way to get the loot would be to get close to a grassed-up co-conspirator's barrister; John Cleese.Aside from an inch-perfect screenplay, A Fish Called Wanda also benefits from a fine cast of actors to deliver it. John Cleese steals every scene he's in, as you might expect, and he more than justifies his reputation as one of, maybe even the, finest British comedy actor ever. He is joined by a talented pair of Americans; Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis, along with, as mentioned, his fellow Python Michael Palin. Kline is certainly one of the most underrated actors working today, and his comic timing in this movie is right on the money. Makes you wonder how much better he could have been used over the years. ""Scream Queen"" Jamie Lee Curtis also does well in the title role; and Michael Palin obviously knows his way round a comedy script. The jokes in the film come thick and fast, and I can't think of a single one that didn't work. It's the big gags that are the real stand out of the movie, though, and one in particular that sees Kevin Kline trying to explain to Cleese's wife what he's doing in their home is absolutely priceless. I nearly fell of my chair laughing. This film is a must see."
It's Complicated,2009,6.6,"When attending their son's college graduation, a couple reignite the spark in their relationship. But the complicated fact is they're divorced and he's remarried.","""It's Complicated"" is pretty simple, actually. Successful Californian food store owner Meryl Streep has been happily divorced from her former husband Alex Baldwin for the last ten years, but on a trip to New York to attend their son's graduation, she starts an affair with him. He happens to have re-married, to a younger woman, while she becomes involved with her architect Steve Martin. Will Meryl and Alec get back together again, or will she set off into the sunset with Steve. ‚ÄãWhat will the children think? Do we care?Well, not a lot. The lifestyle depicted is one in which everything is perfect, especially the cast's complexions. There are no human imperfections depicted, unless you count lust. All the characters, with the partial exception of Meryl, are stereotypes ‚Äì people from Advertising land. In real life things are much more complicated.That said, this is a superior piece of its type and it passes the watch test (I didn't look at my watch while viewing it). True, I could watch Meryl reading the phone book, and yes the dialogue was witty and the set pieces funny, and I had some guilty enjoyment from all the affluence. But really it was all too sweet, like Meryl's chocolate cake. Alex Baldwin does a passable LA lawyer while Steve Martin seems to be in the wrong movie."
Night Falls on Manhattan,1996,6.6,A newly elected District Attorney finds himself in the middle of a police corruption investigation that may involve his father and his partner.,"This film is definitely based on the Larry Davis incident that took place in the late 80's where corrupt cops tried to shake down a drug dealer who wanted out of their ""system""(dealers who payed off cops to rob other dealers). When he got out due to the death of his infant daughter, they invaded his home, he fought back by killing and wounding some officers and escaped leading to a dangerous manhunt in NYC. When they finally caught him (an old family relative snicthced on him), false accusations were brought up by the police and the media to portray him as a ruthless thug who ran away after killing the cops when all he wanted to do was leave the organization involving crooked cops and drug dealers. He is still serving time in Rikers Island fighting for a new trial.Check out the documentary called THE LARRY DAVIS STORY which won an award for Best Documentary in the Urbanworld Film Festival in 2003.However, it serves well on film and Sidney Lumet is great act capturing the look and feel of NYC in the early 90's. It has a ""Prince of the City"" feel to it."
The Hangover,2009,7.7,Three buddies wake up from a bachelor party in Las Vegas with no memory of the previous night and the bachelor missing. They must make their way around the city in order to find their friend in time for his wedding.,"Hangover, The (2009)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Four buddies head off to Vegas for a bachelor party but the next morning they wake up not knowing what happened the night before and discovering one is missing. They must then try to retrace their steps and locate the missing buddy. I'm always a bit hesitant to fall into the mass market when it comes to something popular because a lot of times I end up watching the film and it turns out to be a major disappointment but that's not the case with this gem because it lived up to its reputation and in my opinion passed them. I'm not going to call this the greatest film of the year but I might add it's the most original. You'd think a comedy about getting messed up in Vegas would be ""been there, done that"" but this takes a familiar set up and does something original with it. Instead of showing us the crazy party night, we don't see a second of it and instead we're thrown into a mystery and the laughs come from trying to figure out that mystery. For my money the screenplay is nearly flawless as it does a great job at building up our thoughts on what happened but the film then takes us to places that you certainly won't see coming. The majority of the laughs come from things that you normally wouldn't expect like a masterful scene involving a trunk. Even the jokes that you do expect (strippers) is done extremely well and with hilarious results. I won't ruin many of the jokes because of the ""mystery"" behind them is what makes them work so well but there were several scenes where tears were running down my face from laughing so hard. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis give terrific performances and their chemistry and comic timing with one another helps push the film even further. The three make for an excellent team and watching this film makes it look like the trio had been working together for years because they come off so well together. Heather Graham isn't too bad in her role and the great Jeffrey Tambor even gets a nice laugh. You really have to respect a movie that takes a familiar plot and mixes it up to the point of it being completely original and most importantly, downright hilarious. I hate labeling films when they're so fresh but I would be shocked if this movie isn't looked at in ten years the same way we look at ""dirty"" comedies like NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE and PORKY'S today."
About Schmidt,2002,7.2,"Newly retired from the insurance industry, Omaha native Warren Schmidt embarks on an RV journey to his estranged daughter Jeannie's wedding in Denver Colorado, only to discover more about himself and life than he ever expected.","This is an inspiring story. It teaches me so much about what is important in life. Jack Nicholson, with a great performance as Warren R. Schmidt is an example of an American middle class after retiring. For many years he has worked as an actuary at a big insurance company. After retiring, Jack at home, while watching television, he decides to sponsor a six years old boy (Ndugu) from Tanzania. Sending a check of US$ 22,00 every month, he is also required to write a letter to the boy. In the process of writing these letters, he vents out to the boy about his life frustrations, his lost dreams and the dilemma he is in. He is married for forty-two years with his wife Helen (June Squibb) and he has a daughter living in Denver, Jeannie Schmidt (Hope Davis) who will marry a looser pretty soon. He misses his daughter. A few days after his retirement, his wife dies, and Jack realizes how important the wife was in his life now even though he never appreciated her. The director of the movie, Alexander Payne takes the audiences with Jack on a trip in a trailer to visit specific places in America. He mainly makes Jack visit the places where he has been before physically but at the same time Jack was revisiting his own life inside. In this trip he realizes what really matters in life - friendship, family and sharing- then why it is important to appreciate them whenever you have a chance.In 'Citizen Kane' (1941), the director Orson Welles portrays the same idea when creating Mr. Kane. The movie is more than the story of a tycoon's rise and fall; it is an account of what is ultimately important in a person's life. Even though Kane attains riches and prestige, he is far from happy. He ends with two failed marriages and few friends. At his dying bed, all he has left is his reminiscences - and something called ""Rosebud."" In 'About Schmidt' the director Alexander Payne uses voiceover to convey Jack's thoughts and memories throughout the movie. To be specific it is when Jack is writing a letter to the boy he sponsors - (Ndugu), at the same time Payne is informing the audience about Jack's regrets and pain concerning his wife and daughter while the movie is still rolling on. I think this is a great technique.I believe this has been a great adventure and wake up call to many Americans as to what is important in life and why we should cherish every moment of it."
American Pie 2,2001,6.5,"Jim and his friends are now in college, and they decide to meet up at the beach house for some fun.","I'll be first to admit that I hate teen comedies in general and typically frown upon most of them - I didn't even like ""There's Something About Mary"" too much, although I'm not sure it's really a ""teen"" film.I own all three ""American Pie"" films on DVD because they are one of the few teen series whose characters seem real and you actually feel empathy for. They're not awkward characterizations of real people without emotions - the movie takes time setting up their personalities, quirks, etc., and then places them in embarrassing situations. For example, the movie ""Swingers."" That telephone call Favreau makes is a painful experience for the viewer. Would it have been so painful if we hadn't gotten to know him throughout the movie? ""American Pie"" is kinda like that. It works well because of the characters. It's crude, yes. It's crass, very. It's sexist, maybe. But that's how guys are. It doesn't exploit these elements as many teen sex comedies do - some are moderately entertaining (like the Johnny Depp film ""Private Resort"") but unbelievable and basically just lots of skin. ""American Pie"" is better, one of the best of its genre.Everyone seems to hate the first sequel, which was released in 2001, a couple years after the original. Jim (Biggs) returns from college and hangs out for the summer at a beach house with his best pals. But with Stiffler (Seann William Scott) there, it's not too easy because they soon end up in more embarrassing situations.This movie is very similar to the original and normally I have a problem with this. Basically all the scenes are ""updates"" on scenes that existed in the original. E.g. the lesbian strip over the walkie-talkies, the incident with the glue, the whole thing with Stiffler's mom and Finch.Nevertheless it is effective, entertaining and funny. The characters are given more room to develop and believe it or not, I think I like this better than the first film. (The third is probably my favorite, if only for the focus on Stiffler and the introduction of Fred Willard, one of the great character actors of our time.) ""American Pie 2"" is somewhat recycled and some people may find it one of those ""pointless"" sequels, but I liked it, and this is coming from a guy who typically loathes these films - so considering I'm giving this seven stars, that says quite a lot. Either I'm out of my mind or there's something about these films that's just more accessible and likable than others in their genre."
The Reader,2008,7.6,"Post-WWII Germany: Nearly a decade after his affair with an older woman came to a mysterious end, law student Michael Berg re-encounters his former lover as she defends herself in a war-crime trial.","David Hare wrote one of my favorite female characters in ""Plenty"", Meryl Streep brought her to life in the most extraordinary way. Here, Hare writes another power house female character. It doesn't have the intellectual aspirations of ""Plenty"" but there is also a form of mental illness in his character. Kate Winslet is magnificent. Her early scenes with the wonderful David Kross are filled with compelling, contradictory and totally believable undertones. My misgivings are to be pinned on Stephen Daldry, the director. His sins as a filmmaker start to become a sort of trade mark, visible and palpable in the moving ""Billy Elliot"" and the shattering ""The Hours"" I can't quite pinpoint what it is but in ""The Reader"" that element is more obvious than in the other two. Maybe it has to do with loftiness. There are moments so frustratingly long and slow here that he lost me in more than one occasion. In any case, the cast makes this film a rewarding experience. Besides Kate Winslet and David Kross. The tortured Ralph Finnes has a couple of wonderful moments as well as Bruno Ganz and Lina Olin in a dual role."
Yes Man,2008,6.8,"A man challenges himself to say ""yes"" to everything.","Jim Carrey is Superb, YET AGAIN, in his 2008 box-office hit 'Yes Man'. A Decent Comedy, that works mostly because of Carrey's Performance.'Yes Man' Synopsis: A guy challenges himself to say ""yes"" to everything for an entire year.'Yes Man' is entertaining & innovative. Sure, it's not out-and-out hilarious, but Carrey's Matchless Comic-Timing & Impeccable Screen-Presence do the trick.Nicholas Stoller, Jarrad Paul & Andrew Mogel's Screenplay is Innovative & Funny. Peyton Reed's Direction is passable. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are mention-worthy.Performance-Wise: Obviously, Carrey owns this film, with a Superb Performance. The Legendary Actor is truly unbeatable! Zooey Deschanel is excellent. Bradley Cooper is quite good. John Michael Higgins does well. Terence Stamp is awesome.On the whole, 'Yes Man' works! Say ""YES"" to this one!"
"I Love You, Man",2009,7.0,"Friendless Peter Klaven goes on a series of man-dates to find a Best Man for his wedding. But, when his insta-bond with his new B.F.F. puts a strain on his relationship with his fianc√©e, can the trio learn to live happily ever after?","Funny movies have to be funny. That's the only rule about funny movies. They don't have to live up to any expectations, they can be about the same thing that movies always are. It really doesn't matter. As long as they are funny.I Love You, Man is a funny movie. In case the plot is of any interest to you, it's about this guy (Paul Rudd) who is getting married to this woman (Rashida Jones), but he realizes that he doesn't really have any male friends to fill out his side of the wedding party. So he starts on a quest with the aid of his brother (Andy Samberg) to find a best man. When he finally thinks he finds one (Jason Segel), hilarity ensues.On the spectrum of comedies, this is a bro movie. One made basically for guys, a little raunchy. But honestly, it's not too R-rated. It cusses a bit, discusses sex a lot, things like that. But not nearly as R-rated as say... Role Models, which I feel is sort of along the same lines. Comparable at least. They are both very funny movies, and both have Paul Rudd.But this is about I Love You, Man. The highlight of the movie, for me, is Thomas Lennon as Doug. I have been a fan of his for a long time, at least since Reno 911 came out. Which is a brilliant show. Paul Rudd is very, very cute, but not always convincing, the same with Rashida Jones as his fianc√©e. It's a movie that Ben Stiller would have made if he were younger. Jason Segel does what Jason Segel does. He plays his role very capably as Sydney, the crazed friend.And that is I Love You, Man. It's a rather simple, but funny movie."
The Place Beyond the Pines,2012,7.3,A stunt rider turns into a robber in order to lead a happy life with his child and lover and grabs the attention of a police officer. They both get on a collision course that affects their families.,"If I have to be honest here, I cried my eyes out like a baby during most of the film. For some reason, this drama just hit a very sensitive spot for me. - I am almost certain that it was Ryan Gosling's outstanding performance that hit me deep in my gamut of emotions, resulting in various intense feelings of compassion and sympathy that just seemed to keep appearing throughout the film - he represents such a heartwarming yet melancholic character who you can't help but to sympathize with. In the most beautifully portrayed way, we undergo af journey starting from Luke Glantons' (Ryan Gosling) unfortunate situation to smoothly transitioning into Avery Cross' (Bradley Cooper) life whilst issues such as fraud within police departments, abandonment, poverty and social heritage are illuminated in the thrill of it all - and the crazy mixture of different perspectives and issues all makes sense. More I can't say, or else I will reveal the whole plot. The only thing left to say is, if you don't know what you're going to expect from this movie, you're going in for a storytelling told untraditionally, composed perfectly ending with a somewhat circular structure. - Trust me, this only makes sense in the end.
To finish off with a sentence: This movie represents a classic example of your unethical actions coming back to taunt you."
Julie & Julia,2009,7.0,"Julie Powell, a young blogger, is determined to emulate Julia Child's cooking techniques. Though separated by time, the two women share a common passion for food that intertwines their lives.","Ms. Streep's performance alone makes this film worthwhile--in recent years she has really shown her great talent as a comedian (Adaptation, Devil Wears Prada, this film). She has great comic timing, and always goes just far enough for the laugh, and usually not too far that it feels staged or unnatural.From the reviews I read, I was really expecting not to like the ""Julie"" half of this movie--but I was pleasantly surprised. I read both ""Julie and Julia"" and ""My Life in France"" earlier this summer, and I have to confess that I didn't love the Julie Powell book. Amy Adams really brings this character to life and makes you care about her (more so, I think than the book did). One problem with the balance in this project is that Julia Child did something really important for cooking in America, and so her story is inherently interesting. Julie Powell wrote a book. That became a movie. Add to that the fact that the heavy hitters in the film all live on the Julia side--Streep, Stanley Tucci, and a great cameo by Jane Lynch--and the deck feels fully stacked. Full credit to Amy Adams and Chris Messina, then, for making us care about the half of the film that teetered on the edge of the perfunctory.This film is all the more remarkable in that it is so rare to see a film these days that just revels in joie-de-vivre. I'm sure a lot of the rough edges of Julia's personality are smoothed over--but some of the stressful moments are there. I just felt so much affection for Streep's Julia Child in this movie--and I laughed repeatedly and heartily at her antics. A fun time at the movies--which is a rarer pleasure than it should be."
Meet the Parents,2000,7.0,"Chicago male nurse and chronic under-achiever Greg Focker meets his charming teacher girlfriend Pam Byrnes' parents Jack and Dina before proposing, but suspicious Jack is an overprotective former CIA agent - every date's worst nightmare.","Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) is a male nurse, poised to propose to the woman he loves, Pam (Teri Polo) but the right thing to do would be to ask her father's permission first. During a weekend of getting to know them, he manages to make a strong impression; for all the wrong reasons. Her father (Robert De Niro) isn't quite what Greg has been led to believe, and right from the start he seems to have it in for his daughter's partner.De Niro and Stiller play off each other brilliantly, and both of them give fine comic performances, with a surprising level of depth for comedy characters. This film is packed with slick gags, hilarious scenes and it has a really fun story; it's a comedy film that you don't want to miss.8/10"
Home Alone,1990,7.7,"An eight-year-old troublemaker, mistakenly left home alone, must defend his home against a pair of burglars on Christmas Eve.","'Home Alone' has succeeded in establishing itself as a Christmas tradition, spawning off three sequels (including a made-for-television flop), and a whole franchise in and of it.Macaulay Culkin plays Kevin McCallister, the average American child. He has an attitude almost expected of a Chris Columbus film from the eighties. He lives with a large family, which, right now, being around Christmas time, is about quadrupled, flooded by relatives' children, all of whom pick on poor, poor Kevin (sympathy long lost later into the film).One day Kevin wakes up from his sleep to find his wish has come true: his parents (John Heard and Catherine O'Hara) have disappeared. Enthralled by this, he proceeds to do everything and anything he was not allowed to do before, including eating ice cream in the morning, watching violent gangster films, jumping on the bed, wrecking his brother's room, and having some fun with a BB gun. Unfortunately for Kevin, his parents have not just disappeared - they have accidentally left him at home before going to Paris!Trouble really starts when two pesky burglars, Harry Lime (Joe Pesci) and Marv Merchants (Daniel Stern), decide that their next burglary will be at the McCallister residence. Little do they know Kevin is more than prepared, arming the house with an array of booby-traps that would impress top spies in the American government.John Hughes, writer/director/producer of my favorite comedy, 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles,' wrote this film, and it is no wonder. It is just like Hughes' humor. It mixes emotion, belly laughs and a warm-hearted ending all into one little bundle called a movie. John Hughes' films, in my experience, are usually very good, mainly because he approaches films at a very classic level. He doesn't resort to crude, kid jokes, like 'The Master of Disguise' or 'The Tuxedo,' to name a few recent flops. He almost always levels everything out perfectly in his scripts, and nothing is different here. Also, he places Kevin and co. in a large brick home in a large neighborhood in Chicago; a home that very much resembles those in 'Planes.' and 'Uncle Buck' (I would not be surprised if it is the same home).As for the acting.Macaulay Culkin is not at his best here. His best performance would have to be in an earlier John Hughes film named 'Uncle Buck,' where he had more of a cute charm than an acting charm. Here, he could barely act his way out of a plastic bag. Fortunately, with great performances by John Heard, Catherine O'Hara, Pesci and Stern, his bad acting is long forgotten by the time we become absorbed into the film.John Heard and Catherine O'Hara bring Kevin's parents to life. They seem almost complete opposites. Kevin's father, Peter (Heard), is very calm and laidback. His mother, Kate (O'Hara) is extremely nervous almost all the time, fretting throughout the film. She is aggravated very easily and, like all mothers, her instinctive nature to care for her child is what drives her to the point she goes to in the film.And then there's Pesci and Stern. My favorite lot of the film. They perfectly blend humor, pain and aggravation to the film.Pesci's character Harry is very strict, easily agitated and picks on Marv for a great many things. Marv, the stereotypical 'tall, stupid one,' is completely stupid. He does things that would make a hamster blush. Yet he is the character I have found many like the most, mainly because he is so stupid you have to feel sorry for him. Stern brings a great trait to the character of Marv, and I am very pleased he got the part. It's a hard choice to decide which baddie is better, so I just say I like them both the same.All in all, 'Home Alone' is probably the best Christmas movie to rise out of the film industry in the last twenty years. It seamlessly blends humor, pain, emotion, human instinct and some great booby-traps all into one little bundle. This film has stood the test of time greatly.4.5/5 stars -"
The 40 Year Old Virgin,2005,7.1,"Goaded by his buddies, a nerdy guy who's never ""done the deed"" only finds the pressure mounting when he meets a single mother.","Something about the 40 Year Old Virgin and the other comedy hit of the summer, Wedding Crashers, is similar, but they are two different films in some respects. Both are romantic comedies that have that kind of over-the-top, crazy sensibility that keeps the teens and guys in their 20's along with the usual dating crowd to go see the films. Both have some sort of formula to the stories as well. But by the end of the 40 Year Old Virgin, I think I found overall it was more satisfying than 'Crashers'. Although one can guess where the relationship story with Steve Carrell's character Andy and Catherine Keener's character Trish will go to, it isn't too basic for one to figure out like with Crashers, and the characters both leading and supporting are realistic, more rounded than most of the one-dimensional or unexplained people in the other. And, perhaps, it may also depend on how much you identify (or just find the lunacy) in both.The thing is some people may go into The 40 Year Old Virgin not knowing Steve Carrell as well as Owen Wilson or Vince Vaughn, as Carrell has built up his cult status on The Daily Show (one of my favorite shows on now) and in small but unforgettably riotous roles in Anchorman and Bruce Almighty. This is his first starring role, but it's not treated like some third rate vehicle. He and co-writer/director Judd Apatow treat the character of Andy with a certain level of sincerity that keeps the audience on his side all the way, even early on as he talks to his action figures while re-painting them. It's also a tricky line to walk on- in lessor hands this could be no more or less entertaining than the Lackluster 40 Days and 40 Nights with Josh Hartnett (also about sexual dysfunction). As the title suggests, Andy is the 40 year old who is like the nice guy friend with still a little Pee-Wee Herman in him (the opening over the credits of his his apartment is hilarious, a good sign).So, his friends (among them Paul Rudd, Romany Mancoy, Seth Rogen, all very good comic foils) try and devise different strategies and tips to finally break the sort of curse over Andy's head to pop his cherry, so to speak. He almost gets with a overly drunk woman, he almost gets with a freaky kind of girl, and almost with his own boss (Jane Lynch, also very funny in the mockumentaries) as a (explitive) buddy. But this soon all starts to fade as he gets into a meaningful relationship with Trish, who works across the street from him. As they build on a relationship not based at all on sex, one might worry that the plot gear of ""how is he going to tell her such and such"" might get in the way of the comedy. It doesn't. In fact, if anything, Carrell and the cast build on it to a very high degree. For practically an hour and a half of the film's two hour length, there was barely a moment I wasn't laughing, whether big or small.The big laughs though make up for not just any kind of formalities with the plot, or one or two little stray stories (the fellow co-workers have their own relationship problems as well, Rudd's being the funniest). The big laughs come through because of Carrell's reactions, and that the people around him can either back up with their own sort of humor/charm, or that its with some truth. Keener gives a very good performance and makes it so that there is a genuine spirit to their relationship (and, un-like 'Crashers', there isn't as much that doesn't make sense character wise). For someone like me who loves it when a comedian can get laughs just from the way he looks on his face, Carrell gets very high points here. And like with a Farrelly brothers movie, the more raunchy or outrageous scenes are done with total absurdity; the 'waxing' scene (which was done for real, by the way) and the sort of Aquarius musical number towards the very end of the film (the way it comes out at first is a total, uproarious surprise). But if you're willing not to get offended by it, there's more where that came from. This is one of the funniest films of the year."
Prisoners,2013,8.2,A desperate father takes the law into his own hands after police fail to find two kidnapped girls.,"Prisoners, the new film from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Polytechnique), is a top notch nail-biting crime-drama that is as good a theatre as modern Hollywood has the ability to produce.Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello play the parental figures of the Dover family. They are your average hard-working blue-collar family who begin their story by visiting neighbours Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) for a Thanksgiving dinner. The Franklins and the Dover's each have two children, the youngest of which (Anna and Joy) head out from their home on a November afternoon to play only to mysteriously disappear.Upon a frantic search, the Franklins and the Dover's suspect the worse. Especially when their elder children tell them of a mysterious camper that was parked just down the street. Police soon find the camper with Alex Jones (Paul Dano) behind the wheel. Alex has the mentality of a 10-year-old and tries fleeing when surrounded by authorities. But when Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) begins to interrogate Alex, he is less convinced that Alex was a part of the abduction. As days pass, Loki and Keller Doller work in opposite directions on the investigation. Keller is convinced that Alex Jones was a part of the abduction and kidnaps the frail and challenged Jones and tortures him for days in an attempt to extract answers. Meanwhile, Detective Loki follows leads that open up possibilities of a crime where multiple persons may be involved. And Oscar nominee Melissa Leo appears in a supporting but pivotal role that will assist in the closure.The trailer for Prisoners may have audiences hearkening back to Ron Howard's Ransom, but this is hardly the cookie-cutter kidnapping film that Mel Gibson lead back in 1996. Prisoners instead is an engulfing drama. One with a superb performance by lead Hugh Jackman that challenges how far someone would/should go in an effort to locate their stolen child.The script, from writer Aaron Guzikowski (Contrband) takes audiences down many different paths and emotional rides and Jackman's performance will have you rooting for his quest for answers even though his methods are unorthodox and highly illegal.The film is gritty and full of realistic characters and situations culminating in a perfect ending that goes 9/10ths of the way in giving its audience full closure. Not as much an edge-of-your seat thriller as it is a Zodiac type of crime drama where the stakes are the lives of two small children.Denis Villeneuve's last effort, Incendies, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 2011. Prisoners shows that he can move solidly into big star larger scaled films with the ease of a well worn slipper. And Prisoners catapults Villeneuve into not just a director to watch, but a director whose work should be awaited with palpable excitement.www.killerreviews.com"
Hancock,2008,6.4,Hancock is a superhero whose ill-considered behavior regularly causes damage in the millions. He changes when the person he saves helps him improve his public image.,"I also was at the test screening in Peoria AZ. The film was spot on for the first hour. Jokes were hitting left and right, Smith and Bateman displayed good chemistry, and the special effects, though not always finished, were eye popping nonetheless.Without giving it away, the final half hour was flat, straying from the comical nature that had preceded it and instead tried to get philosophical and introduce a week paint'by'numbers villain. I spoke with director Peter Berg after the film and he seemed fully aware of the issues relating to the final act. Hopefully the recent ""re shoot"" will polish up that last act, making Hancock one of the must see blockbusters of the summer. In the form I saw it; it still has a ways to go."
Friends with Money,2006,5.8,"After she quits her lucrative job, Olivia finds herself unsure about her future and her relationships with her successful and wealthy friends.","""Friends With Money"" seems like an incomplete film. It's as if writer-director Nicole Holofcener either got tired of her characters and simply ran out of ideas. I don't mind films where nothing much happens or there is no narrative conclusion. But there seems something awfully unfinished and undeveloped about this movie.On the other hand, what makes it watchable are the performances.Jennifer Aniston does her best work since ""The Good Girl"" (2002). She still has the best chance of the ""Friends"" cast to have a sterling film career, if she continues doing work like this - at least playing characters like Olivia. She should stay away from playing femmes fatale - her performance in last year's dismal ""Derailed"" was ample proof she's not ready to venture into Stanwyck or Fiorentino territory, yet.But Aniston has a fine sense of finding that line between comedy and drama without pushing either one too far. Her Olivia is a believable person who just has incredibly lousy taste in men - thus far. Watching the hurt and disappointment on Aniston's face when Mike's (Scott Caan) true character comes out shows this woman's got talent.Mike actually might be this film's most intriguing and interesting character. Caan's very good in the role and just when you think you like him, he does something despicable.Holofcener's film centers around a group of friends, most of whom are affluent, if not stinking rich. The exception is Olivia. And throughout the film, Holofcener unveils their pains, insecurities and flaws.Joan Cusack plays the guilt-ridden wealthy woman well and Catherine Keener, again, proves why she remains so incredibly under-rated. Here's an actress who can take small moments in a film and turn them into unforgettable ones. Keener's so completely compelling and honest in her performance. Christine's discussions with her husband, David (Jason Isaacs), never ring false thanks to two strong performances.The weak link in the film really is Frances McDormand's Jane. This isn't the wonderful McDormand's fault. Trouble is, Holofcener paints McDormand's Jane as such a one-dimensional person - a woman who turns her suppressed rage into a rather annoying persona. Holofcener never bothers to penetrate the surface of Jane's problems. We just know she's angry and that's all we see of her. It's a shame because a woman of McDormand's infinite acting talents deserved a much richer character.""Friends With Money"" seems rather superficial at times because, unlike Holofcener's previous two films, this one simply skirts the surface of the characters. With the exception of Olivia and, to a lesser extent, Christine, we never see other sides to these people.There's more to their stories. Much more. But Holofcener shows no interest in going there."
Promised Land,2012,6.6,"A salesman for a natural gas company experiences life-changing events after arriving in a small town, where his corporation wants to tap into the available resources.","I would honestly give this film a 9 out of ten. It was directed beautifully, and I feel the screenplay is great. The dialogue is more than believable, and both Matt Damon and John Kransinski both do a wonderful job in conveying their character's qualities and aspirations. There seldom seemed to be a slow moment(if at all).As far as how close to reality this movie comes.... I live in northeastern Pennsylvania, only 5 minutes away from Harford, and only 25 minutes away from Dimock(where the documentary Gasland was based). I have seen the effects of hydrofracking, both the negative and what little positive comes of it(but those facts and feelings are for another discussion). As sad as it may seem, natural gas and well drilling companies(to go un-named ONLY in this review) bought their way into the community with false hope, money, and lies, but not necessarily as it happened in the film. In reality.... it was even worse. Barbecues, parties, etc. were even thrown in order to gain fans and friends... The community's spirit and resilience was conveyed correctly, though in reality, it gained support too late.All in all, even if political/social/ecological issues regarding hydrofracking aren't your forte, this film is a quality film that is captivating and deserves to have personal opinions set aside and enjoyed for its quality."
To Rome with Love,2012,6.3,"The lives of some visitors and residents of Rome and the romances, adventures and predicaments they get into.","We have seen Woody Allen's multiple love letters to New York City, London, Barcelona, and Paris; now he sets his satirical eye on the ancient city of Rome. Starting halfway through the previous decade, Woody Allen altered his standard oeuvre from mostly comedic farce with a dash of autobiographical drama set amongst towering New York skyscrapers to films set in major European centers where the city itself is almost its own character. Barcelona nudged its way into the love triangle of Vicky Christina Barcelona and Paris's nightclubs and streets were a central character along with Ernest Hemingway and Gertrude Stein in Midnight in Paris. In To Rome with Love, Woody is even less subtle about his intentions by loudly proclaiming in the film's title what he is up to.There are multiple stories entering and exiting the stage with even more characters; however, unlike the majority of films which juggle numerous plot lines, these do not intersect; they exist by themselves and involve their own unique Roman characteristics. There is John (Alec Baldwin) who chooses to retrace his former life as a young man in Rome 30 years ago and ends up having a very interesting encounter with Jack (Jesse Eisenberg), Sally (Greta Gerwig), and the flippant Monica (Ellen Page). John has seen it all before and sets himself up as a Greek Chorus variant to the younger crowd. By the end of their section, every man in the audience over 30 should be nodding their heads in agreement about the Sally vs. Monica pros and cons. Their love triangle is a convenient excuse to insert the ancient ruins and architecture which you knew must fit somewhere in the film.Hayley (Alison Pill) is in her early 20s and fulfills one of the ultimate lost tourist clich√©s in Rome; she bumps into Michelangelo (Flavio Parenti), falls in love, and decides to spend the rest of her life in Italy. Upon hearing the news, Hayley's parents, Phyllis (Judy Davis) and Jerry (Allen), jet over to Rome to meet this guy and survey the situation. In his typical Woody Allen way, Jerry has a lot to say about the turbulence on the flight over, sizes up Michelangelo as a Communist, and can barely stand the irony that Michelangelo's father, Giancarlo (Fabio Armiliato), is an undertaker. Leave it to Woody to be able to fit his absolute phobia of death and all its accompaniments into a film about Rome. This particular film segment uses Roman opera as its backdrop with a very clever farce involving singing in the shower.The most blatant comedic segment in the film is Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni). He is just a regular working stiff who wakes up at the same time every morning, eats his toast, goes to work, engages in water cooler talk, and comes home. One day, Leopoldo starts getting chased by obsessive paparazzi and screaming autograph seekers wherever he goes who want to know what he likes on his toast, how he shaves, and whether he is a boxers or briefs man. There is no reason for his sudden fame explosion which confuses Leopoldo all the more. This also confused the old ladies sitting next to me; however, this was a brilliant way for Allen to skewer the celebrity fetish. Some people are famous for just being famous even though they have accomplished absolutely nothing.It seems Woody Allen used his most recent European love letter to fit in some messages he has had stirring around his brain for a little bit. He tackles the odd fascination with know- and do-nothing celebrities, the appeal of going after the vapid and attractive female even though you know she is ridiculous and it will only end badly, and what I suppose is a critique of not being a prude at the beginning of marriage. Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi) and Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi) have just arrived in Rome after their wedding to start their new life. Through a silly and contrived sequence of events which only serve to set up a ridiculous situation, Antonio winds up with a stunningly gorgeous prostitute, Anna (Penelope Cruz), and Milly winds up tempted by her most favorite actor in the world. This particular part of the film does not work too well but it does provide plenty of laughs as inappropriately clad Anna visits the Vatican.To Rome with Love is not among the top tier of Woody Allen's decade long infatuation with filming in European locales (Midnight in Paris) but it is certainly not the worst (Scoop). Weaving in and out of these disconnected plot lines is fun and most of them are quite enjoyable. Using Rome and all of its wonderful settings to tie all of his characters together easily helps out what will most likely become one of the more middle of the road and average Wood Allen pictures. However, it is worth noting than an average Woody Allen film is head and shoulders above what is playing down the street in your local multiplex right now."
Machine Gun Preacher,2011,6.7,Sam Childers is a former drug-dealing biker tough guy who found God and became a crusader for hundreds of Sudanese children who've been forced to become soldiers.,I m not a usual review writer of any kind but i especially register for IMDb to write about this movie. After watching the movie and checking the IMDb rate i must say it is highly underestimated and i was forced to make a statement.i would recommend this movie. it leaves you thinking not only about the characters itself but also about the issue of the movie. I myself spend hours of researching about the problems which are shown in the movie.i find the characters very appealing although at some point i thought it could be portrayed better than it was actually done.Overall it is a really good movie and worth a watch.
Mortal Kombat,,7.3,A motley crew of fighters are recruited one by one to take part in a deadly inter-dimensional martial arts tournament in which the future of the planet itself is at stake.,"Well I wouldn't really call myself a huge fan of the ""Mortal Kombat"" franchise, but I did play the games when I was younger, even got a couple of them for my PS3 today, and have watched the older movies, series and even read some of the comic books. I like ""Mortal Kombat"" for what it is, martial arts fighting without the need to implement a deeper understanding for the reason behind it.However, I will say that this ""Legacy"" series is impressive. Especially compared to the older movies and the earlier ""Conquest"" series. Why? Well simply put because of the production value behind it. It outshines the previous stuff by a mile and a half. There is just a heavier and better feel to this series, it is more in the spirit of ""Mortal Kombat"", if you will.I like how it takes each character and gives you some background behind who they are and what drives them. It is all done in a relatively short period of time in each episode, so of course it is limited just how much background story you get about each character. But so far it has been great entertainment and added some nice details to the characters portrayed so far.As for the acting, well I have been content with the people they have cast for the various roles. People have been doing great jobs bringing the characters alive and believable on the screen. My personal favorites are Scorpion and Sub-Zero, always have and always will be.I find ""Legacy"" to be a well worthy addition to the ""Mortal Kombat"" universe, and it is well worth watching just for the production value behind the series alone. It is really, really great.I sort of gave up on this franchise as a plausible rendering on the screen after the ""Conquest"" series, so it was just by sheer random luck that I came across ""Legacy"", and it was just out of boredom that I sat down to watch it. But after the first episode, I just kept going watching it all, it was just that good. So perhaps ""Mortal Kombat"" can have a glorious comeback on the screen and justify itself after some questionable previous movies and an even less so series. I am excited to find out..."
The Adventures of Tintin,2011,7.3,Intrepid reporter Tintin and Captain Haddock set off on a treasure hunt for a sunken ship commanded by Haddock's ancestor.,"Since 1981, Spielberg has become an avid fan of this gorgeous ""Tintin"" comics and has been longing to create a film about it. Before he and ""Tintin's"" master, Herge could meet, Herge passed away. However, Herge's widow decided to give them the rights and began the adventure to re-create this marvelous wonder of art.Adapted from three of the comics, Spielberg's re-creation of the comics introduces us to Tintin (Jamie Bell), a Belgian reporter who gets caught up in all sorts of adventures. One day, he found a model of a ship, the Unicorn and bought it and brought it home. However, when Tintin was buying the ship, two men came to try to buy the model, Sakharine (Daniel Craig) and Barnaby. Later, Tintin discovers that the model holds an important secret and somehow, the secret is linked to the real ship itself. On the way for answers, he meets the grumpy Haddock and head off to an adventure spanning around the globe with his white fluffy dog Snowy.The animation is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. It's not right to call it a CGI film as the motion of the characters are much smoother than that of CGI films. Tintin's animated self looks stunning (even though he looks kind of different from his comic-self) in his blue long sleeves. Snowy is fluffier than ever. Captain Haddock is grumpier than ever. All of the animation is simply breathtaking and the best I've ever seen.I like how they change scenes. While most other movies just shift scenes normally, this film uses a little imagination and is ingenious in shifting scenes. They can change from a scene of shaking hands to a desert scene by using the outline of the two hands into the surface of the desert. This thing is just entertaining and great in its own right and deserves some reward.The movie itself is fun to watch. The story is compelling, the lines are natural-sounding, and the action is plenty of fun to watch. It is great excitement to watch and I was hooked from beginning to end. Great plot + awesome action + breathtaking animation equals up to amazing movie.The 3D is perfectly fine. The depth is seen and the 3D just makes the movie even more fun to watch.I definitely recommend you to watch this film. ""Tintin"" fan or no, this is sheer fun to watch. If this movie is out in your country, watch it immediately. For U.S. citizens, I'm sorry if you still have to wait for a while but I promise you, this is like no other movie. This movie is over the top and is plenty of fun to watch. A full 10 out of 10! Thanks for reading my review on ""The Adventures of Tintin"". I do hope this review is of good use to you."
Wie is bang voor Virginia Woolf?,1966,8.0,"A middle-aged New England associate professor and his wife, with the help of alcohol, use their young guests to fuel anguish and emotional pain towards each other over the course of a distressing night.","Ailing couple George (Burton) and Martha (Taylor) invite a young couple over for a late-night drink - much to quiet and repressed George's annoyance - and what starts off as a twisted game by sultry Martha to annoy her husband and get her way with young stud Nick (George Segal) ends up in a horrific duel of wits.Adapted from the play and boasting very few locations, ""Virginia Woolf"" is notable for many unsuspected reasons. Designed for the stage, the film makes the story uniquely cinematic and tense, amped up by stunning photography (in Black and White, a daring choice in 1966). The younger leads are superb, but Burton and Taylor still manage to walk away with film, giving stunning renditions of the world's most demented couple. They make the surreal dialogue hurt and touch in ways never thought possible.Though there are countless reasons to recommend this jewel of a film, there are also reasons why one would wish to avoid it. This is the kind of film that makes you feel like having a showing (or a very concentrated drink) to wash away the grit and human evil and pain absorbed. You'll feel dirty, but in a way you'll also feel enlightened: that a small character film can carry more punch than any explosion-packed blockbuster out there is a thing of beauty indeed!"
Arthur Newman,2012,5.6,"A story of a man who fakes his own death and assumes a new identity in order to escape his life, who then moves in with a woman who is also trying to leave her past behind.","This road movie, featuring solid performances from its main players, doesn't seem to know where it's going. While ""Arthur Newman"" presents many quirky or compelling tableaux, I was rather frustrated by the filmmaker's (Dante Ariola) detours and dead ends. Or perhaps it was writer Becky Johnston's tepid story that ran out of fuel.Frankly, I didn't care one way or another if the main characters ever resolved their respective conflicts, and after the first thirty minutes I felt like I was simply watching the same scene over and over again, like an endless roundabout. I was so uninvolved in the relationship(s) that it felt like nothing of any real substance was truly at stake or on the line."
Holy Man,1998,5.0,"An over-the-top television evangelist finds a way to turn television home shopping into a religious experience, and takes America by storm.","Maybe I'm a little off kilter, but I liked ""Holy Man."" It is an oft-told tale of shunning materialism for deeper more fulfilling things such as love, sharing, and nature.Eddie Murphy plays G, a spiritual man in simple garb who was performing a pedal pilgrimage through America when he happened upon Ricky (Jeff Goldblum) and Kate (Kelly Preston). Ricky and Kate are two execs for the struggling Good Buy Shopping Network (a fictitious QVC). When Ricky gives G shelter for a spell he decides to use G on the GBSN to help sales. The ploy works fabulously, but is it the right thing to do?""Holy Man"" isn't going to have you falling over with laughter as you'd expect with Eddie Murphy. In fact, I would normally expect non-stop laughs with Murphy and Goldblum together, but this is not that kind of movie. It is more of a sensitive piece aimed at touching people's hearts. I can see by the ratings that it didn't quite do that. I didn't find it particularly moving myself, but I found it enjoyable for being simple and uncomplicated."
Szerelempatak,2013,8.0,"In a drowsy Transylvanian village where most residents are octogenarians, romance blooms as the few remaining men compete for the attention of 25 widows, sparking tales of love both scandalous and tender.","Was fortunate enough to watch and understand this documentary in its unspoiled native language and accent. I am proud to call that broader region by birthplace. I can only imagine what impression could this piece of art leave on someone foreign to that culture, tradition and those times so vividly recalled by the subjects. Based on the trailer I was so looking forward to watch it in all its glory and was certainly not disappointed. It seems slow in places, but earnest and unspoiled through and through. Hilarious in a one moment, but drowning in sorrow in the next. It provokes you think about human nature and how we let it be imprisoned by society and expectations. Will watch it again at the TIFF, definitely a film festival material."
Malavita,2013,6.3,"The Manzoni family, a notorious Mafia clan, is relocated to Normandy, France, under the Witness Protection Program, where fitting in soon becomes challenging as their old habits die hard.","I just watched ""The Family"" and I for one have had a very good time. This movie is gleefully dark, wickedly funny and offers great acting from all the stars involved, (who really seem to relish their parts). I was shocked when I checked IMDb and found so many comments and reviews from disappointed film fans. How can anyone complain about the violence in this dark comedy and at the same time love films like ""Fargo"" (or practically anything by the Coen Brothers, for that matter)? I came to the conclusion that the main reason behind all the negative reviews is that people expected something more akin to ""L√©on"", ""Goodfellas"" or ""The Godfather"" (where the violence isn't played for laughs), when in fact this is something completely different: This is a black comedy about a group of predators who have to hide among - unbearably arrogant - sheep. You can imagine how well that will turn out (for the sheep). Anyway, I admit that with other actors involved, this would probably just have been an average mob comedy, but with the kind of talent you get here, it's hard not to have a blast. My rating: 7 out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
We're the Millers,2013,7.0,A veteran pot dealer creates a fake family as part of his plan to move a huge shipment of weed into the U.S. from Mexico.,"We're the Millers (2013)Okay, this seems like just another goofy comedy, but it's pretty great. It's funny, has lots of fun twists, and some good comic lines. But more than that, it creates a kind of intimacy and sense of real family (a sense of it) that makes you realize what family is all about. Yeah, unlikely, I know, but it works. When the two ""fake"" parents start to act like real ones, it's funny but also moving.Who woulda thought?It's hard to say who pulls this off‚Äîclearly the ""parents"" are terrific, Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis. And the two kids are pretty good too, if clich√©d. But what makes it all happen is the breezy comic writing. The basic set up is filled with clich√©s, and you have to like corny humor to really enjoy the play on these. So there are drug lords and immigrations officials. There are dorky RV tourists and clueless bystanders everywhere. But kick back and don't' expect too much and be surprised.And don't miss the bloopers in the final credits. Among them is a great moment where they play the theme to ""Friends"" on the RV radio, and it seems to catch Aniston by surprise. Group admiration."
12 Rounds,2009,5.6,"Detective Danny Fisher discovers his girlfriend has been kidnapped by an ex-con tied to Fisher's past, and he'll have to successfully complete 12 challenges in order to secure her safe release.","If you're going to watch this movie, it will be to see vehicles crash into other vehicles and cause lots of damage. This movie does that very well. It will also be for the nonstop excitement in a number of scenes, including the thrilling runaway streetcar. And the suspense of wondering if Det. Fisher can complete each challenge in time, breaking all the rules along the way. He has so many challenges and each one just leads to another one, equally impossible.Sure, we've seen this sort of thing before, but if I enjoy the formula, so what?But this movie isn't without problems. Aidan Gillen didn't quite reach the point of being deliciously evil, though the potential was there and he achieved what I hoped for in a few scenes.And some of the writing was pretty bad. Cops are supposed to be smarter than this. FBI agents are supposed to be smarter too. One of the movie's final scenes had some of the most pathetic writing imaginable. But that's just the dialogue. The action in that scene was great.I was disappointed to see Steve Harris from the critically acclaimed ""Awake"" in this. He didn't add much. And by the way, that's not him asleep in that streetcar. I couldn't understand what he was doing there, given the urgency of the situation.With all the killing that takes place, the violence isn't graphic. You know people die, but you don't see the blood.I particularly liked scenes with Danny and Molly together when not trying to stay alive. One highlight is Molly trying to repair the plumbing and I'm not talking about her mechanical skills. These scenes had some funny lines, and as terrible as certain events were, the movie's last line was really funny.It was ... interesting."
Adam's Apples,2005,7.7,A neo-Nazi sentenced to community service at a church clashes with the blindly devoted minister.,"This was a wonderful surprise at the (Cleveland) CIFF, a well-made dark comedy.Adam is a neo-Nazi on a sort of Danish ""probation for reprobates"", where society's sinners are given a gradual re-introduction to public life under the guidance of Ivan, a parish minister. Adam needs to negotiate a ""program"" for his several weeks stay; despite his efforts at being arch and cynical Ivan takes him totally in seriousness, setting ""baking an apple pie"" as Adam's goal. A battle of wills ensues between Adam and Ivan, with wonderful comedic support from Gunnar (Nicolas Bro in another wonderful role) the ex-tennis player and Khalid (Ali Kazim) as a not-yet-reformed terrorist.Everyone is coping here, but the central character is clearly Ivan (perhaps the funniest I've seen Mads Mikkelsen!). He comes across as ""Pangloss"" with a twist: ""everything is for the best"" in this world only in that the devil conspires to make everything a test of man's faith. He is completely deluded yet completely steadfast. This rational irrationality is perhaps the greatest challenge to Adam; no matter what he does Ivan retains his faith¬Öto a point where the comedy simply takes another course.Not to give away the delight of this comedy's surprises, the characters cope with life, each other, are exasperated and exasperating, consistently inconsistent¬Öthe trials of Job are well played out in this barely disguised absurdist romp."
The Marine 2,,4.9,"While on vacation, an American Marine sniper takes on local rebels who have seized control of the island hotel resort where he and his wife, who is now a hostage for ransom, have been staying.","First of all I didn't expect much of this movie. But I actually got surprised a little. The story is nothing special, but surprisingly, the acting is decent. Ted actually gave a good performance taking into account that he is not an actor and he is at his first ever movie. Decent action, but now I know Vince loves the superman gimmick a lot, and I do mean A lot, but this is a little to much, he breaks his arm, but still uses it, he survives an explosion and a mountain coming down on him. I know it might be just me, but i do think that hat pulls the movie down a little.Anyway, if you want a little entertainment on an afternoon, I recommend this movie, it works."
The Thin Red Line,1998,7.6,"Adaptation of James Jones' autobiographical 1962 novel, focusing on the conflict at Guadalcanal during the second World War.","The greatest fault of The Thin Red Line was its timing - it was released at around the same time as Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.  While most people dismissed The Thin Red Line as the `other' World War II movie of 1998, it's actually a very different kind of film - the film itself is not hurt by similarity to Ryan but was hurt commercially due to the misconception. It's easy to forget that Red was nominated for seven Oscars.  This is an extraordinary film that can stand well on its own next to Ryan.Saving Private Ryan was significant in that it visually depicted war in a realistic, gritty way.  The Thin Red Line's focus is more philosophical. It is about the contradiction between the beauty of nature and the destructive nature of men.  The movie cuts continuously between the external struggle of American GIs fighting to take a crucial hill from Japanese occupation on Guadalcanal - and more importantly, the internal chaos of war as every man tries to come to his own terms about matters such as morals, death, God, and love.Unlike in Saving Private Ryan, there is nothing patriotic about this movie. In fact, there probably has never been a more anti-war film.  The fighting men here are disillusioned, lost, and frightened.  They don't fight for their country or ""democracy"" - they fight because they have to.  The only priorities are survival, and - for the more humane - caring for their comrades.  Renowned composer Hans Zimmer - who won an Oscar nomination for his work-captures the grim mood perfectly and allows us to hear the men's thoughts.The characters are portrayed by a strong ensemble cast.  Acting is uniformly excellent, especially Nick Nolte as Colonel Tall, who is the unfeeling commander of the ground offensive on Guadalcanal. Thoroughly unlikable, he is the closest thing to a villain in the movie.  After studying war for an untold number of years, Tall sees Guadalcanal as his chance to prove himself and move up in the ranks - the men are only a tool to accomplish this goal and expendable.  In one crucial scene, he orders a captain (played by Elias Koteas, in another outstanding role) to lead his men to a frontal assault against a Japanese controlled hill.  When the captain suggests a more logical alternative, the colonel screams: ""You are not gonna take your men around in the jungle to avoid a goddamn fight!""  To this, the captain replies, `I've lived with these men, sir, for two and a half years and I will not order them all to their deaths.'  Later, when the hill is taken, he is dismissed of his duties as Tall sees him as a threat to the successful achievement of his goal.  Certainly, not every commander must have been that coldhearted and selfish, but surely some were, though not necessarily to that extreme.While the acting is very good, much of the cast is relatively unknown and it can initially be hard to distinguish the characters from each other as they may appear to be very similar.  They are all about the same age, have dirt smeared over their faces, and wear helmets and the same military garb. Also, the stars in this movie have very small roles.  George Clooney and John Travolta are credited with starring roles while really little more than extras - clearly for marketing purposes.  You will not see more than two minutes of each.One of the main themes of the movie is the contrast between nature and men's destructiveness in war.  The director, Terrence Malick, hired cinematographer John Toll to capture this on camera, and towards achieving that goal they couldn't have been more successful.  The almost surreal scenery is nothing short of stunning and has the same visual impact as any special effect.  The beauty of nature is always present, even when it is a setting for battle of destruction, and death.Though the battle scenes fall short of the frightening realism in Saving Private Ryan, they are heads and soldiers above every previous attempt. One truly gets the sense that war is a chaotic, often hopeless environment where it is only a matter of luck whether you survive or get killed.`How did we lose the good that was given us? Or let it slip away? Scatter it carelessly ... trade it for what has no worth?'  The film is filled with such poetic questions as to which there are no real answers.  This is definitely not a party movie.  There isn't anything uplifting about it - it is downright depressing.  Asides from entertainment value, however, this is a film that makes you think."
An Education,2009,7.2,"A coming-of-age story about a teenage girl in 1960s suburban London, and how her life changes with the arrival of a playboy nearly twice her age.","Sixteen year old ""Jenny"" (Carey Mulligan) lives with her aspiring, middle class, parents ""Jack"" (Alfred Molina) and ""Marjorie"" (Cara Seymour) whose only real desire in life is for her to study at Oxford University. This is and has been her sole focus throughout her childhood, until, that is - she encounters the dashing ""David"" (Peter Skarsgard). He's easily twice her age but is so much more stimulating than her schoolboy friend ""Graham"" (Matthew Beard). This isn't a sweep her off her feet relationship, he gradually engages her in conversation and finds they share common interests. He makes her feel special, interesting, grown up - and when he introduces her to his friends ""Danny"" (Dominic Cooper) and ""Helen"" (Rosamund Pike) she starts to feel like the proper fourth wheel on a social wagon that's truly exhilarating. Needless to say, her schoolwork starts to suffer - much to the chagrin of her teacher (Olivia Williams) and, like we all were at that age, there's no telling her that her short term path is not necessarily in her long term interests. As the film develops, we discover that though harmless enough, ""David"" and his pal are a pair of cads who make their living legally, but maybe just a little immorally - and when ""Jenny"" discovers that he has one whopping great (if predictable) skeleton in his closet, she has to put her new found maturity to good use. There's something very natural not just about Mulligan's performance here, but also about her burgeoning relationship with a man who knows just which buttons to press. He's not a nasty man, he has no agenda to get her straight into bed, indeed he seems just as dependent on having this young woman around to make him feel alive as she does him; and those characterisations proves quite effective. The star for me, though, was probably Molina. He portrays almost perfectly a father whose dreams for his daughter partnered with his own middle-class mores leaves him caught between his paternal instincts to protect his daughter and his ambitions that she live a better, more fulfilled, life than he. It does run out of steam a little at the end, but then again I'm not quite sure how I would have wanted it to conclude without copping out - one way or another, so maybe it is for the best. It looks classy, the 1960s cars, costumes and soundtrack see to that and it's well worth a watch,"
Easy Rider,1969,7.2,"Two bikers head from L.A. to New Orleans through the open country and desert lands, and along the way they meet a man who bridges a counter-culture gap of which they had been unaware.","I cannot overstate the importance of this movie in my personal development.In 1969 I was eighteen and a freshman at Cambridge University. I was also a near-fundamentalist and a member of the Christian Union. Its officials decreed that Easy Rider was unsuitable for Christian viewing; I'd seen some enthusiastic reviews which made me curious. Moral and spiritual dilemma followed. To view or not to view? I prayed about it - look, this is a long time ago, right - and decided that if it had been OK for the Christian Union's leaders to see it, if only to realise it was morally dubious, then it was OK for me. They hadn't been corrupted, presumably; the Lord would see that I wasn't either.So I went and it blew me away. I thought then and think now, that this is a magnificently perceptive commentary on hippie culture and one that only the medium of film can deliver. Naive idealism is weighed against the squalid reality of drugs (and indeed alcohol). Freedom is portrayed as often aimless, self-indulgent and downright boring. The underlying morality could be seen as puritanical: a celebration of the free-lovin' drop-out Sixties it ain't, more a weary end-of-decade critique thereof. I would have thought there was much to commend it to the Christian Union moralisers, yet as ever they couldn't see past the surface - drug abuse, loose women. Yet it has its high moments, in more ways than one, and is always a treat for the eyes.My decision to defy the Christian Union by seeing the film was an early step out of my fundamentalist prison and I haven't stopped walking yet. No-one's ever going to tell me what I can and can't watch again: nor will I censor anyone else's viewing. I'm still a believer, but not of the kind that the Christian Union would have thought will ever go to heaven. Guess I'll have to live with that."
Jobs,2013,6.0,The story of Steve Jobs' ascension from college dropout into one of the most revered creative entrepreneurs of the 20th century.,"Steve Jobs (Ashton Kutcher) is shown starting from his college drop out years in 1974 to working at Atari in 1976. He joins up with Steve Wozniak (Josh Gad) bringing Woz's computer to Homebrew. With Woz, they start Apple in his garage. Former Intel guy Mike Markkula (Dermot Mulroney) becomes their investor.I'm sure Steve Jobs fans have a thousand mistakes they like to point out and a thousand more complaints about his douchie portrayal. I have a more simpler complaint. This is no more than a simple made-for-TV movie. Ashton Kutcher is doing more mimicry than actually taking on the persona. I actually put most of this on the shoulders of director Joshua Michael Stern. There are too many Jobs speeches and pontifications. It's an easy way to copy Steve. Maybe it's too easy. It needs to go deeper."
Shadows in the Sun,2005,6.6,An aspiring young writer (Jackson) tracks a literary titan (Keitel) suffering from writers block to his refuge in rural Italy and learns about life and love from the irascible genius and his daughters.,"It is predictable, it has a lot of clich√©s, it doesn't aspire to be even nearer to what would be called a great film, or even a good one - or even a hit -, but its dialogues are fine and truthful, and reveal an experienced knowledge of a writer's craft and soul and suffering.As the comment above put it, it's a film of real people with real problems, apparently common and minor problems to the viewer who expects to extract some titillation out of films - the characters here are not involved in intrigues, in hiding a murder or escape from it -, but problems hard enough for those involved. As we learn somewhere: there is no order of difficulty in problems, one is not ""harder"" or ""bigger"" than another. They are all the same.The great psychologist Viktor Frankl, who spent four years in a concentration camp, tells in ""Man's Search for Meaning"", in an almost candid way, that his terrible sufferings there at the camp doesn't amount to anything bigger than anyone's. He makes a perfect analogy, and with the most frightening element an inmate of a concentration camp could think of: ""A man's suffering is similar to the behaviour of gas. If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly. Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore the 'size' of human suffering is absolutely relative"".Well, it seems a lot of thinking to draw from such an unpretentious film, but I think in that resides its merits. Keitel's outstanding performance adds a lot to it, it's on a level much higher than the whole production. It's amazing how great actors can have some of their great moments in lesser films, as Keitel here, or as Morgan Freeman unique, out-of-bounds performance in ""Street Wise""."
Life of Pi,2012,7.9,"A young man who survives a disaster at sea is hurtled into an epic journey of adventure and discovery. While cast away, he forms an unexpected connection with another survivor: a fearsome Bengal tiger.","The movie narrates an incredible story using the most beautiful special effects and great actors.It is more that a survival story and it is not about friendship. This story is about faith. Director Ang Lee use all the tools he have to make this movie about a solitary young man not a boring one. It is narrated by both, young Pi and the Adult Pi, it uses music all the time so there is not space for uncomfortable silents and the rhythm of the scenes is fast. The result a very entertained film.The most important thing of this film is it character. It is obvious because we are seeing for almost 2 hours just one character. So it is not only important to have a great character that appeals to the audience feelings, but to have an actor that portray this person the right way. Suraj Sharma was brilliant as Pi. He can make happy scenes as equal as sad, desperate, hopelessness, exhaustion and anger ones. Very few movies allow an actor represent so many emotions.But if Pi is a good character, Richard Parker can only be describe as unique. The tiger as personality of it's own. Not many films can make an animal with so many human features and yet never stop being a wild animal. This tiger is computed animated but the audience will barely notice, because the way it walks, eats, its factions, the eyes. It doesn't matter if it is computer animation, Richard Parker is alive and is his own character just as important as Pi is.If you think that ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" have good animal effects, you have to see how this people make a zebra, a hyena and a orangutan. All this, combine with a photography created by the same guy that make ""Tron: Legacy"" looks so cool and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" so beautiful, Claudio Miranda, makes it an incredible experience to see.This movie is definitely an Oscar runner for Special Effects, Cinematography, Director and Movie of the year."
Hotel Transylvania,2012,7.0,"Dracula, who operates a high-end resort away from the human world, goes into overprotective mode when a boy discovers the resort and falls for the count's teenaged daughter.","I did not know this movie was directed by Tartakovsky, which is probably why I liked it as much as I did. He is one of my favorite animation directors and he does a great job in directing this movie as well. The humor is a bit hit or miss, mostly kid-oriented but there were some creative jokes and I laughed out loud a couple times. The cast does a good job for the most part and the movie has some heart to it. Overall, a pretty pleasant surprise that could have benefited from some better writing."
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,2012,5.6,"After the birth of Renesmee/Nessie, the Cullens gather other vampire clans in order to protect the child from a false allegation that puts the family in front of the Volturi.","Reviewers say 'Breaking Dawn Part 2' received mixed reviews, with criticisms targeting the acting, especially Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, deemed lackluster. CGI effects, particularly for Renesmee, were often criticized as unrealistic. Pacing and plot issues were noted, with some finding the story rushed and shallow. Positive aspects included improved special effects, the soundtrack, and Michael Sheen's performance as Aro. The final battle and saga conclusion were appreciated by some, though others felt it strayed from the book."
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,2011,4.9,"The Quileutes close in on expecting parents Edward and Bella, whose unborn child poses a threat to the Wolf Pack and the towns people of Forks.","No matter what I or any one else say, there will be a lot of people who have already made up their minds on whether they are going to The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 and the most positive or negative reviews will never change that. Opinions between Twi-hards and Twi-haters are extremely polarised, but it is my duty to give an honest opinion on the latest chapter of the saga.It has finally happened. Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Bella (Kristen Stewart) have tied the knot and, despite some pre-wedding nerves, it seems like a success. The two lovers spend their honeymoon on a tropical island off the coast of Brazil and we get the moment we have all been waiting for: they finally have sex. But a shock is in store when Bella ends up pregnant (remember kids, always practise safe sex) and the human-vampire foetus is killing her from the inside. As the Cullens try to save Bella, the Quileute tribe set out to kill her and the child, believing it will be a threat and abomination. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) ends up being torn between his loyalty to the tribe, his hatred for Edward, and his love for Bella.There is a new trend in Hollywood to split book adaptations into two parts. It made sense with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, because that was a long novel with a many elements that were interlinked and it needed to be told in two parts, but ""Breaking Dawn Part 1"" was trying to stretch the material to fit the allocated time. There are numerous montages, such as the honeymoon, which could have easily been shortened to make a single, stronger movie. The film had very little plot too; it's basically about a complicated pregnancy that just happened to feature vampires and werewolves.There is a melodramatic tone throughout, amplified by the music, whether it was the piano-heavy soft moments, the epic score (often played over non-epic moments), or the emo rock songs. A little melodrama is fine, but it goes on for most of the movie, and when there is little hook of a story, it just becomes a drag. Even people who are fans to the series will admit that dialogue has never been its strong suit. Bill Condon attempts to make the sex scene and honeymoon to be tender, but it came off more sappy and overbearing.""Part 1's"" strength is that it is the best-acted of the series. Stewart certainly gives it a good go and Lautner gives what is a half-way decent performance. Pattinson was slumming it, but with some of the cheesy dialogue he has to say, even someone like Laurence Olivier would have struggled.Condon does have a few moments of visual darkness, including the dream sequence in the beginning with its juxtaposition of bright white clothing and blood and Bella and Edward standing on top of a load of corpses. The birth scene was actually intense and gory. But these are counter-balanced with goofy moments, one of the most infamous being a psychic werewolf argument.The whole wedding sequence and honeymoon plays like a young girl's fantasy, sort of idealistic. This is fine, but hardly dramatic and not likely to have wide appeal.Previous ""Twilight"" movies have had some interesting side issues that could and should have been explored. This is not the case with ""Part 1."" There are no issues of a man resisting his urges and dark side, a young teen forced into being a vampire, an army of powerful new vampires being formed and the idea of there being a vampire council. There is nothing like that. The few themes there are include a look into Edward's past, a brief debate about abortion and the idea of imprinting, which is basically brainwashing. A better idea could be looking at somebody forcing someone else to love them. That would be a dark story.""Breaking Dawn Part 1"" is the weakest movie in the series I have seen so far and I speak as someone who is neutral to the overall experience.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com"
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse,2010,5.1,"As a string of mysterious killings grips Seattle, Bella, whose high school graduation is fast approaching, is forced to choose between her love for vampire Edward and her friendship with werewolf Jacob.","movie was full predictable, you can tell the end after 30 min of viewing. i watched it at night and literally i was about to sleep ... i was hoping to see some good vampire/werewolf vs. vampire fight in the end but all i got was max. 15 secs of crap (trailer almost have all the imp scenes).and most SUCKing thing in the movie was Kristen Stewart's acting, her face remain emotionless in the entire movie ... widening eyes and opening mouth cant make you a good actor.WATCH TRAILER INSTEAD OF MOVIE .... its free and you can have more fun because they have added all the thrilling action in trailer."
City of Angels,1998,6.7,"An angel on Earth, a doctor unable to believe, a patient with a secret, a love story made in Heaven.","Overall, this is a nice love story that I enjoyed the first time I saw it but decreasingly so with future viewings. After three, it was enough, but that's two more than I usually watch of Meg Ryan films.Since it's Hollywood, you know there is going to be misguided theology, in this case the subject is angels and heaven. None of the ""sermons"" in here are Biblical, believe me. it's really more of a love story than anything else. Plus, it's an interesting story with good visuals.Nicholas Cage plays a likable guy. There are actually a few good messages about God and angels - mainly that they exist - and another good message being that all of us should appreciate more what we have here on earth, starting with our senses (smell, taste, touch, etc.)Anyway, if you like a good romance story, you should like this movie."
Cruel Intentions,1999,6.8,Two vicious step-siblings of an elite Manhattan prep school make a wager: to deflower the new headmaster's daughter before the start of term.,"This film (based on the 1988 hit 'Dangerous Liasons' starring Glenn Close, Michelle Pfieffer and John Malkovich) is a great movie intended for the older teenagers, and stars fine young acting talent.Rich kid Kathryn ('Buffy The Vampire Slayer's Sarah Michelle Gellar) bets her equally jaded step-brother Sebastian (Ryan Phillippe; 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', which co-starred  Sarah) that he can't seduce good girl, and virgin, Annette (played by Ryan's real-life wife Reese Witherspoon).Along the way, Kathryn tries to help sexually-inexperienced Cecile (Selma Blair) get some action in her life, while she starts screwing Cecile's ex-music instructor! Sound weird? It is. It's basically about 2 rich snobs who mess with the lives of those around them, just because their lives get boring.This film also stars Joshua Jackson ('The Skulls', 'Urban Legend', TV's 'Dawson's Creek) as Sebastian's gay best friend, who also gets involved in the use or be used storyline. Fellow teen-movie star Tara Reid ('Urban Legend', 'American Pie') also has a small role, as Sebastian's psychiatrists's daughter.This film is pretty intense and deals with sex, drugs, seduction and alienation in a brave, way that makes it appealing to all teenagers. Not for the light hearted, more daring than anything like 'She's All That' and 'Never Been Kissed', but it's still good fun!"
The Twilight Saga: New Moon,2009,4.8,"After Edward leaves because of an incident involving Bella, Jacob Black becomes her best friend. But what Bella doesn't realize is that Jacob also has a secret that will change their lives suddenly.","I too expected this movie to be better. I read the 4 books. The thing is they cut out the best lines from the books which can add SO much to the movies. I was looking forward to some seens in the movie: Edward proposal for Bella, when they talk while they are waiting to get out the Volturi, very romantic and whilte they are in plane going back home. I think the scenarist must be replaced or the writer should oversee the script. The only reason movies are hit cause of the books only. Most people who did not read the books did not like the movies. Hope they'll do better in the 3rd one. But I really hope they'll do much much better in the 4th movie cause this is the book I'd like most. In general, if you read the books you must watch the movies, its nice to have the characters & seens a life."
What Just Happened,2008,5.6,Two weeks in the life of a fading Hollywood producer who's having a rough time trying to get his new picture made.,"The film is certainly enjoyable, and has several laugh-out-loud moments. However, like the film within the film, What Just Happened? feels too long. As a filmmaker myself, I really enjoyed this film, but I am afraid that much of the appeal will be missing in a general audience. A producer trying to change Bruce Willis' mind is pretty funny, but how funny is it to a non-producer or a non-Bruce-Willis? The performances, are, of course, outstanding. The entire cast is composed of nearly uncriticizable actors who are superb in any role they attempt. If you have an interest in how films come to be, this is a fun little flick. If you don't care about the behind-the-scenes, you may want to sit this one out."
Tootsie,1982,7.4,"Michael Dorsey, an unsuccessful actor, disguises himself as a woman in order to get a role on a trashy hospital soap.","This is a wonderful film,I can't remember how many times I have seen it,I love it! Dustin Hoffman is brilliant as Michael Dorsey and Dorothy Michaels.Along with Jessica Lange and Teri Garr and fantastic direction from and co-star Sydney Pollack,this couldn't be any better.It's a great story and well scripted and very funny besides.If you love films you can't not love this one.This is my 2nd favourite film in the world  only because ''Some Like it Hot'' is my first choice.Dustin is one of the best actors in the business and continues to be to this day."
Mrs. Doubtfire,1993,7.1,"After a bitter divorce, an actor disguises himself as a female housekeeper to spend time with his children held in custody by his former wife.","MRS. DOUBTFIRE is easily one of the best movies ever made. Robin Williams makes audiences laugh and cry at his portrayal of a loving father who wants nothing more than to be with his children. After a painful divorce, he tries to gain custody of his children. This is the premise of the film. Along the way, of course, there are plenty of laughs, especially some great moments with Harvey Fierstein as Williams' brother and hair stylist. This film is so moving that it deserves to be seen by everyone."
Funny People,2009,6.3,"When seasoned comedian George Simmons learns of his terminal, inoperable health condition, his desire to form a genuine friendship causes him to take a relatively green performer under his wing as his opening act.","I'll admit I know this wasn't a typical Sandler movie as the near death experience added a bit of drama, and at first most of the characters were very likable and funny. Sandler kind of comes off as an ass at the beginning but then gets a little more likable as the movie progresses. There were many times where I laughed out loud at the jokes they made, and Sandler bantering Rogan was pretty hilarious. I thought to myself ""Okay, this is cute I like it."" BUT THEN! After the hour and a half mark hit, it's like the director said ""Hey let's throw as much useless crap on the end of this and hope it still stays funny!"" WHAT?! Why did Sandler have to go rehash stuff with his ex wife, why did he run around like a pussy for almost an hour and still not get the girl, and why did this movie drag on in no apparent direction for no apparent reason? After Sandler found out he was cured, that where is should've ended, right there and it would've been decent, but noooo! The director decides to torture us for almost another hour on random and unfunny garbage. After the first hour and a half, I started to really hate Sandler and Rogan's characters, they just came off as really annoying. So all in all the first hour and a half was funny, witty, and mostly cute, but after that just turn it off, you'll be glad you did!"
Planet of the Apes,2001,5.7,"In 2029, an Air Force astronaut crash-lands on a mysterious planet where evolved, talking apes dominate a race of primitive humans.","""Planet of the Apes"" (2001), despite its title, is not exactly a remake or sequel to the old ape movies from the 1960s-70s. So much of the plot is different, I see it more as a reimagining of the story.As far as this film goes, it isn't rated all that well. Additionally, the star, Mark Wahlberg, made public statements about how the studio ruined this film...mostly by giving the director Tim Burton impossible to meet deadlines...resulting in a rushed movie. You might want to know that I am a big fan of the original series...so impressing me won't be easy.Speaking of impressing....the ape costumes and makeup are insanely good. I thought they were CGI but when I read Rick Baker actually used practical effects to make the apes, I was shocked. It is really amazing...and it makes we wonder how the newer ape movies could be better...that is, for the male apes. The female apes look creepy and almost like an entirely different species. They could have used some work.The story is very different. It begins in 2029 on a space station. Captain Davidson (Wahlberg) goes out in a space craft during some weird space storm to retrieve a chimp astronaut (a 'normal' Earth-type chimp...not a scary one like you'll later see in the film). His ship goes out of control...flying through space and crashing on some planet controlled by apes.These apes manage to be even crueler and meaner than those in the original films...as well as acting more ape-like. Among them, the most ardently anti-human and evil is Thade...and after the Captain an some other humans escape from their incarceration, he's excited about how to use this not only to kill humans but gain power.So is this any good? Well, it's a heck of a lot better than the paltry 5.7 score it now has. It would have you think the film is very poor...and it certainly isn't. While I hate remakes and reimaginations, this one kept my interest and I enjoyed it very much. And, since the newer reboot is supposed to be better, the film has me wanting to see more.By the way, the very end scene is neat...and makes no sense whatsoever...one of the weakest parts of the story, actually."
The Weather Man,2005,6.5,A Chicago weatherman separated from his wife and children debates whether professional and personal success are mutually exclusive.,"I saw a screening of this tonight, and I was very impressed. I expected a rather shallow comedy, but instead, received a well-thought out and delivered work which was insightful, quirky, funny and touching film which was far above my expectations. Cage delivers a great performance as usual, and the father-son relationship between Cage and Caine was authentic and balanced. This is not just a comedy, but is a study of the importance of family, and an overlying existential questioning of what our lives are all about. I highly recommend it for men and women alike. On a side note... Verbinski's works are diverse, fun, and interesting, and this is no exception."
Vanilla Sky,2001,6.9,A self-indulgent and vain publishing magnate finds his privileged life upended after a vehicular accident with a resentful lover.,"This movie was so divisive. People either loved it or despised it. You can either accept the ending or you can't. The movie really makes you think and wonder, ""what's going on?"" You are not always supposed to know what is going on. A lot of people do not want to have to think too much lol. Great movie, good soundtrack. I love rarely when movies change the way you listen to a song. Good Vibrations by the Beach Boys came across in the moment as so eerie, I still think of that now when i hear it. It is a movie that is definitely worth watching."
The Fast and the Furious,2001,6.8,Los Angeles police officer Brian O'Conner must decide where his loyalty really lies when he becomes enamored with the street racing world he has been sent undercover to end it.,"Every summer a film comes around that takes everyone by surprise.  Last year it was Scary Movie and I'm sure in 1977 it was a film like Star Wars and then in 1981 it was Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Now I am not saying that The Fast and the Furious is in the same class as Raiders and Star Wars, just that it surprised everyone on the same level.  F&F is short on plot and dialogue and even some of the acting is lame, but what it is oozes is testosterone.  It pumps your blood, increases your adrenaline and attacks you with fast cars, sexy women and that one invariable that I think it has going for it... Vin Diesel.  There is just something about the guy, something that you really can't put your finger on, but he just has it. Maybe it is charisma, maybe it is charm, maybe it is just that he resembles some of the action heroes from the 80's with his chiseled triceps and his slabs of pecs.  Maybe it is all those things and maybe it is none of those things, all I know is that F&F is exactly what I had hoped it would be and nothing more.  This is the summer movie that I have been waiting for.  It's not that the films that have been out so far aren't that great because some of them are, it's just that this is the one that epitomises what summer as a teen ager is all about.  It is no wonder that exit polls for this film were around 65-70% under the age of 21.  And maybe that is why I enjoyed it so much.  I am pushing 30 but isn't it cool to lose yourself in a film that reminds you what it was like to be in highschool.  And isn't it cool to watch street racers break 140 miles an hour wile they shoot NOS through their vehicles?  Well isn't it?F&F doesn't contain any machinations similar to a film like Mission Impossible and it doesn't dazzle us with special effects of impending doom like Armageddon did, but it takes us into a world where people live life ""a quarter of a mile at a time.""Vin Diesel plays Dominic Toretto, a massive, bald mechanic that owns a garage but street races on the side to make some extra cash.  Paul Walker ( The Skulls, Varsity Blues) plays Brian Spindler.  He is a cop that has infiltrated the street gang to find out who is highjacking trucks and stealing all their merchandise.  There are about four rival street gangs in L.A. and one of them is pulling this off.  He has to figure out which one. Of course along the way he seduced by the life, but that is not what we really care about.  All we want to see is lots of racing, a few crashes, some fights and some sex.  F&F doesn't disappoint.  If what you have seen in the trailers of the film excites and entices you, then you know exactly what you're in for.  This is not going to win any Oscars for anything but what it will do is entertain you.  It will expedite you for 90 minutes into a world where Honda's are souped up to look like Dragons and junkyard scraps are rebuilt from scratch to be better than they were before, better, stronger and faster.  If this film appealed to you in the commercial, it will appeal to you on the screen.And of course there is Vin Diesel.  He first made a name for himself in Saving Private Ryan where he played Capparrzo.  Then he jumped onto the scene with his excellent and grandiose turn as Riddick in Pitch Black.  I think this is the film that got him noticed because no one had even heard of him before this.  Then he did Boiler Room and he showed a different side to him.  But F&F is all muscle and sheer bravado.  I think Vin is going to do great things in the years to come.  He is not a nobody anymore.  This film will take care of that.  And face it, isn't it cool to see the genesis of a new action hero?8 out of 10-  The ultimate summer rush!"
A Knight's Tale,2001,7.0,"After his master dies, a peasant squire, fueled by his desire for food and glory, creates a new identity for himself as a knight.","Brian Helgeland's A Knight's Tale is a hugely entertaining medieval romp set to modern rock classics such as Queen's 'We Will Rock You' and Thin Lizzy's 'The Boys are Back in Town'. The movie urges you to join in the fun with recognisable songs that is a jarring juxtaposition to the 14th century goings on at first but you soon get used to the idea.Heath Ledger is excellent as the peasant who wants to be a knight and, upon meeting a homeless writer, who turns out to be Chaucer, offers to forge papers so that Ledger can bluff his way into the annual jousting competition to prove his worth as a knight and finds romance along the way.This film has everything - action, adventure, comedy, romance and rock songs. It's feel good entertainment and Helgeland's unique approach still feels fresh, sassy and on point. Ledger is surrounded by a good supporting cast of Paul Bettany, Rufus Sewell, Mark Addy, Shannyn Sossamon and James Purefoy.It's the perfect mix of a smart witty script, solid acting and an off kilter approach that really works. Baz Luhrmann pulled a similar trick with both Romeo & Juliet (1996) and Moulin Rouge (2001) by mixing up period pieces with modern songs to serve the narrative in an unconventional way."
Shrek,2001,7.9,"A mean lord exiles fairytale creatures to the swamp of a grumpy ogre, who must go on a quest and rescue a princess for the lord in order to get his land back.","This movie really confronts the problems with society, such as the opioid crisis, domestic abuse, and donkey mistreatment head-on. It was a great way to talk about these issues with my teenage son."
Ocean's Eleven,2001,7.7,"Danny Ocean, a gangster, rounds up a gang of associates to stage a sophisticated and elaborate casino heist which involves robbing three Las Vegas casinos simultaneously during a popular boxing event.","Steven Soderbergh's remake of `Ocean's Eleven' is a stylish heist picture featuring some of the brightest stars in moviemaking today.  The cast includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and Matt Damon from the A-list, as well as such established veterans as Andy Garcia, Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner in there playing along with them.  Coming right off the heels of two highly acclaimed, award-laden serious dramas (`Traffic' and `Erin Brockovich'), it's understandable that Soderbergh might have been in the mood for something a little lighter in tone right about now.  Well, he has certainly found it with this property, which sails along smoothly like a well-oiled machine, with no angst-filled messages or heavy-handed themes to gum up the works.Taking the basic premise from the original 1960 film (which featured a who's-who of Hollywood stars of its own day), Soderbergh has updated it to reflect the advanced technological realities of the 21st Century.   In this film, recently paroled Daniel Ocean (Clooney) has decided to mastermind the robbing of not one but three major Las Vegas casinos all owned by the nefarious Terry Benedict (Garcia).  The rub is that Benedict has also recently added Ocean's ex-wife, Tess (Roberts), to his list of assets, which gives Ocean additional incentive to take Benedict for everything he's got. One of the amazing things is that the filmmakers use an actual casino as their target (the Bellagio) rather than devising a fictional one for their story's purpose.  One might think it could give certain audience members the wrong ideas.  Be that as it may, the director does a fine job exploiting the Vegas setting, taking us right into the heart of casino operations.A film like `Ocean's Eleven' stands or falls on the charisma of its stars, the intricacy of its plotting and the plausibility of its actions.  Luckily for the audience, the film pretty much succeeds on all three counts. Scenarist Ted Griffin does a fine job gathering together the men who will participate in the heist, allowing each a moment or two to define his character and to become part of the team.  The details of the plan itself are explained in very clear terms so that we rarely feel as if we are not able to follow the action.   There is even an inspired use of `Clair de Lune' near the end of the picture to lend an air of romanticism to the accomplishment, for who would deny that such large-scale thievery has often carried with it a certain element of idealism and romance?  After all, look how many books and films have featured robbers as heroes.  It perhaps explains why Tess can go from being a principled, law-abiding citizen at the beginning of the film to being an accomplice in crime at the end, all for the love of a man ¬ñ and we cheer her for it.Unlike in Soderbergh's other films, we do not find hidden depths lurking beneath the shining handsome surface of this movie, and we certainly carry no nutritious food for thought away with us from this film as we did from the others.  In fact, `Ocean's Eleven' is all ABOUT shining handsome surface and it makes no pretension of being about anything else.  It's cinematic junk food of the highest order, but, then, since when has junk food not been satisfying?"
Pearl Harbor,2001,6.3,A tale of war and romance mixed in with history. The story follows two lifelong friends and a beautiful nurse who are caught up in the horror of an infamous Sunday morning in 1941.,"I don't understand, why people are rating this film so bad. In my opinion its a good mixture between action and love story. Maybe a little bit more action. And in my oppinion a film hasn't to be 100% accurate, when it's enjoyable to watch it. If you want accurate things, then you have to watch some documentarys and not action films."
A.I. Artificial Intelligence,2001,7.2,"A highly advanced robotic boy longs to become ""real"" so that he can regain the love of his human mother.","The short review: if you're in the mood for E. T. then you will LOVE this flick. If you're in the mood for 2001: A Space Odyssey then you'll HATE it.Steven Spielberg, the director who brought us family-friendly scifi/fantasy hits like ""E. T."", Amazing Stories, and Raiders of the Lost Ark, inherited a project that was originally headed by chillingly cold scifi master Stanley Kubrick (2001 A Space Odyssey, Clockwork Orange). Spielberg delivered, 2 years after Kubrick's death, ""A. I."" The familiar two-letter acronym title ought to spell out for us the direction Spielberg chose to take with Kubrick's material. The result, as you might guess, is a very mixed bag of creepy disturbing brilliance and groan worthy Disney type stuff all jumbled together. Much like putting m&ms on a pizza, some elements should never be mixed.Plot: An artificially created robot child navigates the gauntlet of human cruelty while slipping into a Disney-esque subplot (literally Disney) of trying to find the Blue Fairy from the fable Pinocchio so she'll turn him into a real boy. You can practically skip the first half hour of this 2 1/2 hour movie because it amounts to a very predictable and irritating parade of scenes where the robot child is bullied for being a robot, despised by his apathetic 'father' and erratically loved/hated by his weak willed 'mother'. You can literally skip the whole string of clich√©s and you won't be missing anything. The movie starts to pick up after the 30 min mark when the child finds himself on the run.It picks up due to the excellent performance of Jude Law as ""Gigolo Joe"" a suave, charming, not-too-bright but very loveable cyborg prostitute. Jude plays the character with a very interesting spin: not a soulless hunk of lumbering metal like we've seen in all of our Hollywood robots but as an animated, cat-like, Gene-Kelley-Singin-In-The-Rain street dancer with a ton of personality and some great dance moves. I don't know if Jude won any awards for this performance but he really should have.Accompanying Jude's entry into the film, the story becomes considerably darker but not in a predictably melodramatic way like the first part of the film. Rather, we are immersed into a wonderfully nightmarish, satirical portrayal of human cruelty as we witness the renegade robots being subjected to a sickening carnival show in which they are mutilated in horrific ways to the rapturous applause of human crowds. Yes, it's disturbing but it's done with an air of dark comedy like in Terry Gilliam's masterpiece ""Brazil"" or in Veerhoven's ""Robocop"" or even Kubrick's own ""Clockwork Orange"".Unfortunately for the final 2 acts of the film we return to Disney territory as the robot child becomes obsessively (and quite stupidly, for an advanced computerized intelligence) rapt in chasing down the imaginary character from a Disney fable, that Blue Fairy. Complicating our enjoyment, there are at least 3 false endings where you feel like the story could've wrapped up on a poetic note, but it keeps going. By the time the real ending happens we're too emotionally exhausted to feel it.While being a failure on these levels, ""A. I."" is an absolute triumph in terms of special effects. The visuals were way ahead of their time in 2001, and they still hold up better than most big budget scifi films today, 20 years later. Unfortunately the delivery screams 1980s Spielberg (E. T.) and might leave you feeling very skeptical about the whole experience. Unless, like I said up front, you're in the mood for E. T. - in that case you'll have a wonderful time. But in either case we can only imagine how Stanley Kubrick had intended to approach his story as originally planned: an evolution of the deeply philosophical & abstract theme presented in ""2001"" about the newborn lifeform finding its footing in a dark and hostile human world."
Enemy at the Gates,2001,7.5,A Russian and a German sniper play a game of cat-and-mouse during the Battle of Stalingrad.,"I simply want to weigh in with a very positive response to Enemy at the Gates. Taken as a historical drama rather than an attempt to flawlessly depict an historical incident, this is topnotch entertainment. ""Enemy"" portrays the conflict between a young Russian sniper played by Law and the German sniper (Harris) who is sent to kill him during the German attack on Stalingrad during WWII. Apart from a scene which awkwardly caricatures the Russian field commanders and the occasionally distracting accents, the film successfully immerses the viewer in this tense war drama. Appreciate it it for its tight focus, uncompromising realism, and fine characterizations by the main actors. Research the historical accuracy later, if you must, but don't let it spoil the film."
Moulin Rouge!,2001,7.6,A poor Bohemian poet in 1890s Paris falls for a beautiful courtesan and nightclub star coveted by a jealous duke.,"You can't compare Chicago to Moulin Rouge, because they share, really, nothing besides the fact that people sing and dance. Moulin Rouge stands alone. I really love this movie.Nicole Kidman did sorta over act in parts (the Elephant scene, and when she tells Zidler she wants to leave.), but other than that, the acting is wonderful. I just love Ewan McGregor's character, and I love Ewan McGregor. John Leguizamo's character, Henri Toulouse Lautrec (yes, the famous painter), I found was just such an annoyingly funny character, he was definently one of my favorite characters. The Duke (Richard Roxburgh) is definently overacted, and frankly, Zidler (John Broadbent), is sooooo horribly annoying, you really would want to throw yourself off the Moulin Rouge windmill.I love this movie. There are some funny parts, but they are mostly just in the beginning, and the best musical number isn't 'Diamonds', but rather, the dramatic 'Roxanne'. Another one of my favourite pieces is 'Nature Boy', the song sung at the very beginning. It's so sad, but very touching.The beginning is sort of depressing, but it doesn't last long, so don't stop the DVD then. The middle sort of drags on, so be warned. The sets and costumes are beautiful, and very colourful, and the dancing is really Spectacular Spectacular (excuse the pun...), but long periods of time with the Bohemians, or at the Moulin Rouge can make you feel like you're stuck in a circus tent. But since Ewan McGregor's in it, I give it 10 stars."
Legally Blonde,2001,6.5,"Fashionable sorority queen Elle Woods follows her ex-boyfriend to law school, where she discovers that there is more to her than just looks.","Legally Blonde (2001) is a movie I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on Tubi. The storyline follows a California well to do lady that believes she is about to marry her high school sweet heart. Her sweet heart plans to become a lawyer in hopes of becoming a politician one day and she believes she would be the perfect wife to support his goals and ambitions. He doesn't and breaks up with her because he believes she doesn't take things seriously. She looks to prove him wrong by going to Harvard and getting her own legal degree but will that be enough to change his mind?This movie is directed by Robert Luketic (21) and stars Reese Witherspoon (Walk the Line), Luke Wilson (Bottle Rocket), Jennifer Coolidge (American Pie), Selma Blair (Hellboy), Victor Garber (Titanic), Ali Larter (Final Destination) and Linda Cardellini (Scooby-Doo).The storyline for this picture actually had more depth and better characters than I anticipated. The dialogue, interactions and circumstances are very smart and there's some good messages about not reading a book by its cover and labels. The comedic content is inconsistent but the movie unfolds well and is entertaining. There's a few aspects that were a bit much, but overall this is enjoyable. I would score this movie a solid 7/10 and recommend seeing it once."
The Princess Diaries,2001,6.4,"Mia Thermopolis has just found out that she is the heir apparent to the throne of Genovia. With her friends Lilly and Michael Moscovitz in tow, she tries to navigate through the rest of her sixteenth year.","I really enjoyed this movie. It was fun to see a fairly clean movie that was fun to watch. The acting of Julie Andrews and Anne Hathaway is superb and the story shines out hope. The director takes a very unlikely event and makes it believable, teaching us all something in the process. It was refreshing to see a teen film without all the sexual inuendos and crude language."
Scary Movie 2,2001,5.4,Four teens are tricked by a professor into visiting a haunted house for a school project.,"I have various mixed emotions about this sequel to the hit SCARY MOVIE. It wasn't as good but it delivered many laughs and slap-on-knees. I was a little surprised at this one on how they could spoof any movie right after the other. If you really liked the first one, you could be disappointed or satisfied with this one. I was satisfied. 7/10My MPAA rating: R for strong crude sexual content and humor, drug use and language."
Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,2001,6.8,"The comic ""Bluntman and Chronic"" is based on real-life stoners Jay and Silent Bob, so when they get no profit from a big-screen adaptation, they set out to wreck the movie.","While I found this movie amusing, if you haven't seen the entire Kevin Smith cannon, NOTHING is going to make much sense. Ben Affleck as more than one character, Jason Lee as more than one character, and the myriad of cameos from past Smith film characters would be confusing to anyone who doesn't know the history.A ""should see"" for Smith fans, but probably not much interest to anyone else."
Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,2001,5.8,"Adventurer Lara Croft explores lost empires and discovers immeasurable treasures in her daily life, but a secret from the past of her father, a missing archaeologist, will lead her to one of her greatest challenges.","I've watched this movie around five times in total now and every time feels like the first, it's a lot of fun. The ludicrous plot about the planets aligning always surprises me that's what the writers went with, as opposed to you know, raiding tombs?I watched the special features on the blu-ray and saw one of the creators make a statement that the film wasn't at all ""cheesy, corny or camp"" - did this guy watch the same version I did? The film is all of those things, from the opening scene in which Lara fights a training robot to then insert a mix-tape cassette, Lara's padded pointy breasts, and not forgetting the film ends on a freeze frame shot of Lara holding her guns - yeah not at all...If somehow you've never seen this film until today, don't take it at all seriously or you won't enjoy it, just switch your brain off and you'll likely get something out of it."
Spy Kids,2001,5.6,"Two kids become spies in attempt to save their ex-spies parents from an evil mastermind. Armed with a bag of high tech gadgets, Carmen and Juni will bravely crisscross the globe on a mission to save their parents and maybe even the world.","I really liked Spy Kids. I thought it was a very entertaining film, without taking itself too seriously. It was funny, intelligent and creative. What I mean by that, is that there is something for adults and older children as well as young kids. There was a fun script, that was intelligent and funny without being too artificial, and the direction from Robert Rodriguez was surprisingly effective. The plot is original, the thumb people were great fun, the action was fast-paced, the scenery was lovely and the special effects and stunts are splendid. And the soundtrack was awesome. The acting was very good, with Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara spirited in the two leads and their constant bickering was a delight. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino have fun as the parents, while Alan Cumming and Tony Shalhoub come close to stealing the film as Floop and Minion. The film also has a nice message; my only complaints are the rather over-emphasised ending, and I did feel that Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo didn't have enough screen time to shine properly but I did enjoy their brief appearances. All in all, a very underrated and fun movie. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
Thir13en Ghosts,2001,5.6,"When Cyrus Kriticos, a very rich collector of unique things, dies, he leaves his house, fortune, and his prized collection of ghosts.","The movie was fun. It wasn't a horrible flick my any means. The acting didn't make me want to leave, which is a definite plus for a horror movie. I thought the computer graphics were impressive. The ghosts were definitely freaky, and yes, I jumped a few times. I rarely jump in horror films, but this one I did...more than once.There were times where it was predictable however. This didn't take away from the entertainment factor though. I mean, this film isn't going to win any Academy Awards for best picture or anything, but it was a fun film. If you're looking for something to do this Halloween, take your friends out to see it."
Original Sin,2001,6.0,"A woman, along with her lover, plans to con a rich man by marrying him, earning his trust, and then running away with all his money. Everything goes as planned until she falls in love with him.","I have yet to find an actress as enchanting as Angelina. This film did wonders for me!! It was so primitive, sexual, intimate. BRAVO!! I would love to see Angelina in another film similar to this. It excited me the power of her lover over her when she seemed to be so calculating and strong.And the final truths that come out at the end...I watch this movie again and again, and it never ceases to animate me. An apt title, 'Original Sin'.The original sin of the woman as a seductress. Or perhaps, in the game of love, the original sin is to fall in love. I think that perhaps some of the comments posted about this movie are shallow. It's important to really watch this movie a couple times, and read between the lines."
Shallow Hal,2001,6.0,A shallow man falls in love with a 300-pound woman because of her inner beauty.,"Don't be confused by the subject matter of this comedy, this is a very touching movie.A Shallow man (Jack Black) is obsessed with only dating beautiful women, until he is hypnotised in to only seeing the inner beauty of people he meets. He then meets Rosemarie (Gwyneth Paltrow) and falls in loveThis was Jack Blacks first lead role. After roles in 'Cable Guy' and 'Enemy Of The State' and a very good supporting role in 'High Fidelity and he is perfectly cast as the title character. Until 'School Of Rock' two years later, this was his best performance. Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow seems to be having fun, and she looks great in a thong. However for me I would have preferred to see her in the fat suit more, to highlight what everyone else was seeing.... But I suppose you don't pay millions to have Gwyneth Paltrow in a movie, and have her hide in a fat suit for the majority of the movie.Jason Alexender is very annoying (as Blacks bitter best friend, who is annoyed at losing his wing man on nights out) and distracting with his bizarre hairline.It's silly if course (it's a Farrelly brothers movie) but it's also very very sweet!!"
Evolution,2001,6.1,Two college professors team up with a fire-fighting cadet and a government scientist to combat an alien organism that has been rapidly evolving since its arrival on Earth inside a meteor.,"When I first read about Evolution, the latest sci-fi scheme to come from DreamWorks, I was interested.  A story about aliens with humor, not bad. Then when I read that Ivan Reitman, the BEST comedic director of the 80's and one of the best of all time was at the helm, I was thrilled.  I mean, come on, after he was given duds like `Father's Day' and `Six Days, Seven Nights' to work with, isn't it about time that Hollywood gave him a project worth while (I won't even mention the bombastic disaster of `Junior'¬Öoh, I just did)?It begins with the introduction of Scott's character, Wayne Green, a wannabe fireman practicing for his fireman final (questionable at first, hilarious in the end).  Then he gets an unexpected visitor - a meteor, carrying alien organisms hits the heart of the Arizona desert. After a community college science professor, Ira Kane Duchovny, working with one screwed up screen name)and his eccentric geologist buddy, Harry Block (Jones) discover the meteor, they find that the `bleeding' rock starts to create these weird alien creatures and soon they begin to multiply.  Kane's nemeses, Gen. Woodman (Levine) and the military get involved, things get too out-of-control, so it's up to the teaming of Kane, Block, Green and government scientist Allison Reed (Moore) to stop the evolution.If you're a Reitman fan, the plot of this could make you go in expecting some kind of tribute to both `Ghostbusters'.  In a way it is, and is that a bad thing?  Hell no!  If you liked, or even loved (like me) `Ghostbusters', I can bet my clean pair of boxers that you'll get a hoot out of `Evolution'. But of course any film must maintain some distance from the films its being compared too, and `Evolution' does that.  The characters and situations are different, atmospherically.  Duchovny turns in a `cool' performance, by that meaning he wasn't Mr. Badass or Mr. Laugh-a-Minute, he was just, well, Duchovny and that itself is always pleasing to watch.  Jones is his usual funny self, delivering some funny lines. Moore's ability to do just about anything comes in handy here, playing the hottie-yet-clumsy love interest. Scott's acting resembles the other roles he's done in the past, and I've come to appreciate that (that thing he does w/ his eyebrow is getting funnier every time).  Can't say the same for Levine; his clich√© performance as the bad-guy-who-doesn't-listen character gets annoying fast.A lot of the film makes me question what it is, and really what it could have been.  The script, penned by three writers, was originally written as a sci-fi THRILLER, not a sci-fi comedy.  There were a lot of laughs, but because of the script's origin, there could have been more.  But considering the script was originally a sci-fi thriller, the filmmakers, including Reitman, did a great job.  Can't say much for the ending, though: the ending looks and feels like a meshed-up result of what-could-have-been, and from that mushiness, the filmmakers poked at and took at least some of the good elements.  Thank god the film is a comedy; if it was its original idea, the ending would have been disastrous.`Evolution' is a overall crowd-pleaser with nice special effects and makeup (those dead aliens looked great).  It's a few laughs and comedic situations short of comedic greatness, but look on the bright side-Reitman is back in his lovable kick-ass form.  He's tapped into the present and how most comedies are made, but he didn't dare forget his roots: there is a sequence in the film where Duchovny, Jones and Scott chase down a flying creature in a mall.  The three, equipped with shotguns, dispose of it in true Ghostbusters style.  And with me being a big Ghostbusters fan, I fell in love with the it, plus its the best scene in the film. (The trio singing after their battle; nice touch).GRADE: B+"
Bad Company,2002,5.6,"When an Ivy League-educated C.I.A. Agent is killed during an operation, the secret agency recruits his twin brother (Chris Rock).","When does a knighted actor collect a paycheck? When he acts benightedly in a cliched spy thriller that is a virtual textbook of Hollywood expectations, right down to the scruffy mid-eastern terrorists and the oversized red digital readout on a nuclear bomb.Anthony Hopkins plays a CIA veteran who must train a streetwise kid, played by Chris Rock, how to act like a real agent in 9 days. You can guess the outcome; in fact you can guess every scene before it unfolds. Movies like this make me know I couldn't do reviewing for a day job-I'd have to see bombs like this everyday.  Did I say bomb again?  Did we just have one come to America in `Sum of All Fears'?I am committed to saying something favorable for all movies if I can. Hopkins is always interesting to watch: he underplays here with a `sang froid' that would make Hannibal Lecter proud. The bad side of `Bad Company' is the bug-eyed, monotone, hysterical Chris Rock, who may have been medicated for this role because I didn't have to cover my ears this time-I just bore up under his boring delivery.Brooke Smith, who was the captured girl in `Silence of the Lambs', plays Hopkins' partner. `Lambs' this is not.The film moves rapidly enough for espionage junkies. There, I said 2 good things.  The movie still is `bad' company for the serious filmgoer."
Sweet November,2001,6.7,"A workaholic executive, and an unconventional woman agree to a personal relationship for a short period. In this short period she changes his life.","I thought Sweet November was an above average romance movie.  A few qualifiers are in order here.  First, I never saw the original, second, I normally do not care for romantic movies, and third, I am a big fan of Keanu Reeves. The reviews are quick to call Nelson Moss a self absorbed work-aholic. The movie does bring out a little of Nelson's past explaining how he feared he would end up like his father and the rest of the neighbors on his block. Combine that with the high pressure in today's society to get ahead, and you can understand why Nelson is obsessed with work.  Sara is very original and entertaining and makes you wonder if she's all there or what is she up to.  After almost 90 minutes into the film, you will see why Sara is the way she is and maybe enjoy the movie.  Keanu does a good performance with Nelson, creating a believable image of a single focused Ad Executive.  One can see many women saying ""typical male,"" and many men thinking of Nelson as a typical best buddy. As is true with many things in life, Nelson goes from one extreme to the other. In the end, Sara becomes his single focus in life. Trying to find the middle road is a central theme in many of Keanu's movie roles. I liked the acting in this film. It wasn't too dramatic nor was it bland. It was right down the middle."
The Mexican,2001,6.1,"A man tries to transport an ancient gun called The Mexican, believed to carry a curse, back across the border, while his girlfriend pressures him to give up his criminal ways.","A couple working on the give-and-take aspects of their relationship, an exquisitely crafted antique pistol with something of a diverse history and some questions concerning who is working for whom, all figure prominently in `The Mexican,' a black comedy directed by Gore Verbinski and starring Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt.  Jerry Welbach (Pitt), a somewhat less than astute young fellow in thrall to a criminal currently incarcerated, is given a seemingly simply assignment:  He is to go to Mexico, where he will rendezvous at a bar in a small town, at which time he will take possession of an invaluable hand-made pistol; he will then transport the item to the States and deliver it to his boss.  But there's a problem; his girlfriend, Samantha (Roberts) expects to go to Las Vegas at the same time, and their plans were already made and set in stone.  So what is a guy to do?  After Sam throws him out of their apartment and Jerry tries to explain-- in a memorable scene with her on the second story balcony, he on the ground looking up-- that if he doesn't do this job they will, well, KILL him, it doesn't make any difference.  After all, their trip to Vegas had already been planned, and he promised it would happen.  Talk about a guy between a rock and a hard place.  And it's only the beginning of a dark comedy of errors and circumstances that ultimately involves them with some double dealings and brings them into contact with a psychotic killer named Leroy (James Gandolfini). 	Director Verbinski lends a nice touch to the movie, eliciting noteworthy performances from his actors and establishing early on his method of using specific landmarks-- a traffic signal and a cross-roads in the middle of nowhere, for example-- that give context and definition to what is happening, sometimes off-screen (as in the opening scene, when you only `hear' a traffic accident that becomes a pivotal part of the story).  He avoids slapstick and plays up the natural, subtle humor that drives the film.  The characters are well drawn and the dialogue is clever and witty (`You ¬ëForrest Gumped' your way through this...') and often very droll.  And he maintains a pace and develops an atmosphere in which the unexpected can be expected that keeps it all moving along nicely and right on track.  And there's a politically incorrect sensibility to the movie that is refreshing to see; in real life certain situations and cultures that are foreign to us are often viewed in stereotypical terms, so there is no reason to portray it otherwise in a film, especially when care has been taken to present it in an inoffensive manner, as it is here. 	Taking on a decidedly unglamorous role, Roberts nevertheless creates a lively character with Sam, imbuing her with plenty of spunk and, of course, that trademark smile.  It's not a part that calls for a lot of depth, but she makes Sam likable and fun to watch, and she makes her banter with Jerry and Leroy credible and engaging.  Credit goes to Pitt, as well, for making the most of what is actually a leading man/character role; Jerry isn't the sharpest tool in the shed and he may be easily distracted, but-- like Sam-- he's not without some natural charm that makes him quite personable and interesting.  And there is a chemistry between the two that makes their relationship believable, especially when the sparks are flying.  Gandolfini, meanwhile, not to be outdone by his charismatic co-stars, makes an indelible mark as the sensitive, psychotic killer who turns out to be something of an enigma. 	The supporting cast includes Bob Balaban (Nalin), David Krumholtz (Beck), Luis Felipe Tovar (Luis) and Gene Hackman (Margolis).  A lively romp that takes some unexpected turns, `The Mexican' has a dark side, but manages to remain uplifting and thoroughly entertaining.  There's a natural flow to the film and the laughs, generated by both the situations and the characters, are never forced but prompted, rather, by the spontaneity of it all.  It's a movie that never pretends to be anything other than what it is, which is pure entertainment.  It'll leave you with a smile on your face, some chuckles and some great lines to quote.  And that, my friends, is the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10."
The Animal,2001,4.9,"After receiving organ transplants from various animal donors, a man finds himself taking on the traits of those animals.","Let me preface by saying I am a fan of Rob Schneider, and of Adam Sandler. I enjoyed Deuce Bigalow, and all (except for Big Daddy) of Adam Sandler's movies.  So I basically was expecting some (Ok, a lot) of low-brow humor, a decent plot to keep rolling through, and to laugh throughout the movie. This movie provided just that.  It wasn't the greatest comedy in the world, or a landmark motion picture, and it wasn't made to be that.  Colleen Haskell's skills at acting reminded me of when they put a ""famous"" non-actor on Saturday Night Live, and don't give them too much to do in the skits. She's only in the movie probably a total of 15 minutes, but does what they ask of her, and does a decent job of it.  The movie is a hoot, and doesn't actually stoop to every joke being a f**t joke.  I laughed about every 3-4 minutes, and enjoyed the ending as well.  If you're expecting something similar to Deuce Bigalow, you won't be disappointed."
The One,2001,5.9,"A rogue Multiverse agent goes on a manhunt for alternate versions of himself, getting stronger with each kill. Only the last version of himself, an LASD cop, can stop his crusade before he becomes ""The One"".","Jet Li has been able to come out with some good action movies like ""Romeo Must Die"", and ""Kiss of the Dragon"", but there is no doubt this has been his best movie so far.  I absolutely love the plot for this movie.  It's sci-fi, it's action, and above all it's pretty original.  Jet Li is the best martial artist in the world.  The actual fight scenes in Kiss of the Dragon may have been better, due to the fact little to no CGI's were used, but The One is a much better movie overall.  What makes this movie work even more is the great selection of music.  How can it get better than seeing Jet Li kick the not out of people while Drowning Pool's ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" is playing in the background?  Other artists in the movie include Disturbed, and Papa Roach so you can get a pretty good idea of what the fight scenes are like. This isn't a best picture, though I'm surprised it wasn't nominated for effects.  But in an overall enjoyment grade, I'd say this was one of my five favorite movies of 2001."
Cats & Dogs,2001,5.2,"A look at the top-secret, high-tech espionage war going on between cats and dogs, of which their human owners are blissfully unaware.","This was a pretty clever film mixing live characters and human voices for the dogs and cats. The dubbing is extremely well-done, and so is the humor. It's a funny story, although it displays the typical whacked-out father, which is another political correctness feminist agenda (mother = good; father = bad). Other than that, it is a very entertaining film even with a bunch of silliness.Check the cast out. How often to you see Susan Sarandon and Charleton Heston in the same movie. Now THERE is diversity, even if it's only their voices!People here complain the film is too much for kids, and not adults. Well, isn't that terrible? Imagine the nerve of these filmmakers, doing something just for children!"
Ali,2001,6.7,"A biography of sports legend Muhammad Ali, focusing on his triumphs and controversies between 1964 and 1974.","He ' floated like a butterfly and stung like a bee' and the world says he was the 'greatest'. Of course I am talking about Muhammad Ali, the world's most famous boxer. The movie to celebrate his life was an exceptional piece of cinematography. With an outstanding cast and hypnotic story, 'Ali' brings to life the controversial and popular boxer that we all love. This movie can be enjoyed by anyone, whether they like boxing or not.The Champ Is Here! With wit and athletic genius, with defiant rage and inner grace, Muhammad Ali forever changed the American landscape. Fighting all comers, Ali took on the law, conventions, the status quo and the war - as well as the fists in front of him. Ali both ignited and mirrored the conflicts of his time and ours to become one of the most admired fighters in the world.What an unbelievable role, by Hollywood superstar, Will Smith. He was fantastic in the role of Muhammad Ali. The work that he must have had to put into become 'Ali', would have been so grueling. I remember reading that Smith had to go through heavy amounts of boxing and weight training, to feel like a boxer, and then also look at Ali as a youngster from footage, and then become him. That he did, in only the way that Will Smith can. He was so good that the academy saw the role to be worthy of an academy award nomination. It was a shame that he did not win it.The other roles in this film were also of a high quality. I found Jon Voight's role as the outlandish sports commentator, Howard Cosell, to be brilliant. At no stage can you pick that it is him. I am sure that what we see of Cosell, from Voight, is the true man of the time. It was also interesting to see Will Smith's real wife, Jada Pinkett, in the same movie. She was good as one of  Muhammad's love interests.The story to this film was interesting, as it had many fascinating facets to it. I found the way that we see Muhammad's interaction with the many women in his life to be written and portrayed well. I also enjoyed the way that Ali stood up for himself outside of the ring, with a poignant time in the film being when Cassius Clay rejects serving in the US army to fight in the Vietnam war. In addition to the fighting scenes that were interweaved brilliantly, to help balance this film's story. A lot of the praise must be given to the main man behind this film, director Michael Mann. He did an amazing job bringing 'Ali' to life. He was also a producer and a writer, so he had a big role in making 'Ali' the film it was.Also having real boxers appear in this film, made the movie all the more enjoyable, as you believe the fighting is real. In fact the boxing scenes in this film, are of the finest quality. Will Smith put a lot of himself on the line, by really fighting as a boxer. He was up against fighters such as Malick Bowens, Michael Bentt, James Torney, Alfred Cole and Charles Shufford. I am certain that these men could pack a good punch, so Will was very willing to put his health on the line to make this film 'believable'.I must make mention of what a personality Muhammad must have been. He was very opinionated, but also stood up for what he thought was true. I remember one comment about Ali being that he was 'a loud mouth', and that was so true. I mean the way that he must have fired up his opponents before a fight,  by his blind arrogance is truly amazing. Again praise must be given to the way that Will Smith captured Ali's personality, to be really coming 'the greatest'. It is a shame that Muhammad's life has been affected by the horrible 'Parkinson's disease'. Yet I am sure that he is giving a great battle against this.Ali is another film based on a true story, with a role that one performer makes his own. Smith is now in the class of actors such as Jim Carrey who became the crazy Andy Kaufman, Denzel Washington who became Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, the fine role taken on by Academy Award winner Hilary Swank, who became the controversial figure of Teena Brandon in 'Boys Don't Cry' and Julia Roberts, who was Erin Brockovich, in one of the best performances of her career. This role was great from Smith, as it can and will show many people of my generation how great a legend Ali really was and is. This movie gives us all an important lesson. That we can be anything we want, against adversary and for the only person who counts - that being you!CMRS gives 'Ali': 4 (very good film)"
Kate & Leopold,2001,6.4,An English Duke from 1876 is inadvertently dragged to modern day New York where he falls for a plucky advertising executive.,"Honestly, my wife rented this and I wasn't planning on watching - but the luscious cinematography and some interesting writing drew me in.  Hugh Jackman sealed the deal with his totally straight portrayal - this guy's earning power can only go up!  Looking for some fluff and a laugh? It's better than most of the romantic comedy crap out there.  Not a waste of time if you are in the mood to have something wash over you."
Sammy 1,2010,6.0,"A sea turtle, who was hatched in 1959, spends the next fifty years travelling the world, while it is being changed by global warming.","My 5 year old wanted to watch this movie. She spent much of the movie crying. Most kids movies have some type of obstacle for the main character to overcome and then they come out on top. Sammy encounters more obstacles than most. The majority of this movie is just one sad, scary thing happening after another (difficult for some children to deal with). I thought the graphics were great even though I didn't watch the 3D version. I think the movie was okay, but it dragged quite a bit. It's not one of those movies that my child will want to watch again and again and again. If you're looking for a completely light and happy children's movie to watch you may want to look elsewhere."
Sahara,2005,6.1,"Master explorer Dirk Pitt goes on the adventure of a lifetime of seeking out a lost Civil War battleship known as the ""Ship of Death"" in the deserts of West Africa while helping a WHO doctor being hounded by a ruthless dictator.","i didn't mind this movie.it's pretty lite fare,but enjoyable.the movie is based on a novel by Clive Cussler and centers around thrill seeking adventurer Dirk Pitt(Matthew McConaughey)and his travelling companion(Steve Zahn).the duo find themselves in over their heads and trying to avoid being killed by enemies they have made on their latest treasure hunt.they end up teaming with a humanitarian aid doctor,played by Penelope cruse.McConaughey and Zahn make a good pair,and work well off each other.they each have some funny lines.cruse was OK,though i am not a fan of hers.the movie is fast paced and has some thrills.it's funny at times,but it is also unrealistic to the point of absurdity.my eyes got a workout from rolling back in my head so much.also the movie feels incomplete somehow.there was great potential and i think they could have made a great movie.nevertheless,for mindless entertainment,you could do worse.for me,Sahara is a 6/10"
Osmosis Jones,2001,6.3,"A policeman white blood cell, with the help of a cold pill, must stop a deadly virus from destroying the human they live in, Frank.","Osmosis Jones is a comedy of human proportions, I guess.  It works enough and when it works well it's a good movie.  Although when you think about it the plot-line inside Frank's body (frank is played by Bill Murray with no shame in great form) is rather routine and for me was the only thing keeping this from being really good.Still, it might be a worthwhile movie, more for kids than adults, but it it watchable for all.  Various voices include Chris Rock, Brandy Norwood, Laurence Fishburne, David Hyde Pierce and William Shatner.  Pleasant most of the way and sometimes cool.  B"
Knight and Day,2010,6.3,A young woman gets mixed up with a disgraced spy who is trying to clear his name.,"I mean this movie was never going to win any awards, but that doesn't mean it's not a hell of a good time. Cruise is at his charismatic best, and he shows off some genuine comedic chops. Diaz is a charming and funny co-star. This film is great because it feels light on its feet. It's fast-paced, funny, action packed, and doesn't get bogged down in weighty, manufactured drama or overly convoluted plotting. Knight and Day achieves what it set out to do, and that's why I like it."
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,2007,6.5,Benjamin Gates must follow a clue left in John Wilkes Booth's diary to prove his ancestor's innocence in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.,"There are a select few individuals out there that seem to garner everything they know about life from movies, be it political viewpoints, philosophy, etc. and find it objectionable when a movie is produced purely for entertainment purposes. I can't speak for everyone, but as for myself, I don't want to have to pay to have yet another political viewpoint shoved down my throat (CNN/Foxnews broadcasts 24/7 for that), or to be beaten over the head with with the life philosophy of some bazillionaire producer/director that lives in the Ivory Tower that is Hollywood. I can read Zarathustra, the Tao Tse Ching, or even the Bible for that.When I go to see a movie, I just wan to be entertained, and National Treasure BoS delivers there. Not the best movie I have ever seen, but it was an entertaining escape from reality for two hours and that it was I pay my money for. For me, the best part of the movie wasn't Nic Cage. He has done so many movies, it seems like he has gotten to the point where he is just punching the clock. He doesn't stand out on film, but he isn't horrible either and that is what we get from him here - a very pedestrian workmanlike performance. I would like to think he has another touchstone performance in him like the one he gave in ""Leaving Las Vegas"", but if he can still keep getting several million per movie just being average, why put in the effort. Diane Kruger was also pretty average. She shined in the first movie, but not so much here.For me, John Voight, Justin Bartha and Helen Mirren were what made the movie good. John Voight was great. His character was both funny and endearing and the synergy between him and Mirren was palpable. Mirren showed once again why she is arguably the best actress in the business. Justin Bartha was a scene stealer and had some of the funniest lines (along with Voight)."
Commando,1985,6.7,"A retired Special Forces colonel tries to save his daughter, who was abducted by his former subordinate.","The retired Special Forces Colonel John Matrix (Arnold Schwarzenegger) lives a calm life with his beloved daughter Jenny (Alyssa Milano) in an isolated house in the woods of a mountain. One day, his mentor Major General Franklin Kirby (James Olson) visits him and tells that the men he had trained for his unit are being killed and he leaves two soldiers to protect Matrix. However the helicopter of General Kirby has been followed by hit men that abduct Jenny and Matrix. Soon Matrix learns that Bennett (Vernon Wells) that belonged to his unit and was presumed dead is the responsible for attack to his house. Further, Bennett was hired by Arius (Dan Hedaya), a former president of a South American country that Matrix had overthrown. Now Arius wants Matrix to assassinate the president of his country in order to assume the position again otherwise he will kill Jenny. Matrix is forced to embark in a flight to the country with one of Bennett's thug while another one, Sully (David Patrick Kelly), will confirm that Matrix is in the flight. However Matrix manages to kill the thug and leave the plane and has eleven hours to save Jenny. He convinces the flight attendant Cindy (Rae Dawn Chong) to help him to save his daughter.""Commando"" is another great action movie from the 80's, maybe the best decade in the cinema history for this genre. The screenplay has non-stop action and funny and unforgettable moments. My favorite is when John Matrix tells to Sully that he likes him and he will be the last one to die. Soon he corrects, saying ""I lied"". I did not recognized Alyssa Milano, from ""Charmed"", in her second role as Jenny. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Comando Para Matar"" (""Commando to Kill"")"
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,2005,6.5,"A husband and wife struggle to keep their marriage alive until they realize they are both secretly working as assassins. Now, their respective assignments require them to kill each other.","Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a story of a husband and wife who are working as assassins, unbeknownst to each other, and not surprisingly, are in therapy to save their marriage. Ironically, they both believe their lives together are too boring.John Smith (Brad Pitt) meets Jane (Angelina Jolie) while both are in danger of being exposed in a foreign country, while working. They are both experienced assassins at the time and go with the flow, and eventually falling for each other. Neither tells the other what they actually do for a living.Needless to say, they find each other out and both agencies who they work for, give the order to kill the other within 48 hours. Thus, the hijinx ensue. Both are vying for control and to discover how much the other actually knows. Upon finding that they both know everything, a full on mini-war begins.This movie has a little bit of everything. The Smiths are not without their humorous sides, especially Brad Pitt. Also, there are a few good fight scenes, between The Smiths along with some others. There are a few nice weapons to be admired here, as well as some very nice eye candy (I am talking about Miss Jolie, but I hear the ladies are fond of Brad, also). Also, I would like to give an honorable mention to Vince Vaughn as Eddie. I feel his performance was funny, but too small for this movie.This movie is a fun little romp through the house with some nice action scenes. Recommended if you would like a somewhat toned down True Lies. 8/10"
The Family Stone,2005,6.3,"An uptight, liberal businesswoman accompanies her boyfriend to his eccentric and outgoing family's annual Christmas celebration and finds that she's a fish out of water in their free-spirited way of life.","The Family Stone (2005) surprised me in a very good way. All of the actors did very well with the script and with both the funny and dramatic scenes. Sarah Jessica Parker earned a golden globe nomination for this movie, very well deserved! Sarah nailed both her dramatic and humorous dialogue in the various scenes. Of course Diane Keaton did very well in her own character, along with Craig T. Nelson (Poltergeist). Rachel McAdams did a great job as well, and Claire Danes was my favorite character in the entire movie. The script, storyline, and dialogue between characters was all very sharp and well written in my opinion. This movie actually has some pleasing surprises and twists that you definitely do not see coming, at least I didn't! Overall this is a fun, entertaining, funny, dramatic, well acted, and well written holiday film that will warm your heart and for sure make you laugh! 7/10 for The Family Stone."
Domino,2005,5.9,A recounting of Domino Harvey's life story. The daughter of actor Laurence Harvey turned away from her career as a Ford model to become a bounty hunter.,"This was a pretty good action movie which I believe could have been better if the director (Tony Scott) hadn't kept cutting away to one scene after another. In my opinion this technique didn't help to enhance the film at all. If anything it gave it a choppy feel. Other than that though I thought the acting was really good. I enjoyed seeing Jacqueline Bisset (as ""Sophie Wynn"") who still looks like dynamite. Mickey Rourke (""Ed Moseby""), Edgar Ramirez (""Choco"") and Delroy Lindo (""Claremont Williams"") also performed quite well. Additionally, Keira Knightley (as ""Domino Harvey"") was excellent but it was Christopher Walken who was nothing less than sensational as the television producer named ""Mark Heiss"". He definitely gave this film an extra edge. At any rate, if you're wanting a good movie with plenty of action and humor then this is one you should definitely want to check out. I honestly think you'll like it."
Valkyrie,2008,7.1,"A dramatization of the July 20, 1944 assassination and political coup plot by desperate renegade German Army officers against Adolf Hitler during World War II.","I'm appalled at the way the specialized and not so specialized media attacked Tom Cruise for this movie. Why? He's not just good but very good in his against type performance. I've heard critics calling him ""distractingly bad"", how ridiculous and nasty. The film by the great craftsman Bryan Singer is a suspenseful, beautifully made historical thriller with a remarkable attention to detail. In an effort to be accurate the Jews are never mention because in fact the attempt to assassinate Hitler had nothing to do with that. The real reason? The war had turned against the Germans, it was clear that they were entering a down spiral and Hitler's madness was at the center of that. Regardless of the fact we know how the story ends, the movie manages to be a gripping tale based on real events. Well done Mr.Cruise, you won! Your Valkyrie is performing stupendously at the almighty box office."
Wild at Heart,1990,7.2,Young lovers Sailor and Lula run from the variety of weirdos that Lula's mom has hired to kill Sailor.,"A real stimulatingly offbeat exhibition from Lynch is the dark and wild backdrop of a romantically engaged traveling pair: ""Sailor"" who is on parole after committing a brutal murder, and ""Lula"" whose mother demands her to return from a spoiled trip to Texas with help from a detective. It's a twisted, artsy journey that is often repulsive and long to boot (and certainly not for the squeamish!), but fares inventive at a certain degree and boasts some of the strongest performances ever worked on a Lynch film, perhaps even in 1990. Cage's concert act and the magically rendered semi-ending are two classic acclaims put together in this moving cinematic collage.RATING: * * *"
The Mirror Has Two Faces,1996,6.6,"A shy, middle-aged professor enters into a romantic but non-physical relationship with an unlucky-in-love colleague.","Indeed, I am greatly inspired by Rose's transformation, as I myself have never imagined that anyone may consider me beautiful, nor attractive in any manner. Until recently I have found myself to be rather plain, and yet, once noticed, have understood what the character of Rose may have felt. The music in the film is truly inspiring as well, and Barbra Streisand's singing is, as usual, wonderful. I do wish that she would do another film like this...and perhaps even with Jeff Bridges. It would be nice..."
Diana,2013,5.6,"During the last two years of her life, Princess Diana embarks on a final rite of passage: a secret love affair with Pakistani heart surgeon Hasnat Khan.","Entering the cinema auditorium with a pre-conceived pessimistic judgment on the film yet determined to watch it anyways, I can only say that I am glad that I had not allowed for media and critic opinion to dissuade me from watching ""Diana."" The film does not portray Diana in a bad way at all. If anything, it reiterates the absolute disgusting habits our press have had in terms of absolute disregard and disrespect for people's privacy. You feel a certain connection with Diana throughout the film, and see her for the ""normal person"" she was deep down. Naomi Watts' performance was spectacular, and she certainly did Diana justice. Although the film is most certainly disliked by many - i.e: the media, Islamophobes and daily mail readers... It is disliked for the mere fact that the film provides an insight into things that make certain people very uncomfortable, such as the prospect of the Princess of Wales marrying to a Pakistani Muslim, and the fact that Diana was actually a human being, with feelings, and with a difficult life.So all I can say is, ignore the media, and make judgements for yourself. Perhaps after watching the film, you would rate it as highly as I have, or perhaps you may walk out half way through... Regardless, it's a fantastic film with a beautiful portrayal of the 'People's Princess'... Be warned: Take some Kleenex with you...The ending... is rather emotional"
What to Expect When You're Expecting,2012,5.7,"Follows the lives of five interconnected couples as they experience the thrills and surprises of having a baby and realize that no matter what you plan for, life does not always deliver what is expected.","Contrarily to this adapted verbose title, one shouldn't 'expect' much that is, unless literary desecration is in your hand of cards--if that is the game you're looking to play, then consider this mess a winner.Inspired by Heidi Murkoff's multimillion-selling-self-help-book for expectant mothers--holding the same name--'What to Expect', the film, will be much less prolific. Obviously a lot more work, and money, towards getting an ensemble cast--as opposed to garnering producers with emphasis on purpose and ingenuity--the filmmakers, here, create a product that is not the least bit unique it's a generic label laden with followed genre-specific clich√©s, bawdy humor, and disjointed direction.Despite its few laughs, known cast, and affecting hints towards pregnancy, 'What to Expect' is an over-packed piece of ""luggage"" that becomes too frustrating to haul around. An immersion too tediously futile and not nearly enough funny. Expect worse..."
Housesitter,1992,6.2,"Con artist Gwen moves into Newton's empty home without his knowledge and begins setting up house, posing as his new wife.","I loved reading the reviews of this lovely movie. Its a quaint, almost old fashioned film. The kind of film you loved with people like Cary Grant and Doris Day etc. Its genuinely funny. The chemistry with Martin and Hawn is perfect and its a pity they did not do more together. Goldie is a great talent and you really find her so adorable. Steve Martin needs a good actor to bounce off. I always preferred him in stand up but in this with Goldie he is wonderful. The chemistry between Martin and Goldie has not been repeated and thats a shame. Its very rare to find it in a modern film. There is one scene I find hilarious. I laugh myself silly every time I see it and thats the scene when Martin sings for the old soldier ""Tooraloohraloora"". I don't know why I find it so funny but I think its one of my favourite moments in a film. I wont explain the details as it would ruin it for people who have not seen the film but its side splitingly funny. There are plenty of nice moments in the film. Oh and I LOVE the house!!"
Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,1988,7.4,Two con men try to settle their rivalry by betting on who can swindle a young American heiress out of fifty thousand dollars first.,"How on earth did this movie get a 6.7 on the ratings scale? Read the comments, this is one of the funniest and most intelligent comedies ever, remake or not. When you can watch a film 20, 30 times and still find it funny 15 years after it was first released how is that not a classic?"
The Bone Collector,1999,6.7,A quadriplegic ex-homicide detective and his partner try to track down a serial killer who is terrorizing New York City.,"An extremely overlooked film in my opinion. Yes, Se7en and Silence of the Lambs absolutely annihilate this, but for a 90's detective case it's rather compelling. This is what happens when you cast two great leads, a decent film is produced. Much like any other serial killer story, our main characters must find out who the homicidal maniac is before they kill again. The difference is, the forensic expert is paralysed and so he trains an unwilling rookie to solve the case. Murder case aside, it's all about passing on knowledge and skills to another peer in order to complete a task. Rhyme is unable to do anything, so he envisages his own image within Amelia. Turning her from a rookie cop to the perfect forensic investigator. Highlighting the importance of communication and trust. Fortunately Washington and Jolie have decent on screen chemistry. Both their talents put together to create an explosion of raw acting. Jolie plays a tough yet vulnerable officer, Washington juxtaposes this with an experienced performance. The two amalgamate to create the perfect crime solving entity. The crime scenes themselves were visceral and not easy watches, particularly being scolded to death by oncoming steam. I loved the gritty realism that is sustained throughout. It evokes a sense of mystery, we are attempting to solve the case with the characters. Supporting cast were good, nothing outstanding. Although I wanted more Queen Latifah! The killer's reveal was a letdown unfortunately. The final twenty minutes were rushed to what was an intelligently paced thriller. And thank God we don't have those horrible slow motion frames that were all so apparent in the 90s...just hideously generic. The Bone Collector is a damn good watch, and for any Washington or Jolie fans you are in for a great time."
Equus,1977,7.1,A psychiatrist attempts to uncover a troubled stable boy's disturbing obsession with horses.,"Richard Burton gave his finest performance in this adaptation of the Peter Shaffer play about a psychiatrist (Burton) who must unravel a mystery surrounding the blinding of a number horses from a young boy,played to perfection by Peter Firth. The film loses the play's theatricality immensely, but the performances in the film are so incredible all around that none of that will matter. Joan Plowright stands out as the young boy's mother. Burton and Firth were Oscar nominated."
Roxanne,1987,6.6,The large-nosed C.D. Bales is in love with the beautiful Roxanne; she falls for his personality but another man's looks.,"I do not routinely enjoy Steve Martin, but was extremely impressed with the sensitivity and deftness with which he played Cyrano de Bergerac in modern guise. There is nothing archaic or stilted about the script, yet it is surprisingly faithful to the character of the original play (which in turn is closely based on Cyrano's true history). Numerous scenes - including most of the best ones - are lifted almost intact from the Edmond Rostand play, but a viewer who is unfamiliar with that source probably will have no idea which scenes they are. The poetry, imaginative spark and romantic instincts of the original play are handled lovingly and with finesse. Daryl Hannah is just right as a thoroughly modern Roxanne, willingly surprised to find that there is still romance in the world. You do not have to be familiar with the source to enjoy this witty, satisfying, and very funny movie - but if you are, you will enjoy it all the more.Note added 2015: When I first wrote the above in 1999, Steve Martin had not yet done most of his (in my view) best work; but I still go back to this as my very favorite of his performances."
Dune,1984,6.2,A Duke's son leads desert warriors against the galactic emperor and his father's evil nemesis to free their desert world from the emperor's rule.,"Say what you will about incoherence, this is more sensuous than any Star Wars. In fact, it is the most expensive 'tripping' ever produced in film - though far from the most satisfying.It helps to know the book and forget it as you watch this. Not being familiar with the book, you're left with a disjointed tapestry of weird costumes and special effects, some of them impressive, but if you are, and don't have to burden yourself with following the constantly clumsy explanation of the multifaceted Dune universe, you can enjoy this as illustration of a few core ideas.Herbert's novel was the product of strange and powerful times. The US public was experiencing the Civil Rights upheaval, its short-lived infatuation with Islam and meditation, and the same year as the book came out, LSD had spilled out of some top-secret government labs into the streets and youth culture of San Francisco. The first satellite images of Earth had just been published. The Black Panthers had entered the vernacular.So all the stuff about prescient visions, mentats and mastering mind, (herbally) expanded consciousness as the tool to the navigation and 'folding' of space, Herbert wrote with one eye on the Jordan Belson, Beatles and Maharishi crowd - the generation between film noir and Lucas that for a brief time projected truths into constructed cosmologies.Herbert was more erudite than most. But he was caught under the same spell - the expectation of a noble jihad of the people and wise lamas from the East coming to teach 'the way'. And you can tell that he was exposed to Eastern thought through Jungians, by his laboriously constructed mythology and (now trite) focus on a Chosen One's journey.Lynch was a late bloomer in that scene. To my knowledge, he fell in with what was being marketed as 'transcendental meditation' in his AFI years, while filming Eraserhead. I don't know what they practice behind closed doors - my interest lies with the Chinese model and they seem cultish to me. But, there's no doubt to me that he passed on the Lucas gig, thinking he was going to work on a vision of some power.The film outright fails because the scope of the book is too big (to think that Hobbit is being stretched into a trilogy these days), and because he lacked the right collaborators and probably the predisposition to make an 'action' Dune.Now Jodorowsky's Dune would have been something to see, probably as cumbersome about spirituality but much more organic. But, it's worth noting a few interesting things about this, in context of how Lynch would expand in later years.He zeroes in on the transcendental experience of 'awakening the sleeper'. He does so in an obvious manner. Rambaldi's spiceworms as blossoming desert flowers top his visual meditation. And that all of Herbert's pomp and mythological noise work against him submerging the idea.Keep in mind the Chinese notion - from the Tao Te Ching - that the 'soft beats the hard', stressed twice in the film even though no one actually thinks or fights in the Chinese way. Discard everything that is hard, from the crass Harkonnen to the acting style (mentat Dourif!) to the sophomoric rousing of Fremen rebellion, laser battles and final redemption.The one part that is soft is at House Atreides, the preparation for Dune. What is there? Familiar dynamics - it's soap opera if you discard the costumes. Premonitions of murder and telepathic wiring with a fabric behind reason. A woman with her box of illusory sensations. A space flight through the doors of perception.It's heady. None of it really works, because Herbert's synchretic universe is not one of internal martial arts, what we see matters. But does any of it remind you of a David Lynch film you know?"
The Manchurian Candidate,2004,6.6,"In the midst of the Gulf War, soldiers are kidnapped and brainwashed for sinister purposes.","The original version of this film was a very disturbing film due to the fact that it was at the height of the cold war and that it was during the time when America and the world faced its greatest crisis in the Cuban Missile Crisis and due to the fact that one short year after the original was released, President Kennedy was assassinated.The main difference between this film and the original was that the original villains were the Communists and the villains in this film is big business. The Manchurian Corporation pretty much could be seen as stand-ins for not only Halleburton, but also could be seen as a stand in for many other corporate entities that pretty much want to wield influence in our government.Another way this film works is as a strong psychological thriller. You pretty much have the troops brainwashed much as they were in the original, only it is more technologically based. However, the thing that really made this film as creepy as it was, was the relationship between Raymond and his mother. In the original, Raymond's mother was nothing more than a manipulative harpy who would stop at nothing to make sure she and her husband became the next president. However, in this version the film goes even farther by even implying that Mrs. Shaw (Mrs. Iselin in the original) almost has an incestuous obsession with her son. This is what really distinguishes this film from the original.This definitely is one of top thrillers of the year."
Taking Lives,2004,6.2,"A murder spree in Montreal, with the killer embracing his victims' identities, leads to an investigation by the FBI agent Illeana Scott. Her bond with an art dealer is crucial to solving the case.","Taking Lives is entertaining but predictable from director D.J. Caruso whose admirable in making this thriller but there are flaws that weigh it down. Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke are good as the two leads. Oliver Martinez, Tcheky Karyo, Jean-Hugh Anglade, and Gena Rowlands are effective as the supporting characters but they lack screen time and development because most of the focus is on Jolie. Kiefer Sutherland is solid in a brief extended appearance before being written out of the movie rather quickly. The rest of the cast are okay in their roles but no one stands out. The movie does have a little suspense but it doesn't pay off because the eventual twist I sort of saw coming. There's a little action including a chase that's well executed but the movie could've used more of it. If there was more suspense, action, character development, and a different twist besides the one they went with the film would've have been that bad. Taking Lives starts off decent but after a while it becomes kind of obvious who the killer is and after the reveal there's no more suspense. The pacing was a little slow at times which didn't help either. Lucikly Caruos kept the running time down to 103 minutes so it's not a total waste of time. Overall despite it's flaws Taking Lives is an okay thriller with a little suspense, action, and solid performances by the cast who make this movie worth watching at least once but after it's over you can't help but feel a little disappointed."
Click,2006,6.4,A workaholic architect finds a universal remote that allows him to fast-forward and rewind to different parts of his life. Complications arise when the remote starts to overrule his choices.,Only a 10 can be given to this monumental art piece that changed cinema forever.
Good Luck Chuck,2007,5.6,"In order to keep the woman of his dreams from falling for another guy, Charlie Logan has to break the curse that has made him wildly popular with single women: Sleep with Charlie once, and the next man you meet will be your true love.",This comedy is really funny. I enjoyed watching it.
Powder Blue,2009,6.2,"Four Los Angelenos, a mortician, an ex-con, a suicidal ex-priest, and a stripper, are brought together on Christmas Eve by a mixture of circumstances.","I rented this movie although many people crucified this movie as being a Crash sequel or just a blurred copy of The Air I Breathe.. Being a great fan of the existential dramas, where destinies cross each other only to emphasize the true value of life and most important the heart mending result of doing something right, (even it is too late) i decided to watch this movie in hope of seeing something equally thrilling to Crash. In fact, Powder Blue has some similarities to Crash or The Air I Breathe, but director Tim Bui manages to underline the most important idea of human destiny: the miracle. Here we see the miracle of destiny that incorporates the miracle of love (Rose and Qwerty), the miracle of divine intervention and hope (Charlie and the trans gender prostitute) and the miracle of sacrifice. (Jack for his daughter Rose)In conclusion this movie is not to be compared to Crash, even it is based on the same destinies-cross-each other-structure. And of course the soundtrack which is surprisingly good, with featured artists like Bliss or Imogen Heap.I recommend this movie 8,5/10"
She's Out of My League,2010,6.4,"An average Joe meets the perfect woman, but his lack of confidence and the influence of his friends and family begin to pick away at the relationship.","Expectations weren't exactly through the roof for SOOML. No big name actors, a director with no feature film experience and a screenplay by the same guys who brought us Sex Drive. It is with great delight then, that what we get is 100 minutes of laughter and light-hearted entertainment. Is it clich√©d? Sure is. We've seen the 'underdog gets the girl' story repetitively since the dawn of cinema, but at least scripters John Morris and Sean Anders inject it with humorous variations to ensure we forgive their shortcomings in originality.Jay Baruchel was another unknown quantity. His supporting turns in Knocked Up, Fanboys, Tropic Thunder and Million Dollar Baby (remember the weakling who frequented the boxing hall despite his complete lack of talent ‚Äì that was Baruchel) have provided laughs galore, but being the main star is different altogether. His geeky exterior and small frame isn't exactly leading man material however Baruchel's great comic timing and willingness to make a fool of himself if required makes him a likable headliner.On the opposite end of the gender pole is the drop-dead gorgeous Alice Eve who, like Molly, is a hard ten. It's not just her looks that makes her popular with the men though, she's genuinely cool and doesn't have a whiff of ego. Elsewhere in the cast you'll find the previously unknown T.J. Miller as Kirk's best mate Stainer ‚Äì a character who resembles Napoleon Dynamite if he were on crack cocaine ‚Äì who delivers a handful of memorable one-liners and plenty of laugh-out-loud moments.A charismatic cast and some hilarious jokes makes this a surprising winner.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"
The Book of Eli,2010,6.8,"A drifter fights his way across a ravaged, post-apocalyptic America while protecting a sacred book that holds the secrets to humanity's salvation.","The first thing that strikes you about this film is how horrid and beautiful it looks all at the same time. We are in a post-apocalyptic world of washed out colours, destroyed structures and dying people scrabbling to make sure they are not the next to die; and it is a world that is really well designed and really well filmed by Don Burgess. Everything looks convincing and it doesn't feel like they just shot it out in a desert location, it genuinely feels like a scorched earth. The only slight irritant about the look of the film is that it does feel very much like a great copy of the world of Fallout 3 as created by Bethseda ‚Äì right down to the design of the ""bandits"" with their goggles and ragged clothing; this bugged me and those very familiar with this world via gaming may also feel the film is ""borrowing"" rather than creating.I talk about the look and style of the film first because to me it is really one of the main reasons to watch this film and indeed for the first 20 minutes or so, it is all we are drifting on ‚Äì this sense of the cool and the barren without much in the way of who's or why's. Unfortunately when the plot does start to come in, it does so with a terribly corny story and message that wouldn't be out of place in one of those overly-earnest low-budget films made by Christian companies. Indeed this is what this film is ‚Äì an overly earnest religious film, it just happens to have cost millions and have massive Hollywood stars involved in it. Now, this is the point where you assume that I dislike the film because it is to do with God and the bible, but this wasn't it all at ‚Äì it didn't help for sure, but this isn't the reason.The main problem I have is that the film doesn't actually seem interested in making this message work and the plot just seems like a necessary evil to get the character walking in slow-mo around this cool landscape. There isn't much development beyond the basic dialogue about the power of this book and it is nothing but endless corn in the main; I may have respected it more if it had done something with the content, but it doesn't, indeed it seems almost embarrassed by it. The Hughes Brothers for sure aren't particularly interested in that and thus the performances and shots are all about the style, the atmosphere and the look of the film. Accordingly the cast do the same ‚Äì which is fine because I wonder why they were all queuing up to be in this story. Washington is a great lead because he is all style and presence and he fits the landscape well. Kunis' character makes less sense as she goes on but she is stunning to look at and again fits the style aspect of the film. Oldman's villain is poor and as a result he is only OK.What all this leaves then is a film that should be watched by fans of Fallout 3 and New Vegas, simply because it is a great film recreation of those worlds, from the colour of the sky down to the costumes it feels and looks like the games. Outside of this though, the casual viewer is left with very little of interest going on behind the style; the story is cloyingly religious and lacking any insight or intelligence ‚Äì in terms of writing it feels like having two guys at your door trying to sell Jesus to you with platitudes and clich√©s. It all looks fantastic but unfortunately the script simply doesn't deserve the visuals."
The Bucket List,2007,7.3,Two terminally ill men escape from a cancer ward and head off on a road trip with a wish list of to-dos before they die.,"Usually I'm not into these kinds of movies, but with the casting of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman I had to see it. I'm really glad that I decided to give this a try.The story is quite predictable, but I still enjoyed it. Never mind how impossible the storyline is because it is a great movie about friendship - how two men become great friends in a short time and help each other out throughout the time they are together. It moves along at a smooth pace and I never got bored, so the writer gets credit for that. The acting was top notch as Nicholson and Freeman draw forth the right emotion in the audience at the right time. The emotional parts are done just right, but the funny scenes are the best. I laughed throughout the movie but not as much as I would in a true comedy movie, but the comic scenes in this one really work and Nicholson is the ""main man"" in them. It does have a message at the end about how you should live your life to the fullest, how your family is important, and how you should be happy in life and the movie delivers that message perfectly.Other than the predictable storyline and the sometimes cheesy dialog, the movie is great. I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a feel-good movie.8/10"
Dolphin Tale,2011,6.8,"A boy finds a dolphin that was injured in a trap. They become friends, but the dolphin needs to have its tail amputated to survive. With the help of a biologist and a prosthetics specialist, the boy tries to save the animal.","""Family is forever.""Although Dolphin Tale is by far not my favorite film of the year, like Midnight in Paris, it is a solid kids' film, an adventure that treats animals and 11 year olds with respect and doesn't demonize adults.A dolphin, Winter, needs a new tail to survive a crab-trap entanglement, and 11 year old Sawyer Nelson is the new friend to help her through the adjustment. His job: show us that being excited about something worthwhile is the answer to school blues and mother loss. The film is aces at showing that being engaged in helping a living being leads to success and happiness.A slew of other good-willed people help Winter, from like-minded friends to doctors to grandpas. And that's the sweet point of the film, emblazoned on an all-purpose Swiss Army knife: ""Family is Forever."" With two crucial families needing a mother in one and a father in the other, ""family"" extends to the community that nurtures children, adults, and animals. Not only does a Clearwater, Florida, marine rescue hospital need financial support to continue, so also does a crippled soldier and Winter. The figurative connections are obvious but still carefully entered into the drama so as not to heighten the sugar content.Besides, any movie that includes Kris Kristofferson as a benevolent grandpa and Morgan Freeman as a caring prosthetics doctor can't be all bad. For a supposedly sophisticated film critic, I'm veritably childlike in the presence of these accomplished actors. BTW, Ashley Judd as single mom gets my attention, as she always does.Yet that Winter, she's all any man could want: smart and silky with mysterious eyes that seem to say, ""With our help, you men will make it just fine."" No man bashing in this film, just recognition that communal charity and mutual respect will win the day.Something about this Disneyesque, retro children's adventure makes me happy."
Philadelphia,1993,7.7,"When a man with HIV is fired by his law firm because of his condition, he hires a homophobic small-time lawyer as the only willing advocate for a wrongful dismissal suit.","Philadelphia is a guttingly emotional and tragic story of how a lawyer fired for having AIDS attempts to vindicate himself in court.  Tom Hanks gives perhaps the most powerful performance of his career as Andrew Beckett, the afflicted lawyer.  He received the Academy Award in a waltz, and you could almost pick any of his major scenes as worthy of the award.This movie is probably the best drama regarding gay issues ever made. Remember, it was made in 1993, when AIDS was still a terminal disease, and it recalls the early days of an epidemic that may not square with the vision afforded today, but at the time, this was the reality of AIDS.The entire crew is A-List.  Tak Fujimoto, who would also film Silence of the Lambs and Sixth Sense, directed cinematography.  Jonathan Demme, also of Silence of the Lambs fame, directs with typical honesty and grit.  Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young contributed hauntingly touching original songs. Even Antonio Banderas, whom I never miss an opportunity to vilify, is moving as Hanks' devoted and supportive partner.  Denzel Washington was well cast as the homophobic lawyer who ultimately takes Hanks' case, and Mary Steenburgen is surprising in an uncharacteristic villain role.Ron Vawter, who played one of the lawyers in the firm from which Hanks was fired, and also appeared in Silence of the Lambs, was himself suffering from AIDS at the time of filming, and he eventually succumbed to it a few years later.  His appearance in the film encapsulates the reality of the AIDS epidemic, in that it often touched our lives in unexpected places.Although I have literally thousands of movies in my collection, I don't own this one.  Not because I don't love it.  I do.  It's because I can't watch it without being overcome by emotion.  Anyone who can watch Hanks' in the Opera scene, or hear Springsteen's or Young's eerie and melancholy ballads and not weep is dead inside.  But in the end, Philadelphia is about life, and making it matter."
Awakenings,1990,7.8,Dr. Sayer is a pioneering neurologist who wants to take a risk and give his patients who suffer from encephalitis a drug used for Parkinson's Disease. He tries it out on one man who miraculously wakes from his perpetual catatonic state.,"The victims of an encephalitis epidemic many years ago have been catatonic ever since, but now a new drug offers the prospect of reviving them.Dustin Hoffman as an autistic man in ""Rain Man""? You have nothing on Robert DeNiro as a post-encephalitic Parkinson's patient in this film! The tics, the walk, the antics... obviously I was not there when this actually happened, but I was impressed. Robin Williams did alright, too, playing it straight in one of his many turns as a doctor on film.I love Oliver Sacks and his writing, and I am glad they were able to make such a great adaptation that was both educational and entertaining (like his books are). Was the transformation so sudden and dramatic in real life? I have my doubts. But you have to cut corners to fit within two hours, so if this was one way, it is forgivable.Ebert gives this four of four stars. I think he was spot on with this one, and his longer-than-average review (stuffed with praise) is excellent."
Patch Adams,1998,6.9,"The true story of the heroic Hunter ""Patch"" Adams who's determined to become a medical doctor because of his desire to help other people. He ventures where no doctor ever ventured before utilizing humor and pathos.","Patch Adams is classic Robin Williams. The film is funny at times, moving at times, and a good movie to watch.I really don't get the people who have such negative reviews, did they even watch the same movie?"
The Birdcage,1996,7.2,"A gay cabaret owner and his drag queen companion agree to put up a false straight front so that their son can introduce them to his fianc√©e's right-wing, conservative parents.","If it weren't for the fact this movie has as its world a gay nightclub and gay men, it could have starred Cary Grant and been one of those wacky comedies of the forties. This is absolutely a hoot. To start with, you have Robin Williams and Nathan Lane, two of the most amazing, on their feet comedians ever. Throw in the plot of ""if we could pull this off for one night,"" and everything else is up for grabs. The dialogue is excellent with all its double entendres and dramatic irony. We have the Senator, thoroughly enjoying himself, without realizing he is flirting with a man, and everything else relating to that. Of course, there is constant backtracking and improvisation. You have to laugh."
Jack,1996,5.8,"Because of an unusual disorder that has aged him four times faster than a typical human being, a boy looks like a 40-year-old man as he starts fifth grade at public school after being homeschooled.","This movie has something very important attached to it: a message of life. This is due to the underlying themes as well as to Robin Williams' touching performance which is saddening and inspirational at the same time. He is able to transform the sheer hopelessness of his fate which subjects him to an early death with such outstanding and sincere skills that are deeply moving. Apart from that his entire character - as it is designed - demands substantial acting throughout the whole plot. He delivers a performance that many other actors would simply not have been able to accomplish. It takes a special kind of actor to portray such a character just as Jack here. The message is that despite a fate that destines us to be exposed to tremendous agonies and blank despair, there is always a light of hope, and this light burns in our hearts. It's up to us only what we do with the time that we're granted with. In Jack's case time is even more precious than for normal people. Despite the sadness and despair that is ultimately caused thereby, we still have the chance to make the best out of every minute. All we have to do is value the little things, such as friendship and love, and thus escape the shades of darkness. The movie itself is funny and sincere, it has important dialogues and, as stated above, a real massage, which makes it special. Watch out for it."
Bicentennial Man,1999,6.9,"The life and times of Andrew, a robot purchased as a household appliance programmed to perform menial tasks.

Although it starts out unsatisfying, the film gradually becomes more and more penetrating as we discover the film is really about inner emotions,  the changing of times, how people change over time, and the meaning of life from an original point of view. ""Bicentennial Man"" is a sweet, touching production with lots of heart and a shapely message.At first ""Bicentennial Man"" looks  to be about a futuristic family who buys an android robot that is supposed to do housework and serve them. The family of four includes two children, one named Little Miss, and the parents who are called by the name of Sir and Ma'am. They adopt Andrew expecting him to be similar to all the other androids in the area. Nearly every household has one. However, Sir soon notices certain features about Andrew that make him unique, different from any other android he has ever seen. Andrew occupies creativity and emotional personality, elements that these robots are presumed not to contain.The film doesn't contain a good an introduction to the family who adopts Andrew, which is mainly the reason why I was never entirely concerned for the characters. But the reasoning behind the lack of focus on the family is due to the fact that ""Bicentennial Man"" isn't about the family who buys Andrew, but a narrative of Andrew himself.A running flaw in the film is our foundering curiosity that only grows more ponderous as the script progresses. The audience desires more information about why Andrew is so different from the other robots. There are obvious reasons, sure, but what I wanted was an explanation of why he is special. A lust for information that is never appropriately granted.The film skips ahead a generation or so. Sir and Ma'am age and Little Miss grows to be a full grown woman. Many things change for Andrew. He begins to wonder what lies beyond the likes of his household. He longs for emotional reactions to take place on his face and the concept of freedom. Sir has taught Andrew about death, sex, love, humor, and time. He gradually wants more and more independence. This is where Andrew starts becoming interested in turning from a mechanical being to a biological being.The age advancing make-up is believable and awe-inducing. I could hardly trust my eyes that Sam Neill wasn't an old man in the movie. However, although I can see that the filmmakers had no other reliable option, I disliked the jumps in time the it takes. The time gaps force us out of massive plot pieces, some of which are important to the character development.There are some really funny moments in ""Bicentennial Man."" Most of them appear when the picture becomes a bit emotionally heavy, in order to relieve such tension in the audience. This is a wise choice in the writer's part; the viewers who do mistake this movie as a family comedy will gain some satisfaction from these insulated humorous moments.I wanted more information on how the robot Andrew gradually becomes ''human.'' I felt cheated out of a lot of decent, noteworthy material here. I felt this way because the scenes where we do have the privilege to see Andrew reinvented are wonderfully inventive and interesting. The film should have leaned towards that material a little more.The movie features super charged performances by the entire cast. Robin Williams offers an emotionally accurate acting job that brings the confusion and imagination of the android Andrew to life. The supporting cast is also filled with fine performances with Sam Neill, Wendy Crewson, Embeth Davidtz, and Oliver Platt.Even though I can admit that ""Bicentennial Man"" contains several flawed motives, I still was a little surprised that the film opened to many negative reviews. This isn't a bad movie, just a differently anticipated one. The movie sets up its effective conclusion from the very beginning; it is the only logical climax for such a story. Although it leaves viewers with a sense of well-being, I thought it posed too many spiritual and biological questions. Overall, however, the movie is a well-depicted idea that deserves more appreciation from audiences than its receiving.Brought to you by Touchstone Pictures and Columbia Pictures."
Paranoia,2013,5.6,"An entry-level employee at a powerful corporation finds himself occupying a corner office, but at a dangerous price: he must spy on his boss's old mentor to secure for him a multi-billion dollar advantage.","""Privacy. Absolute myth. There's no such thing.""The film starts off on the wrong foot and never manages to get on track. In the very opening scene you have Liam Hemsworth using voice over narration explaining to us what we are about to see, and you realize that you are going to watch a clich√©d unoriginal action thriller. Then there is a scene where Gary Oldman's character is looking at some art pieces with Liam and he mentions how Picasso once said that there are no original ideas, that everything is either copied or stolen. You kind of get a sense of a similar thing going on with this script. Paranoia is an action thriller that seems recycled with no fresh ideas and unfortunately lacks thrills. The script was adapted by Jason Dean Hall (Spread) and Barry Levy (Vantage Point) from Joseph Finder's novel, but nothing about it feels inspiring or original. It is a shame because I was excited to get to see Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman face off once again, but Paranoia easily belongs on my worst films of 2013 list mainly because these talented actors can't do anything to improve a weak script. Paranoia gets half a star for Amber Heard who looks stunning despite not adding anything to the story, and another star for Oldman and Ford's presence alone. I could forgive the uninspiring script if at least this technological thriller actually had some thrills, but it doesn't. There aren't any interesting thrills either and the narrative is pretty straight forward and predictable.Adam Cassidy (Liam Hemsworth) has been working for an important technological company known as Wyatt Corporation for the past six years. He hasn't been able to ascend the corporate ladder the way he pictured it as he continues to be an entry level employee, but he and his team are expecting a break through when given the opportunity to present their next project to the boss, Nicolas Wyatt (Gary Oldman). The presentation doesn't go as planned and Adam is left unemployed along with the rest of his team. Feeling bad about the way things turned out, Adam invites them to a fancy club where they use the company's credit card. The next day Adam is called back to Wyatt's office as he is confronted for his crime. Taking advantage of Adam's hunger for wealth and power, Wyatt recruits him to spy on his nemesis: Jock Goddard (Harrison Ford). Goddard happens to run another billion dollar tech company which is his biggest competition. Wyatt wants Adam to win Jock's trust and discover what they are working on, and in return he promises him the life he has always dreamed of. Blinded by greed Adam accepts and soon will find himself way in over his head.Richard Dreyfuss has a small role in this film as well and his presence only reminds us that a film focusing on him or the other secondary characters such as Oldman and Ford, would be so much better. Instead they allow Hemsworth to play the lead role and he simply doesn't have that on screen charisma to carry a film on his own. I don't think he's a bad actor, but he needs stronger material to keep the audience's interest. He is just outclassed in this film by the other talented actors and we are left out wanting to see more of them. Another issue I had with Paranoia is that the plot doesn't make much sense and it is so dull that it allows you to begin to think too much about it and find all sort of holes. Robert Luketic has just directed his third straight flop after the disappointing Killers and The Ugly Truth. I will defend him for 21, which was a film that at least kept me entertained, but his latest efforts have been really disappointing. Paranoia might just top them all; stay away from this film."
Highlander II: The Quickening,1991,4.2,"In the future, Highlander Connor MacLeod must prevent the destruction of Earth under an anti-ozone shield.",This film is not often given it due. The insurence company took over the production and the director lost control of it. Many viewers of the quickining version hold a grudge and have refused to see it. I have seen both versions. However I saw the Renegade first and thought that it explained the Immortality issue better than the first. It was  a beautiful film visually and a good plot.
Street Fighter,1994,4.1,"In the midst of a civil war in South East Asia, a general intensifies the climate of violence by kidnapping 63 UN delegates. To free the hostages, a colonel leads a group of fighters, who will have to use all their skills to be successful.","""There can be only one"".....film that is, which is worse than all others and THIS is it folks!A movie for adolescent pea-brains. Not a solitary video-game has transferred to the big screen with even a modicum of success. Is money THAT available to make movies, that such an embarrassment as this could reach the point of actual RELEASE? Maybe no video distributor would touch it and they had no choice?By far Van Dumb's worst flick. Playing Colonel William Guile, he leads his commandos against the seriously insane General Bison, dictator and megalomaniac of the fictitious Shadaloo. Filmed on the cheap, up on Australia's Gold Coast amidst the worst plasticised sets you ever saw. Phony explosions fill the sky, make-up is at the level of Grade 2 face-painting and a script to match. The acting beggars belief, Kylie Minogue's just about topping the list! This is seriously heavy-duty garbage! Much was made of the ""singing budgie's""  martial arts training for the film. From memory, she gets to perform a total of three high kicks which would be unlikely to cause distress to an elderly pensioner.As for Raul Julia as General Bison? It was to be his last screen role, completed just before his death (maybe he saw the rushes?) It is a sad epitaph he would never have wished for. No-one comes out of this mess looking good, not even the paying audience - ESPECIALLY them! In hindsight, the very last scene sums up the cringe-factor..watch it!"
Mortal Kombat,1995,5.8,Three martial artists are forced to battle demonic adversaries in another dimension with the fate of the world hanging in the balance.,"""Mortal Kombat"" in my opinion is just an awesome movie. I think because I was such a fan of the video games, the days when Sega was the ""thang"". LOL, way before Playstation there was Sega! But, I really just loved the characters and this story just always appealed to me. I think because also my friends and I enjoyed acting the movie and video game out. No, we didn't kill each other, we just loved the characters.Yes, despite this being a typical video game movie, I still think it was cool to watch, still to this day I don't mind watching. It has an awesome soundtrack, excellent moves, and a great look and feel to the movie itself. Just let go and have fun with it, if you enjoyed the video games, I think you should enjoy ""Mortal Kombat"". It's just cool to watch and keeps you on the edge of your seat in excitement!7/10"
Death Race,2008,6.4,Ex-con Jensen Ames is forced by the warden of a notorious prison to compete in our post-industrial world's most popular sport: a car race in which inmates must brutalize and kill one another on the road to victory.,"2012 the economy has hit bottom, broke through and has kept on descending. Along the way prisons have been handed over to the private sector that have chosen to make a profit by broadcasting gladiatorial style death matches starring the inmates, with the reward to the inmates after 5 victories ¬ñ FREEDOM Enter Jensen Ames (Jason Stratham) a recently unemployed steel worker and former race car driver who lost his license but no matter how bad things are, he's a happy man as long as he has his family.That is, until he's set up for the murder of his wife, imprisoned, and forced to compete in Death Race if he ever hopes to see his daughter again.But enough of the plot! A paragraph blurb at the start and 8 minutes of character development is pushing the limits of this flick and that's not why a person would see a W.S. Anderson/Jason Stratham action flick and besides, a plot would allow ""plot holes"" and who needs to deal with that headache? The rest of the movie takes place in the 3 days of Death Race. The first 2 days are competition/elimination rounds reminiscent of Mario Kart as if it was designed by some rogue member of GTA on a disgruntled day but who loved the hidden short cuts and power-ups.Amongst all the adrenaline filled action, Anderson makes sure to toss in the occasional character development or when he's feeling really daring he'll toss in some pseudo-dramatic realization our hero comes across which helps remind the movie-goer that the movie has a plot rather than just a string of explosive action sequence. All of this is done with the utmost use of clich√© and designed to inspire the excitable little 12 year old boy in many of us to stay riveted in our seats as we wait for Jensen to strike with angry revenge for all he's been through.The movie is everything a modern day movie aficionado should not like. It's brainless, sexist, ridiculously violent, and lacks any redeemable qualities. These are also all the reasons why I had so much fun with the movie. I went seeing what I expected and that's exactly what I wanted to see!"
Alien vs. Predator,2004,5.7,"During an archaeological expedition on Bouvet√∏ya Island in Antarctica, a team of archaeologists and other scientists find themselves caught up in a battle between the two legends. Soon, the team realize that only one species can win.","Reviewers say 'Alien vs. Predator' offers an intriguing crossover but falls short in execution. Fans enjoyed the iconic battles, though they were sparse. Special effects and creature designs were praised, despite some CGI issues. The plot received mixed reviews, with inconsistencies noted. Characters were criticized for being underdeveloped. The PG-13 rating disappointed those expecting more gore. Despite flaws, many found it entertaining and saw potential for sequels."
Highlander,1986,7.0,"An immortal Scottish swordsman must confront the last of his immortal opponents, a murderously brutal barbarian who lusts for the fabled ""Prize"".","Highlander is an ingenious and very entertaining science fiction film which has come in for rather a lot of (unwarranted) scathing criticism. Although the plot jumps around with reckless abandon, the scripters Gregory Widen, Larry Ferguson and Peter Bellwood manage to pull in all the loose ends by the climax. The word ""confusing"" has been used to describe the film quite often as well, but if you stick with it the confusing moments are explained quite cleverly towards the closing reels. This is, in fact, not a bad film at all. I'd venture to say it's a pretty good one.The opening sequence has Russell Nash (Christopher Lambert) at a wrestling match in New York's Madison Square Gardens. He leaves early, and while walking through the underground car park is confronted by a man with a sword. Nash is not perturbed by this - he merely brandishes a sword of his own, and the pair of them fight to the death, resulting in the decapitation of Nash's opponent. Slowly, we learn (via flashbacks) that Nash is an immortal swordsman who has spent centuries duelling with like immortals. The only way they can die is by decapitation at the hands of one of their counterparts. Each swordsman has spent the whole of history pursuing the others, hoping to be the last one alive whereupon he will gain mortality, virility and vast knowledge.The film is very energetic (what would you expect from a former music video director?) with dazzling camera work and a pounding, Flash Gordon-style soundtrack by Queen. Sean Connery has a pleasant supporting role as an immortal who teaches Lambert the art of swordplay, and Alan North has a funny part as a bewildered cop who can't figure out why headless corpses keep turning up in his city. The film's intentionally muddled structure is slightly irritating on the first viewing, but with repeated viewings it becomes more comprehensible, even clever. Highlander is a good, inventive piece of hokum.... and it's a real shame that those very same critics who are always grumbling about the lack of cinematic imagination these days didn't give it some merit when it was first released."
Fast & Furious,2009,6.5,"Brian O'Conner, back working for the FBI in Los Angeles, teams up with Dominic Toretto to bring down a heroin importer by infiltrating his operation.","This is one of these 107-minute testosterone movies guys crave every once in awhile, some more than others. Being a somewhat-old guy, I don't look as these as often anymore but every once in awhile it's fun to kick back and just watch fast cars, loose women, wild action and fairly-brainless film.There isn't much of a plot but my guess is people who are fans of this film series don't care. Just give us the above - muscle cars, macho men, sexy babes and a few great chase scenes - and that's all that is asked. I thought the best scene was the first one, a chase down mountain in the Dominican Republic. That was like a James Bond opening scene: a real attention-getter.After that, you get the normal F&F material, which glamorizes things that shouldn't be (racing through crowded streets, etc.) but also has the ""good"" guys going to capture a drug lord from Mexico.....and a lot of punks along the way. They all sneer and have a lot of tattoos.I've only seen this one and the first in the series but from what I read here, I've seen the two best of the four Fast & Furious films. Vin Diesel helps make them a notch above the others, I suspect. He's always interesting as ""Dom Toretto"" and his character is the most credible."
Scary Movie,2000,6.3,"A year after disposing of the body of a man they accidentally killed, a group of dumb teenagers are stalked by a bumbling serial killer.","Like most movie parodies, `Scary Movie' starts out well then begins to head downhill as it exhausts the possibilities of its limited material. Certainly, few genres are as rife for self-satire as the teen slasher films that have proliferated in theatres ever since the early 1980's.  Seeing, however, as even some of the earliest `Friday the 13th' and `Halloween' films seem like ancient history to today's core movie going public, `Scary Movie' draws upon more contemporary examples of the genre like `Scream' and `I Know What You Did Last Summer' as its source of inspiration.  In its opening stretches, `Scary Movie' has a great deal of fun parodying the many ludicrous conventions that have long defined these films:  the use of 30-year old actors to portray empty-headed, nubile adolescents; the heavy emphasis on teen sexuality and partial nudity; the inane actions of the killer's victims who seem to do everything possible to hurl themselves into dangerous situations; and the oh-so-predictable false scare (usually caused by a leaping cat) followed immediately by the inevitable killer's attack.Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans and boasting a screenplay concocted by no fewer than six (count ¬ëem SIX) writers, `Scary Movie' establishes a high speed rhythm and pace that the filmmakers manage to sustain through most of the film's 88-minute running time ¬ñ though there is a noticeable tendency on the part of the film to lag in the last half hour.  Part of the problem could be that, as with most films made up essentially of sound and sight gags haphazardly strung together, it is inevitable that some of the bits will succeed better than others and that, as the movie rolls along, the inspiration will run a little dry and the humor will become less spontaneous and more forced.  Indeed, this type of movie genre parody has always worked best when applied in small doses on TV series like `Saturday Night Live,' `In Living Color' and even the `Carol Burnett Show.'  Stretched out to full length, such concepts often suffer the curse of diminishing returns.Occasionally, the screenplay edges so close to the limits of good taste that one may question whether or not the material is truly appropriate for the age group at which the movie is obviously targeted.  The crudity is actually much more comically effective when it is merely hinted at than when it is so openly spelled out and displayed.  But then subtlety is not exactly a strong suit of the straight horror movie genre either.`Scary Movie' is, at least, blessed with a winning, game cast made up of appropriately post adolescent actors who understand well the mannerisms and speech patterns of the stereotypes they embody.  The overall good-natured quality of the film and its fairly high laugh ratio of gems to clunkers make `Scary Movie' an imperfect but generally likeable popcorn entertainment."
Fast & Furious 6,2013,7.0,"Hobbs has Dominic and Brian reassemble their crew to take down a team of mercenaries, but Dominic unexpectedly gets sidetracked with facing his presumed deceased girlfriend, Letty.",Part 6 does not disappoint. More action then ever. If you added Bruce Willis this could have been Die Hard 6
Transporter 3,2008,6.1,"Frank Martin is forced to deliver Valentina, the kidnapped daughter of a Ukrainian government official, from Marseilles to Odessa on the Black Sea. En route, he has to contend with thugs who want to intercept Valentina's safe delivery.","I loved both Transporter and Transporter 2, and I couldn't wait until opening day of Transporter 3. I recruited a few of my friends and we made a girls' night outing to see it. My big disappointment was with the director's comic fast-frames in the fight sequences. Jason Statham moves so fluidly in fight sequences, that it's both beautiful and a turn-on to watch. However, with jerky camera movements and the ridiculous fast-forwarding, the elements of grace and power were lost. The director tried to substitute plenty of still moments with a shirtless Statham in an attempt to give us some eye candy, but none of this did Jason justice, nor was it a fitting substitute. Natalya Rudakova was much too young for him as a romantic interest (kind of creepy), and I was unconvinced by her cheesy accent and her character's incongruent language mastery. Her character went from describing gourmet delicacies in perfect English to saying ""what means ____"" (insert basic word).I loved Fran√ßois Berl√©and again, and of course Jason put in another outstanding performance. Natalya could have been a fun character, without the bad accent and romantic twist to the plot.Please give us a Transporter 4 more in line with the previous two films!!"
Lethal Weapon 3,1992,6.7,Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh pursue a former LAPD officer who uses his knowledge of police procedure and policies to steal and sell confiscated guns and ammunition to local street gangs.,"The first 'Lethal Weapon' wasn't perfect, but it is still a very good film and important to the development of the buddy-cop film as well as being one of the best examples. Its first sequel is almost as good, if just missing out on being on the same level or surpassing it.'Lethal Weapon 3' is fun enough, and there is plenty to enjoy, but after the impressive first two films it was somewhat of a let-down. It didn't feel as fresh and had a ran out of ideas feel sometimes. Its weak link is the story, which does have some exciting moments and some good scenes but the first two films were much more focused and tight in plotting, here the story does meander in places and parts drag. Some of the dialogue is a lot of fun, some of it is repetitive and convoluted with a little too much emphasis at times on humour.After being such a delight in the second film, Joe Pesci returns and one was hoping he would be a welcome presence. Sadly count me in as one of the people who found him underused, his character merely being a plot device and Pesci being irritating this time round (the first time ever he's had that effect on me). Was mixed on the villain, Stuart Wilson does enjoy himself immensely and does bring a sinister edge to easily the best acted head villain in comparison to the first two films where the henchmen were more memorable and better played. The character himself was a little sketchy in development however and he could have been used more.However, the way 'Lethal Weapon 3' is shot and designed screams slick and stylish while Richard Donner once again directs with an assured hand. The score is atmospheric and groovy.Parts of the script doe entertain hugely and crackle in wit and tension.Once again, the action is slick and bursts with excitement and tension, with terrific stunts and the sheer scale of them being worthy of huge admiration. It is very easy to see why the chalk and cheese chemistry of the polar opposite characters of Riggs and Murtaugh became so popular, very rarely in a buddy-cop film has this kind of chemistry been so entertaining and perfectly pitched.Mel Gibson continues to excel in a performance as witty and intense has before. Danny Glover gives Murtaugh the right amount of spirit, subtlety and no-nonsense attitude. Rene Russo brings some much needed freshness and gives a strong performance.In summary, fun but the magic is not quite there for me. Not one of the best sequels there is, but hardly a disgrace and nowhere near among the worst. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
Just Go with It,2011,6.4,"On a weekend trip to Hawaii, a plastic surgeon convinces his loyal assistant to pose as his soon-to-be-divorced wife in order to cover up a careless lie he told to his much-younger girlfriend.","I've seen almost all of Jennifer Aniston's movies and most of them I really did not like. So my expectations of ""Just go with it"" were very low. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was laughing with tears in my eyes the first 20min of watching this movie and I didn't stop laughing till the screen showed black.Al though the movie almost is 2 hours long, I wasn't bored at any time. The story was well written, the acting was amazing and hilarious and it was original in it's jokes. It did have a typical ending, but for once it didn't bother me because of the good build up in the story and the development of the characters.If you do have a weakness for typical comedy movies, but can't seem to find a good one these days, definitely check out this one: laughter guaranteed!"
"I, Robot",2004,7.1,"In 2035, a technophobic cop investigates a crime that may have been perpetrated by a robot, which leads to a larger threat to humanity.","When I was growing up, one of my favourite authors was Isaac Asimov. I loved his books and his ideas about robots. The man was a genius in the way he wrote, he invented the three laws of Robotics, as the very beginning of the movie tells us, they are: 1) A robot can never harm a human. 2) A robot must obey all human orders unless it conflicts with the first law. 3) A robot must protect itself unless it conflicts with the first two laws.Because of this and because of the fact that I knew Will Smith was the leading actor in this movie I went into this movie with lowered expectations. I expected to see a corny movie full of explosions and killer robots.I did get that, or at least the explosions part, but imagine my surprise when the movie ended up exceeding my expectations and more. Even though during the ending credits it says that the movie was suggested by the books by Isaac Asimov most of the movie seemed to play quite well with Isaac Asimov's ideas about robots. The movie played with concepts that Isaac Asimov played with, if the three laws can be made, they can be broken. And it was an Asimov-ish ""whodunit"" as well.Will Smith managed to pull off a stunning performance as ""Del Spooner"", a Chicago detective that is suspicious of robots and is against technology. His acting is much more like his acting in ""Enemy of the State"" than his performances in his other two Science Fiction flicks, ""Independence Day"" and ""Men in Black"". He is a believable character, one that you end up sympathising with as you learn why, exactly, he hates robots so much.A highly critiqued point usually comes from the fans of the book in that Bridget Moynahan plays Susan Calvin. It is true that Moynahan as Calvin is much younger than the Isaac Asimov version, but beyond that I found her to be a pleasant surprise as well. She plays her persona very well, delivering a wooden, robot-like performance. She is obvious in the fact that she likes robots much more than humans, and her dislike of Spooner is amusing. Over the course of the movie she thaws a little, but not an incredible lot. I find her to be a believable character.The pure stroke of genius in this movie is the robot, Sonny, who at first reminds one of Data from Star Trek. His character evolves over the course of the story, and Alex Proyas does a good job at keeping us guessing at whether the emotional robot is a ""good guy"" or not.This movie, which I've now seen twice, has been raked over the coals so to speak in the realm of artistic licence, but I felt that Isaac Asimov, if he were here, would have been rather pleased with this movie. The only two points of conflict, perhaps, would be the amount of violence against actual robots in the story (he was never that violent in his short stories/books) and the very typical Hollywood blow'emup climax, which, yes, smacked heavily of Terminator for a while there. The ending, I felt, repaired and wrapped up nicely, making up for whatever excessive action went on before it.Two notes about the cinematography in this movie, first of all, the Matrix scene was not necessary. A character was being chased and did a Trinity pause in mid-air pose, which pulled me out of the movie for a couple seconds. Luckily it wasn't too hard to get back into the movie. Second note was something that I felt was very innovative on the part of Alex Proyas, which was the ""camera moving with moving object"" shots. I noticed at least three of them in the movie. Very nice film work there. I'm sure it will get horribly overdone in the next few years, but for now it is nice. The CGI also gets honourable mention for making the robots meld so well with their surroundings. Finally CGI has reached a point where they don't seem fake, even for a moment.In regards to nudity in the movie... I've read a couple of reviews which notice the Moynahan nude in fogged up shower scene, and forget to notice the Will Smith completely nude with no fog shower scene. I must say, as a female viewer it is nice to get the generous end of the stick when it comes to seeing something as, dare I say appealing? as Will Smith's very nicely developed body.Lastly and in a point that has nothing to do with the movie and more to do with questions brought up by it-- It took until a day later and thinking about the movie some more that I realized that ""I, Robot"" was also very socially different. As in two of the main characters, including the hero are black males, one woman, and one (male) robot. I didn't find this odd at all in watching it, perhaps because Will Smith is such a recognisable character, but after thinking about it, I felt that this is a very positive sign. It shows, to me, that society is changing. I feel that I wouldn't have been able to see that, even 10-15 years ago and thought nothing of it. I've noticed this before though... that the most gender/social equal views seem to come from science fiction in our media... it is interesting.Now, of course the movie does bring up some ethical questions like if it's all right to make a servant/slave class out of robots, etc., but all in all I really liked this movie. Any movie that makes you think is a good movie, any movie that gives you fun, drama, action, mystery, and makes you think is a great movie. Thank goodness I, Robot is all of the above."
The Switch,2010,6.1,"Seven years after the fact, a man comes to the realization that he was the sperm donor for his best friend's boy.","The Switch's first thirty minutes remind me of screwball comedies with repartee sharp, fast, and witty: unmarried Kassie (Jennifer Aniston) announces to her best friend, Wally (Jason Bateman), that she is going to arrange for a donor to have a baby. I know‚Äîwe've been there this year with Back-up Plan and The Kids are All Right, yet there's plenty of room for all kinds of donations.Bateman is at his under-acting, low key, gentle best responding to Aniston's usually cute bemusement because, as you might have guessed, he loves her but has not the daring to tell her. Then, at the donor party, he gets excited in the bathroom at a picture of Diane Sawyer and switches his sperm for the donor's.You've seen similar romantic comedy setups where the principals know each other too well or dislike each other so much that they will be enlightened and bond by the end of the film. You know how it all will turn out, so after that smart opening, the film devolves into clich√©d expectation fulfillment.However, scenes between Wally and six-year old Sebastian (Thomas Robinson), his son by the switch but a secret to mother and son for much of the film, are well-acted given the appropriate level of dialogue, their mutual respect, and the film's unwillingness to exploit Robinson's cuteness to elicit favorable reviews. But after all, like his dad, Sebastian's a pessimist with eccentric and sometimes macabre tastes, not always exploitable characteristics. In any case, these two actors are as good as one could expect to show a loving relationship between two eccentrics who don't know for some time they are related.Saving the film from my impending ""C"" grade are Jeff Goldblum as Leonard, Wally's best male friend; the cute Thomas Robinson as Sebastian, Kassie's son; and manic Juliette Lewis as Debbie, Kassie's best girl friend. With weak competition like Bow Wow in Lottery Ticket, Aniston manages to be in a film just a bit above my average. Too bad because that opening is worth seeing just for itself."
The Amazing Spider-Man 3D,2012,6.9,"After Peter Parker is bitten by a genetically altered spider, he gains newfound, spider-like powers and ventures out to save the city from the machinations of a mysterious reptilian foe.","Spider-Man is my favorite super-hero of all time. I've read the comics (mostly the Ultimate comics, but some of the 60's comics as well), played some of the video games, and watched the cartoons (The 1994 and 2008 series being some of my favorite animated shows of all time).I enjoyed Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy (yes, even Spider-Man 3). When I heard that the series was being rebooted, I wasn't happy to hear about it. My expectations were neutral as time went by and when I walked out the theater, my expectations were blown away.I don't want to compare this movie to the original trilogy, but I think it's necessary to see where this movie improved from the originals.Let's start with the casting. Andrew Garfield is a great successor to Tobey Maguire. I can really relate to him like I always do with other incarnations of the web slinger. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is even better than Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. Gwen is a much stronger character and the chemistry between her and Garfield as Peter Parker is believable. Rhys Ifans is great as Doctor Connors (a.k.a. The Lizard) and I like how he is a ""Jekyll and Hyde""-type of villain (kind of like a few other villains... yeah). Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May, respectively, are also great as well. All the characters are portrayed very well and are believable.The visual effects and the action scenes are good as usual, but nothing new.The musical score by James Horner is also great, although I prefer Danny Elfman's score in the original trilogy because they felt more memorable and left a lasting impression. But, who knows? James Horner's score may grow on me over time.If I have to name some complaints, it would have to be that some parts were rushed (although it's a minor nitpick) as well as a couple of parts not evaluated much. I think an extended cut of the movie would be necessary when it's released on DVD, but that's just me.Overall, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a fresh new start on the franchise. It has superb acting, thrilling action scenes (especially the climax), an amazing score, and being faithful to the comics but at the same time taking liberties to make it more interesting. Best Spidey movie ever? It's too early to tell but maybe. It's definitely worth watching and I am looking forward to the sequel."
Liar Liar,1997,6.9,A pathological liar-lawyer finds his career turned upside down when he inexplicably cannot physically lie for 24 whole hours.,"This movie is absolutely hilarious! There are few movies as humorous as this one, being ""Mousehunt"" one of those few - another 1997 motion picture.Every minute of ""Liar Liar"" is pure fun and every minute means a good laughter. Many moments are hysterical! Jim Carrey is often a great comedian, but this is him at his funniest side.The story is very funny and entertaining: Fletcher Reede, a lawyer with the habit of lying and breaking promises, suddenly sees himself forced to become honest during the next 24 hours after his son's birthday wish comes true. He doesn't understand what's happening to him and that is driving him insane... he can't tell any lies, not even write a little lie! Whenever he tries to and whenever he talks, it's a huge mess for sure! He even transforms the court room into a circus, seems to lose his mind and makes goofy faces! Incredibly hilarious!The actors have great performances. Jim Carrey is great as Fletcher Reede, but there are other equally good actors, like Maura Tierney as Audrey Reede, Cary Elwes as Jerry and little Justin Cooper as Max (Fletcher's son). Max is also referred to as ""Maximillian"" and ""Monster Max"" by his father, who loves to do ""The Claw"" much for his son's delight. I know Cary Elwes from ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" and I do know that he is an English actor, but he speaks with a good American accent in this film. Some might think that Jim Carrey overacts here and that his humor is too crummy, but the energy he shows here is not something anybody could do. It requires a very energetic and patient comedian and Jim Carrey proves his talent to do so. The kid is cute. He almost looks like Sean Marshall in ""Pete's Dragon"", with that face and long hair.At my point of view, ""Liar Liar"" has funny humor, not irritating or dirty humor. It is a modern light-hearted comedy. Its aim is purely fun at the highest level. I think it's difficult not laughing while watching this movie. Lots of very funny lines are another attribute.Directed by Tom Shadyac, ""Liar Liar"" is the best thing Jim Carrey and Tom Shadyac ever did together and slightly superior than the later ""Bruce Almighty""."
American Pie: The Wedding,2003,6.3,"It's the wedding of Jim and Michelle and the gathering of their families and friends, including Jim's old friends from high school and Michelle's little sister.","Despite an embarrassing scene at a restaurant, Jim proposes to his long-time girlfriend Michelle.  For their wedding Jim enlists the help of Finch and Kevin to make everything smooth ¬ñ and keep Stifler out of the way.  However a ceremony is hard work and is made harder when things just always seem to go wrong and when Stifler seems to be determined to f**k the bride's sister ¬ñ even if it means pretending to be mild mannered and polite.Trying to think about this film or the series itself is like trying to argue with mud, basically you just need to accept that this is a silly, stupid gross out comedy that relies on poor taste jokes and unlikely set ups.  If this is a problem for you then don't watch it.  If you have accepted it and are watching it then it all comes down to, is it a GOOD gross out comedy with poor taste jokes?  As much as I know I should be above it, I did laugh at the other 2 films and was happy to go and see this and, for the most part, I laughed at this.  However this was the weakest of the three and the silence in the cinema was quite often uncomfortable ¬ñ usually silence in a cinema is a good thing, but this was often an uncomfortable `I should be laughing more' type of silence.In my review of part 2 I said `lets not do a 3'.  Watching this I'm sort of glad they managed to do it but I can see the strain despite their best efforts.  The main set up sequences are gross and funny but the gaps between are where the silence comes, there ain't enough comedy to cover the whole film.  I'm not talking about the sweet stuff near the end, I just talking about all the scenes between the banner scenes.  Plus the sequences are very forced at times (many you can see coming for miles), but this isn't too bad as they still manage to be hilariously gross!  For those who like the nudity (and who didn't like the bi-sexual teasing scene from part 2?) there is a long sequence of strippers with large fake breasts, if that's your thing (I'm a man, so yes!) which is funny but also serves up the mandatory t&a. There are also some scenes that are TOO forced ¬ñ eg the dance in the gay bar is funny but is too long and feels like a good idea with average delivery.The film bravely loses something like half the cast and makes the film better in that regard.  In fact Kevin has so little to do that they could have lost his character all together.  However this is offset by the change to Stifler.  In the first 2 he is obnoxious and rude but he is also the brunt of more jokes than he is the punisher.  In the first half here, he is very rude and annoying and you hate him for how he treats his friends.  That makes all his early antics hard to laugh at because now all you can see is a jerk hurting people.  In the second half this is less of an issue as he changes a little and gets what's coming to him (and how!).  I have a theory that Scott knows he has been pigeon holed in this role and is desperate to get out of it ¬ñ in fact when I saw Bullet Proof Monk I did think to myself that he is just playing a kung-fu Stifler.  Knowing this I think he played Stifler at full volume so that his next role would be nowhere near this performance.  Thus he has a weird crazed sneer on his face, he is ultra cruel and rude and is a real jerk ¬ñ hard to laugh with (but luckily still easy to laugh at).The rest of the cast do quite well.  Biggs manages to make more of his role than the victim and is sensitive when he needs to be ¬ñ I think it will be hard for him to shake off Jim (pardon the pun) but he shows he can do acting when he needs to.  Hannigan's innocent girlie voice is a little grating now and doesn't sit with her image as a woman ¬ñ it suited her to be a geek. Luckily she doesn't have that much to do after the funny opening scene. Thomas is OK but Nicholas just kind of hangs around with a half smile of his face and nothing to do.  Levy is still brillant as Jim's Dad but misses his `awkward moment' relationship (which they give him with Michelle to repeat it).  Jones is eye candy and the return of Stifler's Mon (forget her name) is pointless and a mistake that is happily kept to a few moments.Overall this is as poor a film as you expect ¬ñ rude, in poor taste, lacking a strong plot or performances, but none of these things are really fair comments as the film still manages to be funny.  The character of Stifler makes the first half very hard to enjoy and there are too many bits that don't work or where I didn't laugh but I still laughed.  Many viewers will feel that the series has simply fizzled out despite it still being funny."
American Pie,1999,7.0,Four teenage boys enter a pact to lose their virginity by prom night.,"Reviewers say 'American Pie' is celebrated for its crude humor and exploration of teenage sexuality, with praise for its relatable characters and camaraderie. The film balances humor with sincere moments, showcasing teenage complexities. Performances by Jason Biggs and Eugene Levy are commended for adding depth. However, some criticize its predictability, reliance on shock value, and lack of character development. Despite this, its cultural impact and nostalgic value are frequently noted."
Lethal Weapon 2,1989,7.3,Riggs and Murtaugh are on the trail of South African diplomats who are using their immunity to engage in criminal activities.,"First of all this movie is almost as good as the original. It retains all of the elements that made the first film so darn entertaining and adds some new elements.As all actors from the first movie appear in the second one as well its pretty clear what you can expect acting wise and surprise, surprise: The acting is still stellar, close to perfection. Mel Gibson is always good and in the second installment of the series he gets to be a little more wild and add even more nuances to the character. For example we get to see Riggs hit on women which adds an entire new side to him as the side we saw in the first film was of him mourning. Also we find out how his wife dies in a beautifully underacted scene (if you want to know how she dies you'll have to see the movie). Danny Glover returns as well and he plays the character pretty much as he did in the first film which is good because the character he plays is the one who is not supposed to change. He is meant to be square and combined with the character of Riggs this becomes highly entertaining. However, a new element is put into the mix to make it even more entertaining, Leo Getz, played beautifully by Joe Pesci and is to this day still one of his most memorable characters. He is funny and fast talking but most importantly: he is a crook and when you put him together with Riggs and Murtaugh the mix becomes explosive. The main villains are played by Joss Ackland and Derrick O'Connor and they are also good and a bit more developed than the villains of the first movie obviously because they had to focus more on the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh in the first movie. Riggs' love interest is played Patsy Kensit and she is good if a bit underdeveloped.The story is excellent and is almost better than the story in the first one. It is entertaining and funny and best of all the incredible chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover is maintained and is almost as good as it was in the first movie. Furthermore the addition of Joe Pesci was a very nice touch because he immediately makes the scenes with him, Gibson and Glover even more interesting and entertaining. The plot with the villains is kept relatively simple like in the first film, which is good because the goal for the film is entertainment not to be thought provoking.The action of the film is kept in the same style as in the first movie and it is still both exhilarating and entertaining. The effects are still relatively realistic and this of course gives the movie a level of credibility that is sorely needed in many modern action movies.All in all a worthy sequel and an excellent film on its own.8/10"
Underworld: Awakening,2012,6.3,"When human forces discover the existence of the Vampire and Lycan clans, a war to eradicate both species commences. The vampire warrior Selene leads the battle against humankind.","Things go wrong here in the Underworld franchise. Only Selene, and a small part for Michael, is to be seen from the original cast. It do involves vampires and lycans but i just couldn't care for Awakening.Selene here is more an superhero than a vampire. She can do things not normal for a vampire and not be seen in the previous entries. The story itself was a bit weak too, guess the producers just wanted to earn some easy money. Selene is involved with Michael in an explosion. She wakes up twelve year later in a world were mankind wants to annihilate vampires and lycans. Once awake she sees that she's in a laboratory. She soon discovers that she has a daughter, Eve. But the lab is in fact part of lycans who want to use Eve's body to find a cure against silver bullets.I can agree that the story had to involve but don't bringing any cast from the last 3 entries is a fault for me. Also the fact that one lycan was a big monster was a bit exaggerated. If you want to see stuff like that then move over to the Resident Evil franchise. The effects on the other hand were maybe the best so far. But we are also a few years further than Rise Of The Lycans. It is still watchable but it moved too far away from the other flicks of Underworld. It do has an open ending so within a few years part 5 will be available. Only hope it moves back to Lucian, Victor and the others.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5"
The Longest Yard,2005,6.4,Prison inmates form a football team to challenge the prison guards.,"I too got to see a free-sneak peak of this film in NYC and I'll tell you one thing . . there were no sleepers in the cinema! A very mixed crowd from race to ages here and everyone seemed to be having a great time . . even the teenager who sat behind me who reminded me of every actor when he appeared on the screen .. like Nelly. I haven't had this much fun in the theater in quite awhile. No, it's not a super serious film, but if you like football and the good feeling of revenge you'll love this film. Lots of violent blows from the guards and a little racism, but nothing too ""out of the ordinary"" . . some great one-liners from Chris Rock's character. A definite #1 film for Memorial Day weekend when it opens. I can see this film bringing in some good dough this summer."
Toy Story,1995,8.3,"A cowboy doll is profoundly jealous when a new spaceman action figure supplants him as the top toy in a boy's bedroom. When circumstances separate them from their owner, the duo have to put aside their differences to return to him.","Reviewers say 'Toy Story' is acclaimed for its pioneering animation, compelling narrative, and universal themes of friendship. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen's performances elevate Woody and Buzz Lightyear, blending humor with emotional depth. Randy Newman's soundtrack, especially ""You've Got a Friend in Me,"" enhances the film's emotional resonance. Its innovative technology and storytelling have made it a cultural milestone and timeless classic in animation history."
Men in Black,1997,7.3,"James, an NYC cop, is hired by Agent K of a secret government agency that monitors extraterrestrial life on Earth. Together, they must recover an item that has been stolen by an intergalactic villain.","As my one line summary says, this is one of the best sci-fi comedies ever made, next to the classic Ghostbusters and the highly underrated Evolution. This movie has action, comedy, and some of the best special effects in the last ten years. Rick Baker, Hollywood's resident 'creature man', as I like to call him, has made such a wide variety of aliens. There's the first alien we see, Mikey; there's the Worm Guys; and the villanous Bug. But there are many others, such as Frank the Pug and the twins. The squid baby is pretty neat. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith have an undeniable chemistry together, which repeats itself in the sequel. Linda Fiorentino is also good as the leading lady, and veteran actor Rip Torn is gruff as the head of MIB, Zed. Vincent D'Onofrio is also pretty good. My favorite line: ""No, ma'am. We at the FBI do not have a sense of humor that we are aware of."" All in all, two thumbs up, baby!"
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,2009,6.9,A local scientist is often regarded as a failure until he invents a machine that can make food fall from the sky. But little does he know that things are about to take a turn for the worst.,"Truly great animation, with the expressions of the eyes reminiscent of anime. A story that is about the child within each of us, yet all the while considering the risks involved during the whole of life. This is a story about innocence, in the true meaning of ""knowing oneself completely"" and all that this implies. It is also a story very much about the importance of imagination and creativity.I am a child and an adult. What I've been taught, not entirely by just my fellow human beings, is that judgment is never productive. At its best, it is a desire to share with others something we do or do not appreciate. At its worst, it is a shutting down of the connection we have with each other. Perhaps a more productive way of sharing opinions about anything might be making distinctions between what is appreciated about the thing, and what is not, and the reasons for both aspects of these thoughts/feelings. This story actually addresses this tough issue, while entertaining us with a romp and a grand adventure.My appreciation of this film is that it inspires me to laugh at myself (it's quite funny), at us, and my culture. And all the while, it is kind. The story and animation are tremendously imaginative, a quality I've found missing in many stories, animated or not. One of the themes, if not the main thread of the story, is that we humans are creative beings, and that, while this involves risks, we must express our imagination or take the greater risk of becoming stuck, stale and static, living only in the past tense.The greatest compliment I can give this film is that I want my 2-year-old granddaughter to see it, for I am absolutely sure she will enjoy it almost as much as I have at age 61.Greg Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"
"Crazy, Stupid, Love.",2011,7.4,"A middle-aged husband's life changes dramatically when his wife asks him for a divorce. He seeks to rediscover his manhood with the help of a newfound friend, Jacob, learning to pick up girls at bars.","When it all comes together in an ensemble romantic comedy, it takes a great script, spot-on casting, inspired acting, timing, synergy, and brilliant direction. Crazy, Stupid Love has it all. Arguably, the best romantic-comedy of the new millennium era, CSL synchronized two directors and a screenwriter who had all previously been noted for their top success in animation films and television including the 'Cars' franchise, 'Tangled' and 'Angry Beavers' (in addition to non-animation film), along with the brilliant Casting Director Icon Cindy Marin who had casted 'Juno' a few years earlier.The casting could not have been better, and with the inclusion of Kevin Bacon, connects the film (within 7-degrees of Bacon) to generations of great romantic comedies.I can count on one hand the number of great romantic comedies in film since 2000 - they are rare, hard to pull off, and this is one of the very best. TV Series are a much better platform for comedy, as the comic moments can be spliced together without having the wrap a complete linear story around it in just two hours - TV is 30 minutes of gags; next episode.Pulling-off a quality 2-hour story like this one, within the comedy genre (that is both sexy-sweet and funny at the same time;) requires effectively synchronizing a lot of moving parts.Everyone involved in the production of CSL brought their A-Game, and it shows.The key tandem in the film's success is Steve Carrell/Ryan Gosling - Without those two delivering the goods, the film would have failed.They deliver big-time, making this Buddy-Film disguised as a Romantic-Comedy an all-time film arts success.The Carrell/Gosling best-buddy relationship centers around a man in his 40's (Carrell) in the process of being separated from his middle-school sweetheart and first-and-only-love wife (Julianne Moore), reluctantly entering the modern singles dating world for the first time in his life.He is completely unprepared and out of step with the times and the game, but runs into the Yoda or ""Miyagi"" master of ladies-men (Gosling) at a popular local singles bar, who decides to take him under his wing and mentor him in the ways of successfully meeting younger women after observing his wallowing in breakup pain and ineptitude in the singles game. The Pygmalion-like tutoring and transformation is truly brilliant fun to watch.A complex intertwining connection of the entire cast starts to reveal itself piece by piece, and the hilarious apex of the film is one of the most memorable pay-off moments in comedy-film history.The supporting cast orbits around the two new-best-friend buddies, and their acting excellence results in CSL rating as one of the all-time great ensemble comedies.This was the first of three (as of 2021) successful movie pairings of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, each subsequent project propelling both into higher orbits of superstardom - the third pairing 'La La Land' resulted in multiple award nominations, including an Oscar win for Stone, and with Hollywoods penchant for staying with winning formulas, it is likely we shall see more of these two together in film.CSL fits the new millennial era culture well, and perhaps years from now will seem dated to this period (filmed right before the dating App explosion that occurred from 2012-2015 that replaced and swiped-away bar meetups, it is already aging in that regard). This just means everyone ""got it"" during its production, and certainly transferred that ""get"" to the screen with notable comic skill.On my IMDb list of Top 25 Best Comedy Buddy Films.Needless to say, I ""highly recommended"" 'Crazy, Stupid Love', and give it the proverbial two thumbs up! üëçüëç"
Iron Man,2008,7.9,"After being held captive in an Afghan cave, billionaire engineer Tony Stark creates a unique weaponized suit of armor to fight evil.","Reviewers say 'Iron Man' is lauded for its engaging character development, especially Tony Stark's evolution. Robert Downey Jr.'s charismatic performance is a highlight, balancing action, humor, and drama effectively. The chemistry between Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow is praised, though Obadiah Stane is seen as underdeveloped. Themes of corporate responsibility and technology are noted, contributing to the film's strong MCU debut."
Double Team,1997,4.8,An international spy teams up with an arms dealer to escape from a penal colony and rescue his family from a terrorist.,"A logic-free action flick that stretches plausibility way beyond breaking point, Double Team stars Jean-Claude Van Damme as counter-terrorist expert Jack Quinn who, after a botched mission to kill international terrorist Stavros (Mickey Rourke), becomes an unwilling participant in a top secret think-tank on a remote island colony for agents that are considered 'too valuable to kill, but too dangerous to set free'.When Stavros (Mickey Rourke) abducts Jack's pregnant wife, having vowed revenge for the accidental death of his son during the earlier shootout, Jack escapes the colony, seeks help from an S&M freak gun dealer named Yaz (played by eccentric basketball bad-boy Dennis Rodman), and embarks on a dangerous rescue mission that culminates in an explosive showdown inside a coliseum.Opening with Quinn escaping from some bad guys by jumping a heavily armoured stolen vehicle through a speeding train (without the aid of a ramp), this film is completely crazy from the get go, and Hong Kong director Tsui Hark doesn't let the insanity subside until the very end, chucking in such spectacular nonsense as Van Damme kicking the crap out of bad guys while hanging from an air-plane cargo net, a Chinese killer who uses his knife with his foot, a top secret society of cyber-monks, and a finale that sees the good guys fight a tiger in the middle of a mine field before escaping certain death from fireball through the use of a Coke vending machine.Special mention must also be made of the incredible amount of glass that gets smashed during the film (usually because someone has been thrown through it).Although I'll never quite understand how this film got green-lit, I'm sure glad it did: a more enjoyably insane piece of 90s nonsense you'll be hard pushed to find.Call me crazy, but I rate Double Team 8 out of 10 simply for being so bloody silly."
The Tourist,2010,6.0,A tourist on the train to Venice is approached by a mysterious woman for an unusual reason.,"Two beautiful people race around Venice in this entertaining and deceptive game of Cat and Mouse.There's a very charming and seductive quality to this film. And its more subtle execution of the Action-Thriller genre is, I think, very underrated. Along with good pacing and twists that kept me guessing, The Tourist made for an enjoyable time."
2 Fast 2 Furious,2003,5.9,Former cop Brian O'Conner is called upon to bust a dangerous criminal and he recruits the help of a former childhood friend and street racer who has a chance to redeem himself.,"What made the first ""The Fast and the Furious"" movie attracted fans besides the bad ass cars and competition on the streets was Vin Diesel's appearance as Dominic Toretta, a hotshot race driver who makes his money racing others in the streets; he was a rising star on the fame after doing such flicks such as ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""The Iron Giant"" and later doing ""XXX"".At the end of the first movie, Vin's character Dominic flees away to Mexico where he wouldn't be in this sequel.No matter, the series continues on.""2 Fast 2 Furious"" has Paul Walker reprising his role as Brian O'Conner, the one time agent who betrayed the enforcement agency by letting Dominic get away, is now a fugitive and being in a race competitions every night to make money. After being captured by the police, Brian is given a choice in either going to jail or helped the people he once work for in taking down a drug cartel dealer (Cole Hauser). Brian agrees under one condition that he gets his childhood friend Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson, Transformers) involved since he's into cars and knows his ways around tough people. They're also given an ally, the sexy Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) who's not only an undercover agent but also posing as the enemy's mistress. Time will tell when all will be revealed.""2 Fast 2 Furious"" is directed by John Singleton of Boyz in the Hood fame where he manages to bring the same energy and high expectations of the first movie. There's more cars, more chase sequences, more babes and more cameos this time around with a high octane pace.Overall, it's good."
Dubbel & dwars,1998,6.7,"Identical twins Annie and Hallie, separated at birth and each raised by one of their biological parents, discover each other for the first time at summer camp and make a plan to bring their wayward parents back together.","School holidays can be deadly for older cinema patrons but sometimes there are films for children that are well worth a visit for adults. Unusually, The Parent Trap is a children's film that can even be recommended for children by the most morally bound parent - although there is a divorce that may need to be explained away. The Parent Trap is cute, sugary and funny  - and unashamedly so. The Parent Trap was originally made in 1961 starring Haley Mills as a pair of twins who accidentally meet when they are eleven years old. Their parents divorced when they were babies. They then connive to get their parents back together. This is classic Disney material and the formula can and does work very well indeed in this modern version. Heaven only knows how the special effects are done but I suggest that you just forget about that and settle back and enjoy the film. You won't have any choice anyway. I was convinced that the twins must have been played by real life twins and I'm sure that I won't be the only one to fall for that particular Parent Trap. Young Lindsay Lohan plays the girls, (both of them!) complete with fabulous accents, sunny bright and distinctive personalities, appealing red hair, freckles and a great sense of fun. One of the girls has become a Londoner and one a Californian and the girls also sport very commendable English and American accents, as well as composites of the two accents when the girls switch places. It's also pleasing to see young girls being given the sorts of lightly rebellious antics to frolic with as are usually reserved for young boys. The story begins in a New England summer camp where practical jokes are the go, although the film is careful to keep nastiness well out of the way. It would be hard to accuse Lindsay Lohan's twins of any serious crime in any case. The girls decide to switch places so they can each meet their Mum and Dad. In true Hollywood style both parents are rich and attractive and they of course each have hired help (Lisa Anne Walter and Simon Kunz) who are of course are going to fall in love. But then we must have the wicked stepmother and this is provided by Meredith, a gold digger who's out to score the very rich hand of Dad. She's played with appropriate relish by Sharon Stone look alike Elaine Hendrix. The story really revolves around the parents, played by Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid. We can settle back and wait for the inevitable to happen, because we just know that this is going to be one of those ""happily ever after"" efforts where Mummy and Daddy will again fall in love and properly become parents for these two very cute and loving girls. But along the way be prepared for some very solid laughs and a wonderfully animated and motivated lizard."
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,1985,6.2,"After being exiled from the most advanced town in post-apocalyptic Australia, a drifter travels with a group of abandoned children to rebel against the town's queen.","The first half of this film -- the part with Bartertown, Thunderdome, etc -- is brilliant, not just a repeat of THE ROAD WARRIOR but a totally new concept, thoroughly fleshed out. The second half, with the lost children, isn't as good -- and, more to the point, doesn't quite mesh with the first half, despite Miller's attempts to tie it all together at the end. Still, it's well above average in  a genre that has increasingly come to believe (wrongly) that special effects are more important than plot and character."
Minority Report,2002,7.6,"John works with the PreCrime police which stop crimes before they take place, with the help of three 'PreCogs' who can foresee crimes. Events ensue when John finds himself framed for a future murder.","Before they joined forces to give sci-fi fans their hugely disappointing version of War Of The Worlds, Spielberg and Cruise worked together on Minority Report, a near-future tale based on a short story by Philip K. Dick in which violent crimes can be predicted and prevented from occurring, the perpetrator intercepted before they can carry out the deed. Star Cruise plays pre-crime cop John Anderton, who finds himself on the run after it is predicted that he himself will commit a murder.The good news is that Minority Report is a lot more enjoyable than the duo's H.G.Wells debacle, with an engrossing murder mystery plot, lots of great visuals, excellent production design, and some well executed and extremely fun action set-pieces, all of which help detract from the story's inevitable paradoxical issues and Spielberg's occasional, frustratingly unrestrained direction (Cruise leaping from car roof to car roof on a towering vertical road stretches plausibility a bit too far, but at least it's not 'nuke the fridge' bad).7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for the 'sick stick' a police baton that makes the victim projectile vomit."
Independence Day,1996,7.0,"The aliens are coming and their goal is to invade and destroy Earth. Fighting superior technology, mankind's best weapon is the will to survive.","Independence Day is the sort of film that's best appreciated on a big screen, preferably a massive great plasma television that is so huge you had to cut the roof off your house and get airlifted in by helicopters just to get it in the living room. You should also have the most state of the art surround sound possible, with bass pickups so deep they cause earthquakes on the Eastern seaboard. Not because Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's alien invasion flick is a masterpiece of cinematic art or anything, but because it's loud. Very loud. And if the windows in your house don't shatter when the spaceship flies over New York then well, you're just not experiencing it properly.Taking the 1950's invasion narratives and pro-tooling them for 90's audiences, Independence Day is an absolute blast of visual flare and gung ho heroism. The plot is so straightforward as to be superfluous (aliens invade, fights ensue) but even so, it remains an invigorating watch purely because of the spectacle it provides. Back in 1996, the sight of that giant blue laser tearing apart lower Manhattan made jaws drop and while it's unlikely to do the same to today's overstimulated audiences, it's still an incredible visual feast. What's more, the ensemble cast makes it surprisingly unpredictable - we all know that the aliens will be defeated at the end, but what isn't so obvious is which characters are going to be alive to see it. Except for the kid and the dog. They're relatively safe bets.Watching it now though, it does possess a cheerful naivety in the face of world politics. After all, this was 1996, the Cold War was over and 9/11 a long way off, so the entire world uniting against a common foe without being bogged down with petty arguments and personal agendas still seemed believable. Hell, even the gun-toting Arabs that briefly appear on screen are more than happy to rally behind Uncle Sam in the name of freedom. That's right folks, it's an Americans Save The World movie, complete with a snapshot of British officers drinking tea in the desert and waiting for those silly yanks to get a bally move on and show us what to do.Needless to say, this is blockbuster entertainment through and through. The aliens are apparently here to strip mine the planet of all her natural resources, but they're quite happy to put that off for a bit in order to blow things up for the entire running time. Fans of in-depth characterisation, intelligent story telling and emotional engagement with the protagonists are wasting their time, but if you want to watch tourist attractions, jet planes and space craft exploding for three hours, you can't really go wrong. That business about a computer virus bringing down the mother-ship is a bit daft though, not once did they try switching everything on and off again."
Ghost Rider,2007,5.3,A motorcycle stuntman who sold his soul becomes a supernatural agent of vengeance.,Yea it isn't anything revolutionary but it was fun. Definitely elevated by Nicolas Cage.
Highlander III: The Sorcerer,1994,4.5,"Deceived that he had won the Prize, Connor MacLeod awakens from a peaceful life when an entombed immortal magician comes seeking the Highlander.","A good revenge plot drives this third Highlander installment. An old enemy similar to the Kurgan of the first film, escapes an entombment after 400 years and begins a quest for the head of McLeod. Kane- the Sorceror -makes a great villain and blends into modern America easily with his tattoos and piercings. The film also boasts some Conan elements with Mako again playing a wizard named Nagano and there also some f/x similar to T-2 as the sorceror's power is made apparent. Debra Unger is also a plus as a smokin' leading lady who provides the best and sweatiest sex scene of the ""Highlander"" cycle. There are also some great locales used in the film. From snowy Japan to African deserts to the Scottish Highlands, the film features all three beautifully. McLeod also has an adopted son and is hounded by a new NYC detective who is wise to his immortal habits. But through it all, he keeps his cool demeanor. However, the soundtrack leaves much to be desired. 7/10. Check out the DVD!"
Collateral,2004,7.5,A cab driver finds himself the hostage of an engaging contract killer as he makes his rounds from hit to hit during one night in Los Angeles.,"This one's exactly as the DVD sleeve description says, dedicated assassin ""Vincent (Tom Cruise) is a cool, calculating contract killer at the top of his game. Max (Jamie Foxx) is a cabbie with big dreams and little to show for it. Now, Max has to transport Vincent on his next job - one night, five stops, five hits and a getaway. And after this fateful night, neither man will ever be the same again. Tonight everything is changing¬Ö"" You quickly get used to the change in hair dye.The fact that some awards givers, including members of the ""Golden Globes"" and ""Academy Awards"" organizations, considered Mr. Foxx as the year's ""Best Supporting Actor"" really calls their legitimacy and reputation into question. You've got to wonder if these people are even watching the movies. Foxx an above-the-title STAR of the film; for anyone napping during the running time, it's confirmed during the end credits. By the way, how could you nap during this film?DreamWorks produces writer Stuart Beattie's plot in delirious style. ""Collateral"" is a visual treat, thanks to director Michael Mann plus cinematographers Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron. The James Newton Howard music is perfect. These filmmakers make Los Angeles a sprawling, empty vessel in which to pour Mr. Beattie's moody psychological character clash. The real supporting players, Jada Pinkett Smith (as Annie Farrell) and Mark Ruffalo (as Fanning) are great.******** Collateral (8/5/04) Michael Mann ~ Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, Jada Pinkett Smith, Mark Ruffalo"
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,2006,6.1,A teenager becomes a major competitor in the world of drift racing after moving in with his father in Tokyo to avoid a jail sentence in America.,"Look behind the woeful accent and this is actually a good movie. The first F&F was about racing, then went all Miami Vice. A final return to the street racing scene had to move away from the original cast as they had lost their 'From the streets' appeal.Anyway back to this, some sweet cars that aren't the massively expensive hyper cars of later episodes and some trick driving to boot.A quality film if you manage to watch it a couple of times and don't dwell on the accent."
National Treasure,2004,6.9,A historian races to find the legendary Templar Treasure before a team of mercenaries.,"This was a fun film, sort of like an Indian Jones movie, but the treasure hunter must figure out clues. I'm sure the reason this was made and released now has a lot to do with the Da Vinci Code. The plot is just like it except instead of involving religious history, the clues center around American history, and namely the founding fathers.So Nick Cage, plays Ben Gates, the treasure hunter whose family has been looking for the treasure of the knights templer for years. One of his relatives possessed the last remaining clue from a dying Mason. So, the movie starts with Cage finally solving that clue, and the film goes from there. Of course, we have the evil billionaire guy who wants the treasure for himself and the funny sidekick. But, I think the sidekick failed because he wasn't all that funny. The movie could have used some more humor. And of course, Gates hooks up with a beautiful woman along the way to help him solve the clues, which sounds just like Da Vinci.It is unbelievable that someone could just come up with the answer to these difficult clues after thinking about them for 2 minutes, but we don't have time to let the characters ponder them for a few months. It is meant to be fun, so forget about the plot holes. The whole set beneath the church looked very neat, but I would have to think all those wooden stairs would have been rotten by then and no one could walk on them. But who cares, it's fun.And the theft of the Declaration of Independence was reminiscent of Ocean's 11. Funny how anyone can steal anything in a film, forget locked down security.FINAL VERDICT: If you like adventure films, I recommend it. It is not like Tomb Raider, which some have compared it to. Tomb Raider was horrible. This is more like Indiana Jones."
Brokeback Mountain,2005,7.7,"Two shepherds fall for each other, but their relationship becomes complicated when they both get married to their respective girlfriends.","Reviewers say 'Brokeback Mountain' evokes profound emotions, exploring love, loneliness, and societal repression. The film is praised for powerful storytelling, exceptional acting, and beautiful cinematography. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal's performances are highlighted for depth and authenticity. However, some find the pacing slow and the plot lacking. The portrayal of a same-sex relationship in a conservative setting is both celebrated for its boldness and critiqued for lacking emotional depth. Overall, 'Brokeback Mountain' is seen as significant and impactful, though opinions on its execution vary."
In Time,2011,6.7,"In a future where people stop aging at 25, but are engineered to live only one more year, having the means to buy your way out of the situation is a shot at immortal youth. Will Salas is accused of murder and on the run with a hostage.","This is a really cool idea for a film. A day in the future when the commodity of value is not cash or gold, it is time. Everyone gets to live to age 25. After that you have one year to live, or less. It all depends upon whether you use all your time credits or you earn more. Regardless, if you live to age 100, or longer, your body physically remains looking twenty five.On the plus side is Justin Timberlake coming back and showing that his misstep in Bad Teacher (2011) was just one of those embarrassing Hollywood screw ups. Timberlake has real drama and acting talent and is definitely here for the long haul. (Too bad Elvis was never given such chances.) Timberlake gave us a glimpse of his depth last year in The Social Newtwork (2010) , but his talents were not fully developed for Friends with Benefits (2011).The script starts with the eerie, sobering reminder, and all too familiar words, ""We don't have time...we don't have time..."" Think if today you had to buy everything with time, instead of bank credit or cash. Coffee costs four minutes. A bus ride costs an hour. A car costs two years. People can give or take time from each other. Just don't run out of time or you will die on the spot. If this were real, would you treasure and spend time more wisely? The real interesting question may be that time really is the currency we live by now, we just fail to see it that way. The simple fact is that you can earn countless piles of cash and gold in this world, but you really cannot buy time. Despite the wealthy in today's world sometimes being able to cheat a few years with better health care, we all are going to die in the same average years.While the script is the superficial tale of Will Salas (Timberlake) and his Mom (Wilde) trying to pass time in a futuristic world, the messages of the film go far deeper. It is really a tale of class warfare. People who have time, like the mega ""eonaire"" Phillipe Weis (Katheiser) and his rich daughter Sylvia (Seyfried) and those who constantly struggle to keep time (or run out of it) like the Salas family. Will gets the chance to move up into a better time zone thanks to a man who has just decided that after a hundred years or so, he prefers to ""time out."" He leaves Will the prophetic warning ""Don't waste my time."" How Will chooses to spend his time, for himself or for the benefit of all, is now the story.I really did not mind that the future depicted in this film was not futuristic looking and all the cars were vintage 1970's models with updated lighting and electric sounding motors. It saved a huge budget rather than try to make the world look like it probably will in 2013 or so. And I think the point was that the future is really now.As an entertaining film, my 7.5 rating is spot on. As a thought provoking experience, I might have given it a 10.0. After seeing this film, you should go out and visit with friends. Your own clock is ticking down. Are you really using it wisely? Unlike the time down clock on the arm of the people in this film, you never know when your time is about up.This film...it's worth your time."
Rise of the Planet of the Apes,2011,7.6,A substance designed to help the brain repair itself gives advanced intelligence to a chimpanzee who leads an ape uprising.,"I had extremely low expectations for Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011). I loved the original 1968 classic, but every sequel/remake after it sucked. I was surprised they were going to make a prequel of the classic and I thought it was a good idea. But still after so many bad sequels and remakes, I still had my big doubts. Also I didn't like how the monkeys were made by CGI/Special Effects, why not use a robotic monkey or a real one, it would look more real.After my viewing of the film, I was pleasantly surprised and I liked it overall. But there were definitely flaws in the movie, no doubt about it. The characters were a bit uninteresting at times, there were subplots that went pretty much nowhere and indicated that there could sequels in the works, but it all depends on how much money it makes. The movie, at some points turned to an average summer blockbuster with all the action scenes and explosions, but it redeems itself later on.However there are plenty of positive qualities, the movie has. Andy Serkis delivers a great performance as the lead ape in the film and is pretty much the star of the film. James Franco and Freida Pinto, both did a good job portraying their characters. The movie also poses ethical/moral questions, which I found very interesting. The movie is easily on of the most thrilling films we've had this summer. Finally a movie that pays respect to the 1968 original science fiction classic!"
I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry,2007,5.9,"Two straight, single Brooklyn firefighters pretend to be a gay couple in order to receive domestic partner benefits.","This is a film where Adam Sandler literally tries too hard to act manly and cool. This is a very stereotypical movie with a lot of gay jokes thrown in, and has some sexist images of women. Charles ""Chuck"" Levine (Sandler) and Lawrence ""Larry"" Valentine (James) are veteran FDNY fire fighters. And during there routine Chuck almost gets killed and Larry saves his life. Soon Larry realizes he has difficulties naming his children as primary beneficiaries in his life insurance due to the death of his wife. So in order to get his benefit he needs to get married. Larry asks Chuck to enter a pretend marriage with him after Larry read a article about domestic partnerships. Chuck declines at first, but is reminded of his debt to Larry so he agrees. The main highlight of this film is when Alex McDonough(Jessica Biel) is thrown into the mix, who play Chuck and Larry's lawyer. I however disliked Adam Sandler in this movie, he just tries way too hard to prove he isn't gay in this film to point it gets a bit annoying and he is like banging every girl that crosses his path in this one, yeah firemen get girls but c'mon. At times it had it's moments and had some funny jokes but it really drags and don't know how to quit. I think it would have been awesome if Chuck and Larry eventually found out they are gay for each other cause Chuck is a sleazy gay character, but I doubt Adam Sandler would do it since he has such a high image of himself which I realized after I finished watching this movie. Basically the film is about Adam Sandler trying really hard to look manly, while there is a bunch of stereotypical gay jokes thrown in. Jessica Biel was really hot and attractive in this and is the main highlight of this film and finds herself in many situations in her underwear. Which is the main point, but her assets is a nice touch, so I can't complain.5.5/10"
Love Actually,2003,7.5,"Follows the lives of eight very different couples in dealing with their love lives in various loosely interrelated tales all set during a frantic month before Christmas in London, England.","This movie does come off as a bit shallow, and it contains characters who are one- dimensional caricatures of themselves. But guess what -- this movie is clearly in the romantic, holiday fantasy genre -- just like It's a Wonderful Life and A Christmas Story are. And most people love those movies, so I don't get all the negative reviewing of this film. To me, this movie is clearly a fantasy piece, and as such it should not be subject to all the driveling negativity that would better be directed toward something terrible that masquerades as serious dramatic work. Would the British PM ever go knocking door to door with just one bodyguard? No Way! Do Londoners actually care what song is ""number one for Christmas"" more than Americans do?? (I'm seriously doubting it -- who other than a few teenagers and record promoters actually cares about charts?) This is clearly a work that's not to be taken as a ""serious"" movie, though it's seriously fun if you'll take it for the fantasy that it is.I love this film. Despite the clearly fantastic story lines, I like the characters, and the amazing A-list cast does a great job. I caught it first in theatrical release, then I watched it three times back to back on a plane to London because the other choices were the abysmal ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" and ""Duplex."" Since I've caught it on HBO, and I've quickly realized it's one of those movies you can watch repeatedly when flipping channels for a quick ""pick me up"" that only fantasy movies can provide. My favorite movie of that sort is Groundhog Day, if that clues you into my argument.The multi-threaded storytelling in this borrows from the likes of Magnolia, and the fact that it's a light hearted holiday theme flick place that device in interesting contrast.I see Love Actually as a new holiday classic."
The Day After Tomorrow,2004,6.5,"Jack Hall, paleoclimatologist, must make a daring trek from Washington, D.C. to New York City to reach his son, trapped in the cross-hairs of a sudden international storm which plunges the planet into a new Ice Age.","The Day After Tomorrow is not a bad movie by all means. In fact, it's an uneven but decent film. The film does start off absolutely brilliantly, with a wonderful idea for a story and truly spectacular special effects. As a matter of fact, the whole film is well worth watching for the special effects alone. The acting is not too bad; Jake Gyllanhaal is rather bland, but Dennis Quaid is a superb lead. Plus Emmy Rosum looks positively radiant and Ian Holm is as reliable as ever. The direction from Roland Emmerich was surprisingly good, there have been times when I have found his direction too murky and unfocused, but no it was above decent here.However, the second half isn't as impressive. Whereas the first half is very like a typical disaster movie, the second half for me as it focused on the rescue mission felt more of a thriller. The screenplay in general could have done with more precision and focus too, there is good interplay sometimes but on the whole I found the screenplay and some of the characters underdeveloped. My main problem though with The Day After Tomorrow was the pace, for my liking it was too leisurely and too stodgy.All in all, uneven it is but it is a decent disaster movie. The first half I can watch again and again, but the second half for me was a bit of a letdown. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
Knocked Up,2007,6.9,"For fun-loving party animal Ben Stone, the last thing he ever expected was for his one-night stand to show up on his doorstep eight weeks later to tell him she's pregnant with his child.","I went into the theater not knowing what to expect, not having seen the trailer, and two hours later I felt I had seen a decent movie, quite funny at times, but I couldn't figure out what everyone was making such a big deal about. Compared to a lot of what passes for comedy in the cinema these days, Knocked Up is great, but it's hardly the ""instant classic"" that I've seen it called in many professional and IMDb reviews. It's certainly worth seeing, but maybe at a discount matin√©e instead of a full-price evening show.Much of what is wrong with Knocked Up is simply an over-reliance on Seth Rogen to deliver the laughs. To be sure, Rogen is a funny guy - he handled the jump from second-tier supporting actor (a la 40 Year Old Virgin) to leading man surprisingly well, appearing confident and charismatic. The problem is that as the film goes on, he just doesn't get a whole lot to work with from his supporting cast. Rogen doesn't have enough in him at this point to carry an entire film on his shoulders, but often he is forced into that role, providing the only humor in many scenes (especially in the second half of the movie). At times it almost seems as if Rogen has landed in the wrong film, delivering clever quips and laughs while the barely-likable characters around him remain too serious. Paul Rudd manages to break this up, taking some of the burden off Rogen, but Katherine Heigl and Leslie Mann's unfunny and quasi-sympathetic characters drag them down.To be sure, the first half of Knocked Up is great, but by the second half the script becomes mired in slow, clich√© drama. Marital dissatisfaction and the loss of youth are interesting themes to explore, but in doing so, Knocked Up fails to establish a consistent tone. As the film trudges past the 90-minute mark, it is sometimes humorous, sometimes dour, often clich√©d, all resulting in an awkward mix of styles.Overall, Knocked Up was a good effort, but a little more editing of the script would have helped a lot. I don't mind long movies at all, but 20 minutes could have been trimmed from this film to good effect."
My Week with Marilyn,2011,6.9,"Colin Clark, an employee of Sir Laurence Olivier, documents the tense interactions between Olivier and Marilyn Monroe during the production of The Prince and the Showgirl (1957).","'My Week With Marilyn' had much going for it, considering the cast pedigree and the subject. It is always hard making biographical dramas of actresses known for their beauty or portraying the actresses themselves, as evidenced by the wildly variable executions of how well they come off or not.Whether it is a completely truthful account of Marilyn Monroe's life at this chapter of her life or not was never going to cloud my judgement of how to rate and review 'My Week With Marilyn'. What mattered much more was how the film fared on its own two feet, and 'My Week With Marilyn' fares mostly very well and is beguiling stuff. Not one of the greatest biopics ever made (in a list that includes 'Amadeus' and 'The Elephant Man') but generally of the portrayals of actresses known for their classic beauty it's one of the better-faring ones.By all means, there are flaws. The direction can be rather blandly workmanlike and there is too much of a heavy-footed feel that jars with the lightness of the material itself. The film has a tendency to drag in the more intimate scenes with Monroe and Clark, which does suffer from occasional disjointed-ness, some trite moments and lack of chemistry at times.Julia Ormond is also badly miscast as Vivien Leigh, it is a very phoned in and indifferent performance that anybody not familiar with the actress herself but is aware of her reputation will question her appeal, she is also somewhat too healthy-looking (but also not beautiful enough) for a woman plagued with physical and mental health problems in her later years. To a lesser extent, Dominic Cooper struck me as too young and doesn't have much to do to really register.However, 'My Week With Marilyn' looks wonderful. The production and costume design were among the most visually exquisite and evocatively designed of that year, the period is perfectly evoked that it's like you've been transported back in time and are actually there and it's a beautifully shot film (not as incredible of that for 'The Tree of Life' and 'Hugo' but close). The soundtrack brilliantly and beautifully captures the mood of the film, it's sensitively composed without being too low-key and never intrusive or too made for television. It's also evocative of the period.Not everything in the script works, there are some trite and disjointed parts but they are far outweighed by the very thought-provoking, funny and sincere ones, it's fluff but very charming fluff. The storytelling drags occasionally, but is also very entertaining and heartfelt with the scenes with Monroe and Laurence Olivier being particularly intriguing and well done.Ormond aside, the acting is very good. Michelle Williams allures and completely captivates as Monroe herself, blending a sultriness, childlike lust and a darker and more destructive nature seamlessly. She matched by Kenneth Branagh's spot-on Olivier, being hilarious, sympathetic and believable in his exasperation, Judi Dench's splendid Dame Sybil and Zoe Wanamaker's gleefully scene-stealing and wonderfully stern turn. Dougray Scott has been criticised by some, personally had little problem with him, and there is much more of a resemblance to him as Arthur Miller than Ormond as Leigh, other than his American accent being overdone.Eddie Redmayne gives a very sensitive portrayal in a role deliberately not written as interestingly as the rest, as, despite being the film's heart, he is not the film's focus and was never intended to be as meaty as Monroe or Olivier.On the most part, 'My Week With Marilyn' was very worthwhile and beguiling. Well worth the time, as long as watched as a film on its own two feet and not as a history lesson. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
Good Bye Lenin!,2003,7.7,"In 1990, to protect his fragile mother from a fatal shock after a long coma, a young man must keep her from learning that her beloved nation of East Germany as she knew it has disappeared.","Last night I watched it for the second time. I'd seen it at the cinema two years ago, then last night my boyfriend, who hadn't seen it, decided to rent it. I loved it first time round, I loved it second time round, maybe even a tad more than I did originally. With wonderfully engaging characters all round, the film is endowed with a great sense of humour, both visual and verbal (and those Europhobic old Brits keep going on about how the Germans have no sense of humour!), it's socially relevant yet easier to watch than a straight comedy. The script is intelligent yet accessible to anyone, even a shallow teenager with no attention span whatsoever... yet IT is never shallow. And most of all, it's a deeply moving little gem of a film which however never abuses its secure grip on the heart-strings. I could see even my boyfriend was dewy-eyed at some points! And so was I, even more than two years ago. A small but perfectly formed film, it's actually not as small as one might think at first impact. Love (specifically, filial love) is its main theme, treated in a schmaltz-free, fresh, non-superficial and a non-clich√©d manner."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,2003,6.3,"John Connor must face a female Terminator with power over all the machines. But a new Terminator unit, a T-850, is sent back through time to help guide him through the coming battle.","This movie doesn't deserve the hate it's getting. Now obviously it isn't as good as the first two Terminator movies. But this is also what's ""wrong"" with it. It's a great movie, but if you compare it to 1 and 2 then of course it won't be great, simply because the two first just are that great and legendary movies.
But - as I wrote - it certainly doesn't deserve the hate.
80% - 8/10"
Underworld: Rise of the Lycans,2009,6.5,"A prequel centered on the origins of the centuries-old feud between the race of aristocratic vampires and their former slaves, the Lycans.","""Rise of the Lycans"", on the surface, makes a perfectly well working prequel. The loss of Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman is compensated by a great Rhona Mitra and especially Michael Sheen's titanic effort. The look and the action are amazing, considering the somewhat lower budget, and the story makes sense to prepare us all for the things to come in the other two movies. All in all, the trilogy is round now and does not disappoint in any department, unless you are taking everything a bit too literally and wonder how werewolves can make babies.It is interesting, however, to peek below the surface. The makers mentioned in interviews they see similarities to ""Romeo & Juliet"" insofar as Lucien and Sonja are lovers not allowed to get together. One crucial difference, however, is that Romeo and Juliet came from two noble families, whereas in ""Rise of the Lyans"", Sonja is a member of the aristocratic pale vampire rulers, who are sipping glasses of blood on the castle, while Lucien is with the ugly, hairy slaves, the werewolves exploited as cheap labor force. We don't really get to see what this work consists of except carrying stones around. Also the love story isn't explained enough in the running time of not much more than 80 minutes PAL until the credits start to roll. But the point is that ""Rise of the Lycans"" is a hardly disguised class struggle story. Similar to the Italian socialist cinema of the 1960s which would show the rebellion of poor farmers against the rich property owners, the working class has to realise their value (in Lucien's words: ""we are more than animals"") and claim their human rights. When Lucien says ""this is just the beginning"", it may seem to the audience that he jokingly refers to other other two movies which have shown us already how the story continues after this prequel. In the subtext, though, he is making a very serious statement that freedom is the foundation of a life worth living, and everything else will be built up now upon this basic condition. It's a pity that the movie doesn't elaborate more on that and doesn't spend some additional time on the character development, either, because it could have been the best of the trilogy. Alas, I voted almost equally 8-7-7 for the three movies."
The Incredible Hulk,2008,6.6,"Bruce Banner, a scientist on the run from the U.S. Government, must find a cure for the monster he turns into whenever he loses his temper.","Reviewers say 'The Incredible Hulk' is lauded for its action and Edward Norton's performance, yet criticized for over-reliance on CGI and uneven pacing. Supporting characters, especially Liv Tyler's Betty Ross, are seen as underdeveloped. The film's tone fluctuates, though it is appreciated for its nods to the original series and comics, and its place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
Safe House,2012,6.7,"A young CIA agent is tasked with looking after a fugitive in a safe house. But when the safe house is attacked, he finds himself on the run with his charge.","It's an interesting albeit predictable action flick that's nothing special but delivers enough to make it worthwhile. It does feature what has to be the dumbest CIA operatives/handlers ever put on film. What transpires, especially early, will make most viewers say ""why in the world didn't they just¬Ö"" but getting past that means enjoying a film where Denzel Washington perfectly menaces and charms his way through every scene. Put just about anyone else in this role and the film would lose a lot. Ryan Reynolds was good enough and the rest of the stellar supporting cast is absolutely wasted. Again, I found it interesting despite it being three repetitive acts of mindless turns highlighting that the government is pure evil and they apparently keeping hiring the same set of mindless goons who race around guns blazing everywhere with little effect or competence whatsoever. Also, the camera work was AWFUL in terms of the overuse of the shaky cam."
Chasing Amy,1997,7.2,"Holden and Banky are comic book artists. Everything's going good for them until they meet Alyssa, also a comic book artist. Holden falls for her, but his hopes are crushed when he finds out she's a lesbian.","Most everyone should know the plot from reading the summary, but just in case, here's the story: Holden and Banky have been best friends for 20+ years, having known each other since grade school.  They now work together on a comic book called ""Bluntman and Chronic"", which is basically Jay and Silent Bob as superheroes (Note: It's probably best that you've seen Clerks and Mallrats beforehand, as this is the third in his interconnected Askewniverse series, which refers to characters, places, and events throughout each film and has the one constant of Jay and Bob in it.)  One night, Holden falls in love with Alyssa Jones while playing darts after a comicon.  The next night, he goes to see her and finds out she's a lesbian. However, they become friends and and he soon enough falls in love with her, and they start a relationship, much to Banky's disgust, throwing their friendship into the trash.This film not only is a great story and a meaningful message about friendship, love, and accepting the past, but an allegory for the years before he made this movie.  Notice how ""Bluntman And Chronic"" is a hit but critically slammed (in the DVD special features of deleted scenes), just like Mallrats was.  Also, Alyssa is (literally and figuratively) Joey Lauren Adams, Smith's girlfriend at the time who he broke up with over her past. Holden writes the comic in the end as an apology to her, just like Smith made the movie as an apology/Valentine to Joey.  All the characters are him on some level.This movie rocks.  Skip renting the video and buy Criterion's awesome DVD, with deleted scenes, an awesome commentary track, and much more"
Easy A,2010,7.0,"When Olive lies to her best friend about losing her virginity to one of the college boys, a girl overhears their conversation. Soon, her story spreads across the entire school like wildfire.","Just saw this with my daughter who is 13. She has just recently seen all the John Hughes 80's movies (Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club, etc.) and said it felt just like one of them. I couldn't agree more - great direction and just a hint of a wacky feel to it. Realistic, fun and interesting *normal* parents that don't take the world too seriously and want to be there for their kid.The only parts that didn't hold up was a couple of logistical things (like a girl that good looking not having any guys following her around, and having a best friend who is such a ditz). All in all though the plot stuck together, was edgy in a few ways, and thoroughly entertaining. I'd put it on the shelf right next to the John Hughes films, and that is a distinguished place indeed."
Rapunzel,2010,7.7,"The magically long-haired Rapunzel has spent her entire life in a tower, but now that a runaway thief has stumbled upon her, she is about to discover the world for the first time, and who she really is.","I am a huge Disney and animation fan, and was really interested in seeing Tangled. For me Disney have so many classics under their wing, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Bambi, Pinocchio, The Little Mermaid and Aladdin especially. For over a decade, the past Disney films ranged from very enjoyable(Emperor's New Groove) to truly disappointing(Chicken Little)- The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Tarzan were the last ones to truly blow me away- until now.While Tangled had me interested, I didn't like how the film was advertised. The trailer looked as though the film would be a Dreamworks knock-off, and I didn't think much of the title either. I needn't have worried, Tangled was wonderful and Disney's best film in a while(I know I said that about last year's Princess and the Frog, yes I actually liked that too, but after seeing Tangled I've changed my mind). The film is so much better than its advertising suggested, it is not a knock-off of Dreamworks and more importantly it not only has the Disney magic but it has something for both kids and adults.What wowed me immediately about Tangled was the animation. It is simply gorgeous. The colours look beautiful, the backgrounds are stunning especially that surrounding Rapunzel's tower and the characters are very well modelled. The real revelations are with Rapunzel's hair, which is a masterstroke and also the floating lanterns, a scene of true beauty and very touching. Alan Menken's music was a surprise and in a good way. For me, this was his best score since The Hunchback of Notre Dame(that score is amazing), I was especially taken with the Kingdom Dance.The songs are also not bad at all, they are not quite instant classics like Colours of the Wind, Beauty and the Beast, When You Wish Upon a Star, Heigh Ho, Part of Your World, Circle of Life, Hellfire, Under the Sea, Whole New World and Bells of Notre Dame are, but they are listenable with beautiful melodies and surprisingly decent lyrics. The best for me were the stunning I See the Light and the goosebump-inducing Mother Knows Best.The writing is another strong asset. Tangled has some truly excellent writing, particularly with Flynn and Rapunzel, it is funny, witty and even touching. The storytelling is polished and is snappily paced, with the action sequences lively and the ending fitting well with the rest of the movie. When I saw the trailer I was expecting a story scattered with pop-culture references and almost laughter-free dialogue, but actually the storytelling does have a classic feel to it and some scenes like the aforementioned floating lanterns give the film its magic.I also loved Tangled's characters. Rapunzel is one sassy heroine and is also someone young girls in particular can relate to. Flynn is a charming, dashing and charismatic hero too, and his interaction with Rapunzel alone gives Tangled its spark. Mother Gothel is another strong character, in her character you can see shades of both Lady Tremaine and Frollo, and on top of that she is a very intriguing villainess. Even more surprising were the comic relief characters. There have been animated films/Disney films where the comedy either works like a glove(Emperor's New Groove), is either hit or miss(I say this with a heavy heart, Hunchback of Notre Dame) or doesn't work at all(Chicken Little). Here the comedy works perfectly, hilarious without being too over-the-top. Pascal is both hilarious and cute and Maximus the horse is a sheer delight in everything he does.The voice acting also adds a lot to the film. Mandy Moore is a perfect choice for Rapunzel, she has a pleasant speaking voice and a beautiful singing voice. I loved the charisma Zachary Levi brings to Flynn, his voice is one of the main reasons why Flynn is as likable as he is, while Donna Murphy is perfect as Mother Gothel.In conclusion, this was a wonderful film and I recommend it heartily for both kids and adults. For Disney fans too, I think you will be delighted, if you want humour, adventure, beautiful animation, good music, classic storytelling, witty scripting and likable characters, Tangled is a perfect match. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
Scary Movie 3,2003,5.6,"Cindy must investigate mysterious crop circles and video tapes, and help the President in preventing an alien invasion.","I can be short about 'Scary Movie 3'. If you liked the first two films, especially the first, there is a good chance you will like this one. It is directed by David Zucker, one of the three directors of the great 'Airplane!', the film that sort of invented the genre, and it shows. Here it spoofs films such as 'The Ring', 'Signs' and 'The Matrix' and from time to time I thought it was really funny.But when I think something is funny doesn't mean anything with a film like this. 'Scary Movie 3' is a matter of taste. If you like 'The Naked Gun', 'Hot Shots' and 'Scary Movie' you like this one, if you hate them, you hate this one. The humor is silly and stupid, but in the right mood most people must be able to laugh. I know I did."
The Phantom of the Opera,2004,7.2,A young soprano becomes the obsession of a disfigured and murderous musical genius who lives beneath the Paris Op√©ra House.,"I'll add to the bazillion comments posted here: if you don't make a side-by-side comparison to the stage classic, this movie holds its own. (If you don't like the screenplay, you can blame its co-writer: one Andrew Lloyd Webber.) The famous mask here doesn't hide the fact that Butler is a lot better looking than your average Phantom, and his voice lacks the wide range required by the score---but I found it more realistic, and all told, he does reflect the emotions of a tortured soul who's lived a lifetime literally in the shadows. The movie is helped by sumptuous sets, the ALWebber score, Emmy Rossum's singing, and its tale of hopeless love. Purists may sniff, but when the movie opened people in our area went back to see it again. I did. And the dvd is a welcome addition to my collection."
Kung Fu Panda,2008,7.6,"To everyone's surprise, including his own, Po, an overweight, clumsy panda, is chosen as protector of the Valley of Peace. His suitability will soon be tested as the valley's arch-enemy is on his way.","From the very beginning, Kung Fu Panda had me practically falling out of my seat --- laughing. It was the perfect blend of comedy, heart, and action, all necessary elements in a successful and great animation/CGI film, in the tradition of The Incredibles and (less action, but containing the heart and laughter) Ratatouille, Finding Nemo and Monsters, Inc.I took my wife and nephew and niece to see it on a Friday night and they enjoyed it, too! We were totally laughing, smiling, and guffawing at Po, the main protagonist (voiced by Jack Black) and his misadventures at becoming a Kung Fu expert. This was certainly a flawed character, one that a lot of people can relate to because he dreams, he's funny, and he can laugh at himself. Also, the story was pretty clear and easy to follow because the storytelling was well crafted, and the animation was paired well with characters brought vividly to life by some of the most famous names in Hollywood.Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman are downright excellent as the main characters, and Ian McShane as the bad dude gave it the right fearful presence. Other big name stars don't shine as much, but that's because their roles are rather limited in the film. But that's still okay because the animators should be given equal credit (if not more) for delivering the funny, action and heart elements of this movie in an effective, amazing and (I've got to use this) AWESOME manner. Visually, this movie is stunning (notice all those scenic shots of the Chinese mountains, bodies of water, and the bridge scene; not to mention the action animation version of ""The Matrix"" with slow-mo)... simply a delight to watch.It's clear that Dreamworks has gotten back in the animation game with Kung Fu Panda, after slight ho-hums in Shrek 3 and Bee Movie (call me crazy, but I liked Over The Hedge more than those two). Hopefully, it should earn well over $500M worldwide because it is so good.This movie rightfully belongs in the top animation movies of all time (okay, let's not include the classic fairy tales of old; let's begin with the 90's onwards), alongside my faves ""The Incredibles"" ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Beauty & The Beast."" Has the makings of being a classic.My wife and I enjoyed it so much that we saw it again the night after. And maybe another time... haha!Enjoy!"
Conan the Barbarian,2011,5.2,A vengeful barbarian warrior sets off to get his revenge on the evil warlord who attacked his village and murdered his father when he was a boy.,"Conan lacks myth - it truly lacks that sense of myth and wonder that created a whole new genre, and it lacks cinematic vision, it lacks what makes film rather than TV, and while entertaining after a decade of Xena and Game of Thrones we deserve more than this in our big budget movies.Casting is fine, plot is a little dull, action is half-way to OK - it's just that overall there is nothing to really put life into this - where is the wow! factor, the, yes this is film. Even if you're making a B movie it doesn't excuse it.In the right hands and the right team this could be storytelling at its best, instead we get a film that thrives on the clich√© of its genre. It may have lots of sorcery, but it truly lacks magic."
King of California,2007,6.6,"An unstable dad who, after getting out of a mental institution, tries to convince his daughter that there's Spanish gold buried somewhere under suburbia.","KING OF California may not break any records for innovation of thought or script but it is a tightly made little film that allows veteran actor Michael Douglas a lollipop of a wacky role to remind us that he does have comedic talent! It also gives 20-year old Evan Rachel Wood the opportunity to compete with a Pro and come out an equal - quite a feat for such a young actress. Written and directed by Mike Cahill the story does have appeal, especially since it is set in Santa Clarita, California, a rapidly developing 'hinterland' that is suffering from the effects of too rapid industrialization, changing from a picturesque remnant of California raw beauty into yet another perky little town.Charlie (Michael Douglas) has been in and out of mental institutions for his wacky behavior. His life as a jazz bassist and entrepreneur has always veered off the map, leaving him alone with his only daughter Miranda who has survived her father's irresponsible life by keeping the old family home (in the midst of a huge housing development) with the money she makes double shifting at the local MacDonalds. When Charlie is released his focus is on discovering the gold left behind by Catholic priests in the mid 1600s, a fact he has researched while hospitalized, on the Internet, and from the journal of one of the priests. Miranda slowly buys into Charlie's madcap scheme and adventure as a gold hunter and the caper results in a bonding between father and daughter that has been teetering on the brink of disaster for years. The manner in which Charlie, Miranda, and an old ex-con friend Pepper (Willis Burks II) go after the treasure provides most of the energy of the film.Yes, there are bits and pieces of this project that have been done many times before (and often better), but the pleasure of KING OF California lies in the bravura and touching performances by Douglas and Wood. This is a pleasant excursion of a movie, worth an evening's gander. Grady Harp"
The Nutty Professor,1996,5.7,Grossly overweight yet good-hearted professor Sherman Klump takes a special chemical that turns him into the slim but obnoxious Buddy Love.,"'The Nutty Professor' is a fun, warm-hearted movie with a leading actor at the very top of his game. This is Eddie Murphy at his absolute funniest. Quite how he managed to pull off SEVEN different characters in a single film and nail every one of them I will never know.For some reason, this innocent, fun movie seems to have made a lot of people quite grumpy. 'One of the worst ever', 'fatism' and 'offensive', according to other reviews. Actually, it is quite the contrary. The message of the film is about accepting who you are. Professor Klump wants to be somebody he is not, until he realises that people actually love him as he is.I would consider 'The Nutty Professor' one of the best comedies of the 90s and an absolute masterclass from Eddie Murphy."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1,2010,7.7,"Harry Potter is tasked with the dangerous and seemingly impossible task of locating and destroying Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. Harry must rely on Ron and Hermione more than ever, but dark forces threaten to tear them apart.","Reviewers say 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1' is a film where script, direction, and acting are crucial. David Yates' direction and the main cast's performances are praised. The production quality and emotional depth are highlighted. The darker tone and mature themes are appreciated. However, pacing and editing are criticized, and the split into two films is debated. Overall, it's seen as a significant, though flawed, part of the series."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,2009,5.7,"An elite military unit comprised of special operatives known as G.I. Joe, operating out of The Pit, takes on an evil organization led by a notorious arms dealer.","G. I Joe: The Rise of Cobra is really dumb, full of bad CG and has some terrible character designs but it's still good fun that's extremely over the top and action packed. Channing Tatum gives a really good lead performance and Dennis Quaid, Sienna Miller, Marlon Wayans, Rachel Nichols and Byung-Hun Lee are all good. Stephen Sommers' direction is great, it's extremely well filmed if a little reliant on CG. It's well paced and the music by Alan Silvestri is good."
Clash of the Titans,2010,5.8,"Perseus, a demigod and the son of Zeus, battles the minions of Hades and the Underworld in order to stop them from conquering Olympus and Earth.",The Clash of the Titans remade is more like a brute version of it. It's fun but its a mess. It's more of a spectacle rather than telling a story bout the whole mythology epic with its characters though I'm seeing a lot of CGI extravaganza with over the top results which my eyes are bleeding like hell . This is one of those films where there are a lot of super good casts in a bad production.
Season of the Witch,2011,5.4,"14th-century knights transport a suspected witch to a monastery, where monks deduce that her powers could be the source of the Black Plague.","This thrilling film deals with 14th-century knights who transport a suspected witch to a monastery, where monks deduce her powers could be the source of the Black Plague which spreads death across the lands and villages , decimating life across Europa . Set during the time of the first outbreak of bubonic plague , a warrior is tasked with learning the truth about his fate as he is charged in leading a fearsome witch , as Beheman and his group of mercenaries have to go a remote location. It's an exciting story plenty of battles , action and excitement . The scenery is beautiful, and so was the cinematography . The music was great. The acting and directing was acceptable . A beleaguered church ruled by Cardinal D'Ambrosio (Christopher Lee), deeming sorcery the culprit of the plague, commands the two knights named Beheman (Nicolas Cage) and Felson (Ron Perlman) to transport an accused witch (Claire Fay) to a remote abbey, where monks will perform a ritual in hopes of ending the pestilence. A priest, a grieving knight (Ulrich Thomsen), a disgraced itinerant and a headstrong youth (Robert Sheehan) who can only dream of becoming a knight join a mission troubled by mythically hostile wilderness and fierce contention over the fate of the girl. The group must fight mysterious creatures for consuming every living thing in their path . Eventually surrounded by the frightening and ferocious foes, they must conquer his personal fears and help battle the illusive invaders who emerge out of the shroud of fog in the black of the night. When the embattled party arrives at the abbey, a horrific discovery jeopardises the knight's pledge to ensure the girl fair treatment, and pits them against an inexplicably powerful and destructive force .This sword and witchery epic movie begins with a real sense of wonder and surprise with impressive battles set in Crusades and wind up with continuous struggles against weird beings . The picture packs great loads of action , special effects abundant , horror, breathtaking combats and a little bit of gore and blood . Stunning battles scenes illuminate the full-blown adventure with a plethora of engaging action set pieces on the combats in which the heads and limbs are slice off here and there and everywhere while other parts of body are slit open . The film gets an impressive control of the crowd scenarios with a climatic and overwhelming finale battle . Exceptional and colorfully cinematography is shot on location in outdoors from Hungary , Salzsburgo , Innsbruck , Tyrol, Austria , Croatia and Shreveport , Louisiana . The camera work by Amir Mokri in this film is dangerous and thrilling . Our perspective is intimate and that lends a great deal of excitement to the movie experience . Beautiful scenery, tense and bloody battles and a claustrophobic climax in a castle lift this story . Musical score by Orvasson is evocative and spectacular . There's something for everyone here ; fans of horror, fans of action, fans of medieval adventure should all find something to enjoy about this film . It may not be the best film ever made, but its still one passable movie. The motion picture is professionally directed by Dominic Sena who has got a career full of hits as ¬®60 seconds¬® , ¬®Operation Swordfish¬® , ¬®California¬® but also some failure as ¬®Whiteout¬® .

Makes me want to ask... Right from the GITGO.... What¬®s NOT to like about this Feel-Good... Something For Everyone... Action Extravaganza!?!?!?In the '80s and '90s, Arnold Scharzennegar was the King of Hollywood action films. But nothing is forever. With the The Scorpion King, there seems to be a new pretender to the throne ...The ROCK! More charismatic and certainly a better actor (but then again, who isn't?)

A Hollywood capsule of pure adrenaline. If there is anyone in the family who does not like movies of this genre, hard not to be entertained by this minor gem. But Be forewarned!

Viva la libert√†,2013,6.9,"When a politician disappears, his (mad) twin brother is brought to replace him.","Viva la Liberta (2013)Maybe I'm programmed to like this kind of scenario: a boring politician is replaced with someone who is idealistic and fun, and who tells it like it is. The American version of this is ""Dave"" which is a hoot. Now we have an Italian version, which is more subtle and poetic. Definitely worth seeing.The genius here on screen is the actor Toni Servillo who plays both men, the senator and the slightly wacky twin brother who takes his place. It all happens so naturally, with one small twist after another. There are past loves and political foes that factor into both lives equally, to the point that you might not be sure who is who, and if there are in fact two people after all.But then, that's the magic of how this comedy is made. It is full of laughs, but it's oddly brilliant and philosophical, too. It can be appreciated on a million levels, so just let it seep into your pores."
Priest,2011,5.7,A warrior priest disobeys church law to track down a pack of vampires who have kidnapped his niece.,"A priest throwing crosses like throwing stars into a vampire caught my attention.Vampire meets post-apocalypse meets religious iconography meets Western. Staring Paul Bettany. I had the misfortune to see Legion and I've yet to forgive Mr. Bettany for participating in that wretched wince-fest. So given the actor and the genre, it's probably not going to be an Oscar-nominated type of film. But you know that the moment you saw the trailer.As a Catholic (the orthodox type that grudgingly accepts Vatican II but mutters about 'the good old days' entirely tongue-in-cheek) it caught my eye. If you happen to be Catholic, every time you see a trailer for a movie where Catholicism is notably featured, you think to yourself 'Oh boy, how are they going to do a hack job that makes it out to be nothing like it actually is this time?'. Can't blame writers though, it's a religion that provides a deep, deep mine of interesting looking iconography and concepts (Apparently Catholic priests are the Ghostbusters of any movie that involves exorcism. You know who they're going to call. An old priest and a young priest.)Interestingly enough, this film really... Doesn't involve religion. There's the iconography of Catholicism, a few words here and there, but there's really no actual religious content to the film. It's as if a tourist from another planet did a really in-depth one month tour of all things Catholic, but unable to understand the language, did the best job they could of representing it to their friends back home. The film doesn't denigrate Catholicism, it treats it more like a grab bag of 'ooo, that sounds / looks cool' material. It's a post-apocalyptic vampire western that involves characters that participate in a world where there's a State-run religion that is akin to Catholicism in a weird sort of 'parallel dimension where everyone has a goatee' type way. It's what you think you know, but not.The movie itself is visually interesting. In many ways, it's similar to Event Horizon - another film where a concept wrapped in bad dialog with little to no sane plot caught the viewer's eye with interesting imagery.Do you like vampires? Do you like westerns? Do you fancy a post-apocalyptic world? Does religion intrigue you, but in a 'not enough to be serious about it' way?This is your film. It's not a bad film. It's not a great film. If you like certain things, like I do - vampires, vampire killing in a kick-ass style and a certain visual je ne sais quoi, 'world view' that's unlike anything else out there, it's worth seeing.People you shouldn't take with you to see the film: Serious boring types that get upset if there aren't things like 'good dialog', 'character development' or 'a plot that doesn't make you put your head in your hands'. Much like Ke$ha, it's one of those catchy things you would never admit to enjoying to anyone you respected.If you happen to be Catholic, rest assured that it's not butchering the religion and presenting some horrific view of it that alienates all who would see it. That's because it doesn't understand religion, but hey (blame the material it's based on - eastern writers tend to have a really strange view of Catholicism and Christianity in general.)See it in 2D if possible. Like any 3D film originally shot in 2D, the 3D isn't great. Not as bad as Alice, but Avatar it ain't. While rated PG-13, taking anyone who isn't in college or older to see it isn't going to add anything to their life at this point.And, if you, like me, enjoy it - try not to mention that in respectable company and we can just nod at each other in passing, secure in the belief that not everything enjoyable under the sun needs to be Oscar-worthy material."
Hellboy,2004,6.9,"A demon raised from infancy after being conjured by and rescued from the Nazis, grows up to become a defender against the forces of darkness.","Hell Boy is a near classic of great proportion as played by the underrated Ron Perlman(Beauty and the Beast ) Perlman is an actor you probabley wouldn't recognize as he has had to wear so much facial make up in his career but he imbues 'Hell Boy' with a real humanity and a scathing wit .""How am I ever gonna get a girl when I drive around in a garbage truck ?

12 Years a Slave,2013,8.1,"In the antebellum United States, Solomon Northup, a free black man from upstate New York, is abducted and sold into slavery.","Reviewers say '12 Years a Slave' is a powerful film highlighting the brutal realities of slavery through the true story of Solomon Northup. Themes of resilience and systemic racial oppression are prominent. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, and Lupita Nyong'o deliver intense, realistic performances. Some criticize the graphic violence as overwhelming, while others argue the film oversimplifies slavery by focusing on one individual. Despite these criticisms, it is widely regarded as significant and impactful."
The Help,2011,8.1,"An aspiring author during the civil rights movement of the 1960s decides to write a book detailing the African American maids' point of view on the white families for which they work, and the hardships they go through on a daily basis.","Reviewers say 'The Help' evokes strong emotions, praising Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer's performances. The film is lauded for its poignant storytelling and addressing 1960s racial issues. However, some criticize its white savior narrative and sanitized depiction of racism. Emma Stone's portrayal of Skeeter receives mixed opinions, with some finding it anachronistic. The blend of comedy and drama is also debated, though the film is acknowledged for highlighting historical injustices."
Schindler's List,1993,9.0,"In German-occupied Poland during World War II, industrialist Oskar Schindler gradually becomes concerned for his Jewish workforce after witnessing their persecution by the Nazis.","Reviewers say 'Schindler's List' is acclaimed for its powerful Holocaust portrayal, highlighting human resilience and moral complexity. Strong performances by Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes, along with Steven Spielberg's direction and black-and-white cinematography, enhance its emotional and historical impact. However, some critics argue it simplifies the Holocaust, presents a clear good-evil dichotomy, and may be overly sentimental. Concerns about historical accuracy and Oskar Schindler's portrayal exist, yet it remains a significant cinematic work."
Olympus Has Fallen,2013,6.5,Secret Service agent Mike Banning finds himself trapped inside the White House in the wake of a terrorist attack and works with national security to rescue the President from his kidnappers.,"If you live long enough you'll notice something funny about the way movies are made in Hollywood. Every once in a while, particularly during summer months when studios are rolling out their blockbuster hopefuls, you'll see a couple of movies released that seem to be mirror images of one-another. Not exactly the same, but similar enough that it seems like they must have some common ancestor.The reason why this happens is pretty straight forward and has to do with the unusual way the movie industry works. Often, the scripts for movies aren't developed in-house by the studios, but rather purchased from freelance writers who come up with an idea and then ""pitch"" it to multiple studios looking for a buyer.The process works for both the writers and the studios. There is a catch, however, which is that the person pitching relies upon a studio honoring an informal agreement not to use an idea without compensating the creator. The problem is that less scrupulous studio executives will have no problem passing on an idea and then blatantly copying it for their own movie. And even though everyone involved knows what's happening, it's pretty rare for anyone to actually sue over it, so it tends to keep happening.A famous example of this (famous in the relative sense) happened with the movies 'Deep Impact' and 'Armageddon'. The original author who pitched 'Deep Impact' watched a studio exec take copious notes during the pitch, pass on it, and then rush to create a script and get his ripped off version made in time to compete with 'Deep Impact', which was purchased by another studio.This usually happens when someone creates a script that captures the zeitgeist; that taps into an idea that just clicks with what people are talking and thinking about and it becomes the ""must have"" idea of the year.Unless you're an industry insider, it can be difficult to know which movie was the original concept and which was the ripoff, but generally the original idea will be more polished and well thought out. 'Armageddon', for example, famously had such huge plot holes that the cast was complaining about them during filming.'Olympus Has Fallen' (OHF) came out around the same time as 'White House Down' (WHD). Both movies feature an attack on the white house with an invading force, aided by a turncoat secret service agent, conquering the presidential security in an attempt to take him hostage. Both movies also have a protagonist who isn't secret service, but has some connection to the agency and ultimately proves that he deserves to be guarding the president. Both movies involve protecting a child caught in the crossfire. Both have failed attempts by special forces to re-take the building. Both involve explosions that destroy the building. Both movies involve forcing a change to foreign policy. And so on, you get the idea.I don't know which was the original, but I have a guess. The movies were made during the presidency of Barack Obama. After he was elected, there was a lot of speculation about whether he would be the subject of an assassination attempt. To African Americans Obama represented an almost unbelievable event: one of their own elected to the most powerful office in the nation. And there was a great deal of angst about losing him violently, the way a number of prominent black leaders had been lost in the past. I think that was the kernel that sparked the original screenplay; this clash of the old power base and the new one in the symbolic seat of national power.To my mind, WHD was the liberal take on the idea while OHF was the conservative counter. WHD featured a charismatic black president clearly modeled after Obama, right down to his attempts to quit smoking. The villains are white supremacist types backed by the old-guard military industrial complex who are fearful of the changes the president was making to foreign policy. And the protagonist is a millennial trying to prove he was worthy of the responsibility of protecting the president, perhaps an analogy for the young political activists that brought new methods of campaigning to Obama's election.OHF, by contrast, features a white male president with villains who were almost exclusively Asian, and rather than representing the supporters of the status quo they are actively looking to tear down American force abroad, suggesting that the bad guys can't stand how effective the traditional American foreign policy is. In other words, the message is ""we are winning and they are getting desperate"". Even the protagonist is more representative of the target audience: a middle-aged man with a penchant for defiantly vowing to destroy the villains and defend our way of life.Neither movie is particularly deep; it's mostly about the action sequences. In other words, these are popcorn movies. But I do think it's interesting how two such similar base ideas can manifest such different messages. While WHD is about the (then) rising tide of the progressive political movement and the supposed fear within groups that traditionally held power in the US, OHF is all about the traditional conservative message of Jingoism and the need to protect ourselves from the parts of the world that don't share our values.Whatever the case may be, OHF was successful enough to green light a second film 'London Has Fallen', which is a continuation of the themes, only with (primarily) middle-eastern villains instead of Asian ones, and an upcoming 'Angel Has Fallen'. Personally, I thought OHF was decent but unspectacular. I enjoyed it enough when I saw it on HBO or Netflix or wherever, but I probably wouldn't pay to see it in the theater."
28 Weeks Later,2007,6.9,"Six months after the rage virus was inflicted on the population of Great Britain, the US Army helps to secure a small area of London for the survivors to repopulate and start again. But not everything goes according to plan.","Reviewers say '28 Weeks Later' features characters engaging in irrational actions for plot convenience as detrimental to the story's realism. However, some appreciate the film's intense action sequences and performances, which offer entertainment and excitement. The use of such plot devices is common in horror movies to heighten suspense and advance the narrative."
Before Sunset,2004,8.1,"Nine years after Jesse and Celine first met, they encounter each other again on the French leg of Jesse's book tour.","Reviewers say 'Before Sunset' revisits the romance of Jesse and Celine, exploring mature love and the passage of time. The film is lauded for its natural dialogue, the compelling chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, and its philosophical depth. Critics appreciate the realistic character development and emotional resonance. However, some find the pacing slow and the ending ambiguous, leading to mixed reactions. The Parisian setting and real-time narrative are noted as distinctive and captivating elements."
Calendar Girls,2003,6.9,"Best friends Chris and Annie are members of a charitable institute. When Annie's husband succumbs to leukemia, the friends decide to pose nude for a calendar to raise funds for a local hospital.","Did you know what makes the difference between ""Art and Pornography""? Well it¬¥s the artist. This was one of the stroking scenes of the film ""Calendar Girls"". This film is profundly moving and even more because it is based on a true story. The women of the W.I club somewhere in Yorkshire are famous for plum jam and speeches on different household or gardening items which are mostly quite tedious. The situation changes by the time the husband of Annie (Julie Walters)suffers from leukemia and can¬¥t get through. Annie¬¥s best friend Chris (Helen Mirren)comes up with the idea of a nude calendar with the women of the W.I. club to raise money for a settee at the leukemia ward at the local hospital. At first everybody is quite suspicious but the calendar turns out as a tremendous success which brings the girls even to Hollywood.I have rarely ever seen such a heart-warming and inspiring film. This movie makes you laugh and cry almost at the same time. (My favourite scene was the one with the oregano-joint ;-).) As most British comedies the actors were fabulous and the jokes did not seem constructed like they do in most Hollywood productions.This film is a hymn for all middle aged women. It shows the world that 40+ women can look great even when they are nude. ""The women of Yorkshire are like the flowers of Yorkshire in the last state of their lives they look best.""This film is highly recommendable for everybody even if you just want to see the beautiful landscape of Yorkshire."
One Fine Day,1996,6.5,"The lives of two strangers and their young children unexpectedly intersect on one hectic, stressful day in New York City.","A charming if forgettable romantic comedy aided immeasurably by two attractive leads. Michelle Pfeiffer is irresistable, although at this period in Clooney's career his range was precisely one character deep, and he played that same character whether that role was Batman or any other. Lately, however, he's broadened out with roles like O Brother, Where Art Thou? But he's pleasant enough in One Fine Day and clicks with Pfeiffer in a way that keeps your attention. Rather recalls Neil Simon, and if you enjoy movies like Seems Like Old Times, you'll enjoy this one.Film buffs will note a few appearances here by actors who would join Clooney later in O Brother, Where Art Thou."
Ray,2004,7.7,"The story of the life and career of the legendary rhythm and blues musician Ray Charles, from his humble beginnings in the South, where he went blind at age seven, to his meteoric rise to stardom during the 1950s and 1960s.","Given that Jamie Fox's former leading credentials not that long ago were limited to the Fox comedy series In Living Color and the atrocity of film, Booty Call, this is a truly pleasant surprise break-out performance. Jamie Fox is Ray Charles in this movie. You never question it or even think of him as Jamie Fox. It truly is uncanny. He physically looks like him, especially with the glasses, but the true magic of the performance is that he acts just like him. He walks around and performs like him, smiles like him, and just does everything like him. This is the best rendering of a real-life character in film since Jim Carrey's depiction of Andy Kaufman in Man On The Moon. However, I'd venture to say that Fox's rendering of Ray is even better. The film itself is good too, though it fails to make a smooth transition in several parts of it and lulls in some parts, while not lingering long enough in others. Of course all films of this nature that are essentially biographies to some extent tend to suffer somewhat from things of this nature. It's hard to pack 70 years into 2 1/2 hrs. Thus, the script mainly traces his early days starting out in music up into the late 60's, with a few flashbacks into his childhood and a brief jump to a single event in 1979. This is the only film I have ever seen in which the entire audience, myself included, stood up and gave a standing ovation after the last scene. It's a celebration of the life of Ray Charles that must be seen by all of his fans. The film doesn't pull any punches though. Two of the main dramatic focuses of the picture are Ray's infidelity on the road and his heroine addiction. All-in-all, a good movie, a great Oscar-worthy performance, and a good way to spend 2 1/2 hrs. This movie held my attention so well throughout its entirety that I really couldn't believe it was nearly as long as a lengthy epic like Titanic. A few quick notes: Jamie Fox spent a lot of time with Ray Charles in preparing for this role. Jamie wore prosthetics during the entire filming of the movie that made him unable to see, so if you wonder why he acts like he's blind so well, it's because he was for the movie. Also, he did all the piano playing himself, as he is practically a professionally trained pianist himself. However, for the singing, Jamie lip syncs perfectly to Charles' vocals. Overall, 8/10 movie...10/10 Jamie Fox performance."
To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday,1996,5.8,"David's wife died 2 years ago. He, his teen daughter Rachel, her cute friend and 2 in-laws trying to fix him up with a friend, are all spending the weekend at his beach house. David still ""talks to his wife"" and neglects Rachel.","David E. Kelley is a brilliant writer. The early episodes of Picket Fences & Chicago Hope, the later episodes of L.A. Law and just about every Practice & Ally McBeal ever made are examples of his great talent. The only problem he has is trying to convert that TV magic to the big screen. His movie scripts are enjoyable, but lack the energy and excitement of his great TV writing.To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday deals with a man (Peter Gallagher) who loved his wife so much, he just can't let her go. The wife's ghost seems to appear to him on the beach and he spends hours talking to her while neglecting their teenaged daughter (Claire Danes). The dead wife is Michelle Pfieffer, the best-looking ghost I've ever seen in a movie! The tension between father and daughter grows and the arrival of Gillian's sister (Kathy Baker from Picket Fences) and her husband makes things even more tense.This movie has a good cast who all give strong performances and there is a memorable scene with Claire Danes and Laurie Fortier in thong bikinis, but the movie is hurt by Kelley's weak script, which is not up to the level of quality we've come to expect from him."
Before Midnight,2013,7.9,We meet Jesse and Celine nine years on in Greece. Almost two decades have passed since their first meeting on that train bound for Vienna.,"I just saw this amazing movie at its Sundance premiere. It's wonderful on so many levels I don't know where to start. The performances are fantastic. If Julie Delpy doesn't get an Oscar nomination it would be a shame (the only stupider thing the Academy could do is have 10 best picture nominations.) Ethan Hawke's performance is brilliant in its own way, however, it's a less showy part and I'm not certain it'll get the recognition it deserves.The writing is astounding. Sharp, intelligent, biting, humorous, with staggering subtext, but most importantly--it feels real. If the screenplay doesn't get an Oscar nomination it would be a shame (the only thing stupider the Academy could do is have 15 best picture nominations.)Rick Linklater is now officially the Jedi master of indie filmmaking (Yoda Soderbergh actually said he's giving up filmmaking.) SLACKERS was only 22 years ago, and Linklater has matured into one of the most original filmic storytellers in the history of the medium. 95% of the movie is two-shots of people talking (the other 5% is people talking at a dinner table and cut aways to the gorgeous Greek landscape.) I don't know any other living filmmaker who could pull this off. There's a one-take during a car drive that lasts probably ten minutes (before a brief cut away), however, it goes on for probably another ten minutes (and Linklater said he could have kept the whole take, but needed to show ruins along the country side and cut away for script purposes, not performance.) There's a 30 minute scene of the two actors in a hotel room and I didn't even notice it (by that time I was so invested in the characters and their actions and emotions I wasn't even aware of time, it wasn't until the post screening Q&A that Linklater mentioned the actual time of the scene.)All three, Linklater, Delpy, and Hawke have matured into their rolls (writing, directing, acting) so easily that it's all just great fun for them and the audience. This is a must see for many reasons (including the history of film--there's only one other modern trilogy where the final film is the best--LOTR, and their food budget was probably more than the total cost of BEFORE MIDNIGHT.)i could go on gushing about this movie ad nauseum, however I'll finish by saying that BEFORE MIDNIGHT is what indie film making (and the Sundance Film Festival) is all about--truly original, creative, unique, interesting characters and their stories, told outside the Hollywood system, by people passionate about their craft (and in this case at the top of their craft)."
The Bounty Hunter,2010,5.6,"A bounty hunter learns that his next target is his ex-wife, a reporter working on a murder cover-up. Soon after their reunion, the always-at-odds duo find themselves on a run-for-their-lives adventure.","Just got back from the theater--walked in the door and turned on the computer--and am in agony! I was really excited about this movie and looking forward to seeing it ever since the previews came out. But, boy!, was I disappointed. All of the cute stuff (and pretty much the only cute stuff) was contained in those previews.There is nothing original, and nothing funny enough or well-acted enough to make its unoriginality interesting. Jennifer Aniston did a decent job, given what she had to work with (though she does act like she does in most of her other movies). But the writing wasn't good, and the plot was weak and all over the place. Most everything you see, you've seen before--just done better somewhere else--and all of it combined into something very hodgepodge. It's like the storywriters just took a ""pinch of this"" and a ""dash of that"" from various comedies, romances, and action adventures, and tried to make a soup out of them.The music was so bad I'm even giving it its own paragraph. I had no idea the music would make such a difference, normally I don't notice it's even there. Not so on this one! It was often agonizingly out of place, where you had to wonder what the score writers were thinking, or why they picked the song they did.I left twice for the concession stand, and didn't even care to ask what had happened while I was gone. There were times I found that I was even having to remind myself to pay attention to the dialogue. As I don't go to the theater often, it's usually a treat to me, and most of the time I enjoy whatever I'm watching simply because it's relaxing and a chance to be out. But for once I was actually bored. It was about the quality of a TV show, but unfortunately lasted the length of a full movie.The romantic/action with husband and wife fighting-yet-finding-they-might-still-love-each-other plot has been done before much better. ""Mr and Mrs Smith"" was GOOD. ""Fool's Gold"" was decent. ""Bounty Hunter"" was just downright poor. So disappointing!"
Before Sunrise,1995,8.1,"A young man and woman meet on a train in Europe, and wind up spending one evening together in Vienna. Unfortunately, both know that this will probably be their only night together.","Reviewers say 'Before Sunrise' is acclaimed for its authentic romance, deep conversations, and the compelling chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. The minimalist plot and lack of traditional conflict highlight the emotional journey and introspective dialogue. Vienna's picturesque setting enhances the romantic atmosphere, while the film's exploration of fleeting love resonates deeply. Its simplicity and unconventional structure make it a standout romantic film."
Troy,2004,7.3,"An adaptation of Homer's great epic, the film follows the assault on Troy by the united Greek forces.","Overall long,but enjoyable,don't get the hate for it,also great performance by Brad Pitt here"
The Incredibles,2004,8.0,"While trying to lead a quiet suburban life, a family of undercover superheroes are forced into action to save the world.","Reviewers say 'The Incredibles' is celebrated for its engaging action, humor, and family themes, exploring identity and teamwork. The animation, voice acting, and Brad Bird's direction receive high praise. Its sophisticated storytelling appeals to all ages, though some find the plot predictable and the runtime long. Overall, the film is lauded for its innovative superhero take and memorable characters."
This Boy's Life,1993,7.3,"The story about the relationship between a rebellious 1950s teenager and his abusive stepfather, based on the memoirs of writer and literature Professor Tobias Wolff.","This was a very haunting, sometimes very difficult story to watch unfold on screen. It was one of the first films I recollect seeing when I went berserk collecting tons of VHS tapes in the mid-90s. I had never heard of Leonardo DiCaprio, but I'm just I wasn't alone as this was his second or third time on screen. Anyway, he certainly gave a powerful performance and served notice he was going to be a ""big name"" actor.Basically, it's about teenage kid and his mom trying to survive the mean father-husband of the family in a small town during the 1950s. Robert De Niro plays the dad and Ellen Barkin, the mom. This may be the only film I've seen in which Barkin actually played the nicest person of the leads!! Leo plays ""Tobias Wolffe;"" De Niro, ""Dwight Hansen"" and Barkin, ""Caroline Hansen."" She had remarried Hansen after having ""Toby"" earlier, hence the surname ""Wolffe.""What made this story tough for me was that, to be honest, neither father nor son were nice guys, although De Niro's character was far worse. The struggles - and that's putting it tactfully - between father and son were really nasty. Yet, as unpleasant at is, the story is memorable and it haunted me for several days, especially since it is ""based"" on a true story. How much of this was true, I can't say, but it is a dramatic story you will not dismiss. However, watching dysfunctional families and hearing a lot of verbal abuse is not fun, so be warned."
Wanted,2008,6.7,"A frustrated office worker discovers that he is the son of a professional assassin, and that he shares his father's superhuman killing abilities.","I guess this is my first moment I want to comment on the movie. The reason for that is all those negative comments.People don't like the idea of a man making a giant leap across buildings, about the ""plot of the world"" and the ridicule in the movie.But at the same time I guess they DID like Trinity's jump in Matrix, destiny (sadame) in any Japanese movie or comedy of Mr and Mrs Smith.COME ON PEOPLE! This is NOT James Bond, Bourne or Die Hard. This is exactly the opposite. This movie in my opinion simply tries to make fun of all those movies. It's all a sarcastic view of today's action movies. Just like the bullets - bent to the fullest. For me it's more of an action comedy. The ideas are so stupid that it's funny. Why? Because it was fit in the action movie. I mean come on - the loom, the bullets, the healing stearine, the rats... How can you ever compare it to any action movie that tries to be serious? This is not trying to do that.That's why I liked this movie - for its intelligent sarcasm and probably because of all the negative comments from people that expected a ""mature action movie"" and didn't understand the movie."
Kung Fu Panda 2,2011,7.3,"Po and his friends fight to stop a peacock villain from conquering China with a deadly new weapon, but first the Dragon Warrior must come to terms with his past.","If I knew that I would give a sequel about a panda doing kung fu a 9 out of 10 I wouldn't believe it
But my god this is how you do a sequel. I love the first movie, but the blend of comedy, Acton, atmosphere, plot and heart gives an actual emotional experience that completely trumps its predecessor
There is no obvious flaws about this movie, it takes what 1 did good and improves it flaws to create an experience that's great for both kids and adults"
The Break-Up,2006,5.8,A couple's break-up proceeds to get uglier and nastier by the moment as each tries to keep their luxurious condo from the other.,"You all know the story. I don't think anyone would have expected it to be so loud, but the story is that one. The break up of two people who were not suppose to be together in the first place. He is that obnoxious guy offering her a hot dog. She meets him at the same time we do. I would have run as far as possible as fast as possible but apparently there was something about this slightly deranged tourist guide who likes to play video games that appealed to her. Well, so, my dear you deserve every bit you're going to get. Vince Vaughn has all the ""funny' lines and she is like a farcical woman from yesteryear, dating other guys to make him jealous. I'm not kidding, that's what she does, while he goes to visit Jon Favreau - the best bits in the film - to cry his miseries to the one other character more moronic than himself. Glimpses of Judy Davis, Ann-Margret and Vincent D'Onofrio give the movie an unexpected lift but, dear me, dear me. Rush to see the films of Preston Sturges, I'm talking to the filmmakers naturally. The awful part of the whole thing is that I found myself laughing and that as far as 2006 comedies is not half bad. Isn't that just terrible?"
The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,2011,7.2,"British retirees travel to India to take up residence in what they believe is a newly restored hotel. Less luxurious than advertised, the Marigold Hotel nevertheless slowly begins to charm in unexpected ways.","Just got back from having seen this wonderful film at a packed cinema and I'm still smiling. It really is the most entertaining, colourful and uplifting film I've seen for a very long time. Apart from India itself - which is a star in its own right - it is the performances from this stellar cast that really make this movie. At times it was like an acting masterclass, but never at any time could you see the cogs turning. The central characters were all wholly believable, and to be honest I find it impossible to single anyone out, although if I had to, my vote would probably go to Bill Nighy. He is just superb as Douglas - the apologetic, hesitant, henpecked husband of the self centred, bitter, scolding Jean portrayed by Penelope Wilton, who is also excellent. There is one particular scene between the two, where Douglas, for once bites back - and the emotion from Nighy is just mesmerising to watch. When you add the likes of Dames Maggie Smith and Judy Dench to the mix, the delicious Celia Imrie, Tom Wilkinson and Ronald Pickup (with an honourable mention to the latter, who brought a wonderfully rakish comedic performance to the mix) - and you can't go wrong.The younger cast members and all the supporting players do an excellent job - but it is the oldies who steal the show. That doesn't mean it's an oldies film - far from it. I took my 16 year old daughter and she laughed, cried and loved it as much as I did."
Terminator Salvation,2009,6.5,"As the machines prepare for a final attack, John Connor and a mysterious stranger delve into the heart of Skynet and uncover a terrible secret involving the annihilation of mankind.","I have seen a lot of reviews on here, more than I usually read. And it is way too many 1's. This movie is no where near a one rating. I've been watching a lot of movies since I was a little kid. From cheesy 80's flicks, to straight to TV. This is no where near a 1. This movie sits at a 7 for me. Would have got an 8 but I'm super hard on the female acting in these new generation of movies.This movie by now is 9 years old so nothing would be giving it away. But with that said Linda Hamilton in the first one was 19 years old. And she can act. Which is why 7 or 8 years later in Terminator 2 her acting was polished the movie was even better. It is not a secret if the female character can act you are going to have a good movie. The female acting in this movie was decent which is why it got a 7 from me.But I can see why people gave this a one. The first Terminators were scary. The machine just kept going. You also had the awesome 80's music, along with the clothes. I mean seriously Sarah O conner was riding an 80's scoter and listening to head phones. And going to the club. Just a lot of vintage stuff in that movie which brought it back to the 80's. The 90's was even better in T2, crazy hair cuts, dirt bikes and the graphics in that at the time were unique.But they did try to incorporate some of the old ideas. John Conner goes ""come with me if you want to live"", the motor cycle scene still is exciting as it was almost 30 years ago. The naked terminator. Normally during these remakes I get bored or fall asleep. It was action through the whole movie. I don't know if it was christian bale. Or who it was. But I felt entertained.If people came here looking at this review thinking they are get a play by play of the movie. I'm not doing that with this one. You have to watch and please don't listen to these negative reviews. They want to live in the past on something that has already been done.Once again don't try to watch this thinking this is going to be like the fist 2. It is not. Its just going to be great acting and simply a plot that action. Nothing over the top where its mind blowing. Expecting this movie to be like the first 1 where they were on to something new, and the second one where they had some super special effects is asking too much. It was well written movie. And its great to have all the Terminators. Cause I do."
I Am Legend,2007,7.2,"Years after a plague kills most of humanity and transforms the rest into monsters, the sole survivor in New York City struggles valiantly to find a cure.","Two thirds of this film is wonderful entertainment, both in scope and story telling, and in Will Smith we have a cracking central performance that carries the film with consummate ease, sadly the final third undoes all the great promise and tension building that had gone before it.After a genetic engineered cancer curing virus wipes out practically all of mankind, Robert Neville {Will Smith} appears to be the sole surviving human on earth, the only company he has is the family dog and an army of virus infected mutants that can only come out in the dark. That Neville is a former scientist who is immune to the deadly strain is a bonus as it means he can work on a potential cure.Yes it's daft, and yes it's contrived, but there sure is a lot of good stuff to enjoy before the films major failing surfaces. Firstly is Will Smith's performance, there is no doubting he is a major star these days, but here he also cements his standing as a bona fide A lister of note. He layers the performance so well, his character not only has to deal with the heavy threat of being killed by the mutants at night, he also has to fight his own isolation, mans inherent need for companionship is a tortured thing when you appear to be the sole beneficiary of gods green earth.Secondly the setting of a barren desolate New York is eerily staggering, overgrown with foliage and stalked by lions searching for food, it really is a big screen must to embrace the scope of it. Thirdly the mutants themselves are scary enough, but they honestly would have been better served being played by human actors rather than the CGI used that brings very mixed results, and fourthly the tension building is pitch perfect, the makers manage to have you on the edge of your seat gasping for a solution to this cracking story unfolding, but then...They throw it all away by a rushed ending that had me positively seething, a quick turn of events should be a prelude to a fully fleshed out finale but instead we get a quick wham bam, oh The End. It leaves a bitter taste in the mouth on leaving the cinema and frankly the audience deserves better, and in fact so does Will Smith, did they run out of money? Well that I don't know, but what I do know is that we so nearly had a genre classic to look fondly on for years to come, shame that. 6.5/10Footnote: Having just watched the alternate version that is readily available on disc formats, I have to say that as weak and as frustrating as the theatrical ending is, the alternate ending is far worse, trite and totally misplaced, they chose the better ending of the two for sure."
Highlander: Endgame,2000,4.6,"Immortals Connor and Duncan MacLeod must join forces against Kell, an evil immortal who has become too strong for anyone to face alone.","Overall, this was not a bad flick. It's not quite as good as the first one, but is much better than the second. I'd have given it a higher rating than I did if they'd just left out the high speed kung fu stuff - it's too much like all the cheap Bruce Li rip off movies. Anyway, the story in this one is good and it tidies up everything rather nicely at the end. They do leave one thread hanging but I don't think that was to provide the backdrop for another film. I think this one's the last Highlander film - at least I hope so. I believe that the Highlander ""thing"" has gone about as far as it can. It would be difficult to come up with anything original for another film. Again, this film isn't bad at all and nearly makes up for the poor middle of this series. The tie-in between the film McLeod and the TV McLeod was handled very well, I thought. I really liked the first film and I like this one pretty well also."
Salt,2010,6.5,A CIA agent goes on the run after a defector accuses her of being a Russian spy.,"Was it realistic? No. Did all the dots get connected? Not all. Was it fun to watch? Yes. Was it predictable? Not entirely. Lots of twists & turns. If you don't mind people sliding down a banister with six-shooters out shooting 5 hit men with Uzi's, then you'll probably like it. (This didn't really happen, and I don't really know guns but you get the message.) I thought I had it all figured out but I was oh so wrong. I would like to see it again, knowing what I know now. There wasn't a lot of cursing and relatively little blood & guts considering this type of movie. I must say, sitting next to some women who liked shouting at the screen and throwing their own punches heightened the excitement for the audience."
The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement,2004,5.9,"Now settled in Genovia, Princess Mia faces a new revelation: she is being primed for an arranged marriage to an English suitor.","The sequel is still funny and it's worth watching to hear Julie Andrews sing again. The ""mattress surfing scene is wonderful especially when the Queen (Andrews) pops in and everyone thinks OMG the party's over. But NO! Anne Hathaway is absolutely gorgeous, so guys will of course enjoy the ""eye candy"" and the ladies have some pretty hunky guys around too. The real story of this movie though is the fleshing out of the relationship between Joe (Hector Elizondo) and the Queen. That's the most interesting subplot in the story and the most enjoyable too. The ending is somewhat of a predictable surprise. I found it to be enjoyable. Not as witty as the original but still worth the watch."
Happy Gilmore,1996,7.0,"After his grandmother's house is repossessed by the IRS, a bad tempered hockey player takes his talents to golf to earn the big bucks and get his grandmothers house back.",Adam Sandler may not be the all-round actor who can deliver many different comic performances but he does have a certain comic style. Happy Gilmore is a failed Hockey player who cannot skate and has a lack of any self-discipline. His life seems to be a complete failure until he finds out he can hit a golf ball over 400 yards. At first you might feel little empathy for Happy as he obviously deserves all the bad luck he gets from the way he treats his friends. But the introduction of Shooter to the screen suddenly makes you root for the underdog. The plot is thrown together to get the most out of Sandler and his antics on screen. Some of the scenes are totally unbelievable particularly when a car is driven on to the golf course to run down Happy! But no matter how many times I see the film it can still make me laugh.
Armageddon,1998,6.7,"After discovering that an asteroid the size of Texas will impact Earth in less than a month, NASA recruits a misfit team of deep-core drillers to save the planet.","With horrible movies coming out month after month I searched for a good movie. And I found Armageddon on HBO GO and remembered that I never watched this movie in full. So many years after release, I took the time, headphones, 50 inch tv and some popcorn. Let me tell you one thing - THIS IS ONE FANTASTIC MOVIE. They don't make movies like this anymore. We give oscars to crap today, this was pure pleasure and I'm glad I never wathched it before. I always caught part of it. But today, 22 years later hehe :) man, I miss the old movie making skill."
Fast & Furious 5,2011,7.3,Dominic Toretto and his crew of street racers plan a massive heist to buy their freedom while in the sights of a powerful Brazilian drug lord and a dangerous federal agent.,"This is the film that single-handedly got me to give the rest of the series a shot, for better or worse. It's a nice change of pace from the previous films where it abandons the street race angle (how far could you have taken that anyway?) and goes into the direction of a heist action flick with cars. Dwayne Johnson is a great addition and really adds to the series embracing the goofiness of its premise. So yeah, still the best this franchise had, and that's kind of rare for a franchise on its fifth film. The action for the most part is really handled well and a lot of fun to watch. The cast as an ensemble are very charismatic which no doubt makes it more fun for audiences to see a cast that has so much diversity and it's not done with generic stereotypes but just a bunch of people with a common interest. Overall a very entertaining action flick."
Real Steel,2011,7.1,"In a near future where robot boxing is a top sport, a struggling ex-boxer feels he's found a champion in a discarded robot.","#3 on Netflix! Well deserved! I've watched this movie at least 3 times every year since it came out in 2011. Saw it pop up on Netflix & had tears in my eyes in the same parts I always do. This movie is full of heart & I will always love it. Fighters, fathers, underdogs will feel this movie to their core. ATOM!"
Moonrise Kingdom,2012,7.8,"Two 12-year-olds, who live on an island, fall in love with each other and elope into the wilderness. While people set out on a search mission, a violent storm approaching them catches their attention.","and I absolutely loved every minute. There's nothing better than when you see actors commit fully to absurdity, and there wasn't a misstep in the entire film, stellar cast and a great movie watching experience. My favorite, of Wes Anderson's films, and what a move picking the two lead child actors - their performances were brave and spot-on. I want to find this island, I want to liquidate everything I own and move there, I just wonder if a place like this still exists in the World? I bet it does. Quirky and humorous, this film doesn't disappoint (or at least I've only heard of 1 person so far not giving it a thumbs up), anyone who doesn't get this film I suspect had a very regimented childhood and didn't take any risks. Great soundtrack, two people near me in the theatre jumped up into the aisle to start dancing (I suspect they may have been there for a second viewing!), the entire audience enjoyed it. Really, Anderson's best film yet in my book, highly recommended."
Gravity,2013,7.7,"Dr Ryan Stone, an engineer on her first space mission, and Matt Kowalski, an astronaut on his final expedition, have to survive in space after they are hit by debris while spacewalking.","To me, 'Gravity' may not quite the masterpiece that it has been touted to be, though the critics and positive reviews do a fantastic job summing up the film's merits. However, while it is easy to see why some won't like it it is nowhere near as bad from personal opinion as the negative reviewers say. It is nowhere near the worst film ever and not deserving of a 1/10 rating with the visuals, effects and direction being such an achievement, the trend to bash critics and those who agree with the general consensus has also become extremely annoying.Alfonso Cuaron is is an extremely talented director, all his films to date have proved that. 'Children of Men' is especially good and one of the best films of the decade, have always have had a huge soft spot for 'A Little Princess', 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' is not for everyone but for me it was a near-masterpiece, 'Prisoner of Azkaban' is one of the best directed films of the 'Harry Potter' franchise and as polarising as 'Gravity' is there is no denying that Cuaron's direction and the visuals were exceptional. 'Gravity' may be my second least favourite film of his, with 'Prisoner of Azaban', still very good, faring least, this is saying little and is testament to Cuaron's talent.'Gravity' does fall short of perfection. Its weak spot is the script, it does tend to ramble, feel manufactured and cheesy and doesn't do an awful lot to make the characters more than mere clich√©s. The story doesn't always grip with a few slow, dull spots, and the ending puzzles.However, as said already in this review and by previous reviews (acknowledged in most less than positive postings, 'Gravity' is a triumph visually and technically. The cinematography is tremendous, quite possibly the most beautiful and best shot film of 2013. The setting is striking and the special effects are a marvel. Cuaron's direction is exceptional, some of the best he has ever done, a master of visuals and mood.With that being said, 'Gravity' has much more to it than the visuals and direction. The music is an incredible fit, it's haunting, sweeping and breathtakingly beautiful. A good deal of the story is gripping, with intimacy, tension and great emotional impact.Sandra Bullock gives one of her finest performances here and gives the film a certain grace, while George Clooney has a cool calmness that fits his role perfectly. Ed Harris is also impressive.Overall, an achievement visually, technically and directorially, but despite its faults 'Gravity' is much more than those things. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,2008,7.8,"Benjamin Button, born in 1918 with the physical state of an elderly man, ages in reverse. He experiences love and break-ups, ecstasy and sorrow, and timelessness by the time he dies in 2003 as a baby.","Possibly the most anticipated winter film of 2008, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a curious film indeed. It's got an intriguing and completely absorbing story, as well as my favorite director, David Fincher, on the top of his game. With ""Button"", Fincher cements his place as one of the best directors alive, as his film is nothing short of magical, mesmerizing, riveting, ground breaking, and ultimately, timeless.When I first heard about this movie, I had to wonder...how was Fincher, the guy responsible for realistic, gripping, crime thrillers like Seven and Zodiac going to pull off the fantasy film of a lifetime? Armed with a massive budget, Fincher uses everything a director can use to craft the most charming and technically brilliant film of the year. It's a film to be cherished for ages.""Button"" has struck me like this because a recurring theme in the film is that age is only a number, and that we as people can choose what we do with our lives, no matter what our age is. What better way to tell this message than through a story where the titular character ages backwards, and must experience life in such a way? How does one fall in love when he could one day appear young enough to be his spouse's child? How does a 5 year old play with the neighborhood children when he's confined to a wheelchair stricken with old age? Fincher's epic explores our choices, lives, and the timelessness of life itself.Brad Pitt plays the title role of Benjamin Button with a certain air of likability like he always does. While I felt he did a good job with the part, he didn't have to do much...Benjamin, fittingly, is a rather quiet character (I'd be willing to bet he narrates more than he actually talks in the film). In terms of acting, the film belongs to the ladies, Cate Blanchett and Taraji P. Henson in particular. Though Blanchett may seem overrated to some, there's no denying her unrivaled talent at playing a character as complex and deep as Daisy, and she pulls it off with ease and charisma. Taraji P. Henson will warm your heart as Benjamin's mother, as she's humorous, warm, and loving, so loving that I felt as if she was my mother.The main complexity behind the film, especially with a director like David Fincher, is keeping the film grounded in reality, while maintaining the undeniable magic within. As a director, you don't want to lose too much of either quality, instead keeping a healthy balance of the two. I feel that Fincher accomplished this perfectly. He is mainly helped out by a magical score, and absolutely stunning cinematography (which immediately identified it as a Fincher film, because of the darkness and lighting of it).Despite the wonder and awe of the film, mixed with the realism that Fincher always brings, the true allure of the film is not just Benjamin's aging problem, but the romance between Benjamin and Daisy, which is beautiful. Two people in love, regardless of age, time, or place. It's one of the most compelling romances of the year.""Button"" is also the most technically well made movie of 2008, as the true standouts are the Visual Effects and the Makeup, both of which are Oscar worthy. Pitt plays the character at almost every age, but it's almost impossible to tell when the CGI is being used on him. You know it's there, obviously, but you can't tell it's being used. When the transition is just smooth enough for the Visual Effects to be retired, but just rough enough to use makeup, it's absolutely perfect. If you've ever wanted to see Brad Pitt look 20 again, look no further, as the effects that make our actors young again (the same goes for Blanchett) are just as stunning as those that make them older.Despite a long runtime, the film never drags. If I had to point out one thing I would've liked to have seen a little more of, it would've been more of Benjamin as a little kid, as I felt that was rushed (for those who don't know what I mean, I mean the last parts of the film when he's old, but his body is young). This doesn't hurt the film in any way, as it's just my wishful thinking.I know I've used the word 'magical' a lot in this review, and don't think it's on accident. If I could pick one word to describe David Fincher's masterpiece, that would be it: magical. ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is a captivating piece of art that shouldn't be missed by anyone."
127 Hours,2010,7.5,"A mountain climber becomes trapped under a boulder while canyoneering alone near Moab, Utah and resorts to desperate measures in order to survive.","As demonstrated by his ability to earn acclaim in everything from zombie films (""28 Days Later"") to foreign coming-of-age love stories (""Slumdog Millionaire""), Danny Boyle has an extraordinary gift as a filmmaker and in ""127 Hours,"" he channels it into an extraordinary story of human willpower. This could have easily been a compelling but plain and ordinary documentary on the Discovery Channel or National Geographic about a man pinned under a boulder who miraculously survives. Boyle, however, transforms it into a powerful statement about the will to live and where that motivation truly comes from.""127 Hours"" does not simply prove the point that humans will do whatever it takes to survive in dire circumstances. In fact, I might argue 9 of 10 people wouldn't do what Aron Ralston (James Franco) does in this film. Anyway, Boyle makes it his mission to use Ralston's incredible true story -- one that told at face value would probably just elicit gasps -- to alter our perspective on living.What's obvious is that none of the impact of ""127 Hours"" is possible without Franco. A film about a man trapped in a crevice for more than five days needs a heck of a lead actor and Franco, despite few dramatic credits to this point, proves beyond capable. Although boredom might set in for some during this film given its plot, the believability of Franco's performance remains constant and irrefutable. He possesses the fun-loving and care-free charisma of Ralston then slowly breaks that shell and shows his human fragility.Yet remarkably, Boyle leaves a substantial thumbprint on the film, much of which he shares with co-writer Simon Beaufoy, also of ""Slumdog."" Because the story is so straightforward, Boyle recognizes imagery and perception provide his only means of creativity. He shows us inside the tube of Ralston's water backpack, water bottle and other close-ups, all of which seem unnecessary, but they establish images which we will come to think about with a different perspective as the film wears on, such as when Aron drinks his own settled urine out of the water pouch. Boyle uses the same process shot, but suddenly we don't see it the way we did earlier and they become more meaningful than tedious.This subtly effective technique can also be found in the beginning and ending shots of the film. It seems completely random that Boyle would open with crowded streets of people as if he's tricked us and really made ""Slumdog 2,"" but the image gains significance after experiencing Ralston's journey.""127 Hours"" will not be kind to people who don't take lightly to seeing blood outside of the ""shoot 'em up"" genre. Many of these people will leave the film thinking all they got was shock value, but of course there's much more to it. Despite the ""how will he survive?"" plot, a substantial amount of time is placed on flashes to memories Aron thinks of regarding his family, fantasies and of course, regrets. Boyle beautifully shows us that although survival seems an inherently selfish thing, much of that motivation and will to live comes from other people, even total strangers. Aron thinks a lot of the girls (Kata Mara and Amber Tamblyn) he hiked with just hours before the accident though otherwise he'd have likely forgotten them.The build-up and catharsis of Aron's story might not be the most powerful and uplifting based-on-true-story you've witnessed, but ""127 Hours"" clearly surpasses expectation in terms of the message it sends and the impact it leaves. With it, Boyle solidifies his place as one of those filmmakers you must always have an eye on and Franco emerges as a relatable everyman with above-everyman-grade talent.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com"
Old Boy,2003,8.3,"After being kidnapped and imprisoned for fifteen years, Oh Dae-Su is released, only to find that he must track down his captor in five days.","Reviewers say 'Oldboy' is celebrated for its intricate plot, shocking twists, and emotional impact. Many praise its cinematography, direction, and Choi Min-sik's compelling performance. However, some critics argue the violence is gratuitous and the twist unconvincing, leading to mixed reactions. Despite the controversy, 'Oldboy' is often hailed for its bold storytelling and significant place in modern cinema."
Oldboy,2013,5.8,"Obsessed with vengeance, a man sets out to find out why he was kidnapped and locked into solitary confinement for twenty years without reason.","A washed up alcoholic is kidnapped and imprisoned in a single room by his unseen captors for 20 years. After finding that he has been framed for murder he sets out for revenge and vindication. And while bettering himself in the process he aims to find out why he endured his confinement.A solid remake of the great South Korean film based on the Japanese Manga 'Oldboy' by Nobuaki Minegishi and Garon Tsuchiya. With plenty of homage's to Chan-wook Park's 2003 original Spike Lee adaptation makes some minor changes to the story some are for the better including a more fitting closing. Pacing however does feel choppy/rushed in places possibly due to studios heavy editing intervention.Lee's offering is wonderfully filmed and acted, Samuel L. Jackson leaves an impression but Josh Brolin excels and clearly was 100 percent dedicated to the role, surprisingly executing the action scenes with surreptitiousness. The casual viewer may not find the dark humour, peculiar characters or reveal palatable. Nevertheless it equals or debatably surpasses the likes of Sixth Sense, Angel Heart, The Usual Suspects to name a few with its surprise ending. Ultimately, those who want a gritty psychological thriller with a spot of action and a fantastic twist look no further.Possibly curious viewing for fans of Park's original but a compelling must see for viewers not familiar with the story."
Sphere,1998,6.1,A spaceship is discovered under three hundred years' worth of coral growth at the bottom of the ocean.,"The Sphere (1998)Barry Levinson is one of those directors who has no interest in art, or in invention, or in pretension, either. And so his films sometimes hit a popular strain that makes them take off. He has some terrible misfires, for sure, but his best films (""Rain Man,"" ""Sleepers"") have people who you relate to, and who have to confront something extraordinary.That was the idea here, based on a Michael Crichton novel (that should have been a heads up). The cast is headliner stuff. Dustin Hoffman is particularly convincing, Samuel Jackson plays a great type, and Liev Schreiber is sharp. Sharon Stone is a dull fourth. They bond, and realize they have things in common, in the first minutes of the film as they converge and go under water to check out an alien spaceship. Even after they are deep below the surface and beginning their unlikely exploration they make a viewer connect. As much as it borrows from ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" this could have been a good film on its own terms. Even the talking computer/alien has its own edge compared to HAL.What goes wrong is the plot itself, and not acting, or even directing, can overcome that. As it gets hairier, we need it to be more plausible, not less. Events get increasingly chaotic, so that action and loud noise drive some of the scenes. Subplots are continued but seem increasingly meaningless (at one point, Hoffman and Stone are rushing into the water in an absolute emergency and they start to chitchat about their distant failed love affair). And finally, as people die off and the menace becomes more ambiguous, the movie becomes completely ambiguous, and as a kind of escape valve, announces that any number of crazy thing we have been watching may or may not have been imagined by one character or another.But what does that mean about the camera? Isn't there still a differentiation between cinema reality and one character's delusion? Or if these are global delusions including the viewer, shouldn't they do more than simply disorient us? Well, don't hang on for answers. Just hang on. An explosion (of course) caps it all off (why they didn't hit the disarm button isn't explained), and a final logical wrap up that avoids the time travel paradox is warm and fuzzy."
Sunshine,2007,7.2,A team of international astronauts is sent on a dangerous mission to reignite the dying Sun with a nuclear fission bomb in 2057.,"I'm not going to drop any spoilers here. I will simply say that for the first hour this movie is superb, with an excellent cast, a beautiful orchestral score, and a solid script based on a wonderfully grandiose Big Sci-Fi Idea.However, an hour in things begin to degrade, with a couple of poor plot decisions that could have been forgiven if they had just moved on. But an hour and 16 minutes in they double down on one particularly bad plot choice, and the film degenerates into horror movie cliches (yes, horror) which simply have no place here and ruined what would have been and unusually sublime and moving science fiction drama. I would love to know what in the world they were thinking, allowing the script to devolve and go in a direction that does not do justice to all of the other labor and excellent creative decisions that went into other aspects of the movie. What a shame."
Dark City,1998,7.6,"A man struggles with memories of his past, which include a wife he cannot remember and a nightmarish world no one else ever seems to wake up from.","John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up in an eerie hotel, naked and in the bathtub, with no memories and blood on his forehead. (I couldn't imagine a more strange and frightening experience.) The ring of the hotel phone breaks the silence-- a strange man on the other end tells him he must leave because there are people looking for him. Many events such as this one unfold in Dark City, where ""man has no past... and humanity has no future"".Dark City has been passed over by so many critics it's depressing. I think that it should at least have been up for ""original screenplay"" or SOMETHING at the Oscars to reward Alex Proyas for his fantastic vision. I fail to see why so many people label this movie ""noir"" like it's BAD or something. Being dark and twisted is not a crime, and despite some other people's comments, this movie is NOT just for the trenchcoat-wearing masses (or if it is, maybe the rest of you can learn something from Goths). If you like sci-fi, dark plots and having reality be so well distorted that you don't realize it IS, so you will love Dark City. (People who have seen the Matrix BEFORE this movie MUST see it, it is very similar in these three respects).I gave it a 9 out of 10 ONLY because I thought the ending fight scene was a bit weak. Great for a fight scene, but because the rest of the movie focuses on John Murdoch's quest to discover his past and the eerie, ominous happenings in the city, the climax seemed hastily thrown together, as if the crew all of a sudden remembered they had a deadline to meet and could no longer continue the plot in the previous fashion.The visuals in this movie were absolutely stunning. The effects were NOT used to substitute for the plot, like other movies such as Starship Troopers, Lost in Space and Alien: Resurrection. They were used only as needed and were breathtaking. The editing is NOT as choppy as is rumored, it only lends to the power of the movie. There are some heart-stopping images in Dark City. Watch for the Strangers' clock, views of the city and John's memories.Proyas takes ideas and ambience from many other movies but integrates them all neatly into Dark City. Gotham City is clearly seen as is Metropolis and other influences such as Ed Hopper's ""Nighthawks"" dominate in the diner scenes. The forty-ish era (yet strangely futuristic) city is known to be populated, and yet it is ominously empty (hence one of Hopper's main themes, isolation in large cities). (It's especially quiet at midnight, hehehehe... ;D ) This 40's era ambience together with the sci-fi fantasy undercurrent makes for a very interesting feeling while watching.I'm happy that Kiefer Sutherland, Richard O'Brien (of Rocky Horror fame) and William Hurt agreed to do this movie, it gave Dark City just that much more validation in the USA (I wish things weren't like this, but they are). Kiefer Sutherland is absolutely wonderful and convincing as the doctor/scientist Dr.Schreber, and Rufus Sewell is a properly confused yet determined John Murdoch. Many critics say that William Hurt's character, the detective, and Jennifer Connelly's Emma Murdoch could have used a little more development, but I think part of the point of Dark City was that you don't really know who people are (not to mention yourself). Richard O'Brien and his character's whole race creep me out every time I see the movie, but he's especially frightening and a strange character. I had to resist the urge to talk like a Stranger after seeing the movie a few times.Trevor Jones, one of my favorite movie composers, did the score for Dark City, and I must say it's very apropo. The deep, bass vocals and frantic themes are some of my favorite aspects, but ""Memories of Shell Beach"" is a haunting, beautiful song as well. Some of my other favorite scores by him are the Dark Crystal and Last of the Mohicans.Altogether, I think Alex Proyas had a stroke of genius in the making of this movie. One of the most original dark sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time. It deserves its place with the Matrix, 12 Monkeys and others, pioneers in a field so changed (usually for the worse) since Star Wars and since earlier sci-fi classics. I hope these won't be the last of a (dare I say it?) dying race of movies that have true creativity and originality."
The Brothers Grimm,2005,5.9,Will and Jake Grimm are traveling con-artists who encounter a genuine fairy-tale curse which requires true courage instead of their usual bogus exorcisms.,"Are you familiar with the Grimm fairy tales? Did you like the way ""Shakespeare in Love"" explained how Shakespeare might have gotten his ideas for ""Romeo and Juliet?"" Did you like ""Shrek?"" Are you a fan of Matt Damon or Heath Ledger? Do you think Monica Bellucci is hot? If your answer to any of the above questions is ""yes,"" and you are willing to suspend disbelief (because boy is this movie inconsistent if you actually think about it) this film will provide an entertaining diversion. It's funny, interesting, exciting, and even a little scary (so don't bring your little children if they get scared easily).The premise - Matt Damon and Heath Ledger are the Brothers Grimm, famous around French-occupied Germany for driving away demons, though they are, in fact, con artists with fancy gadgets and conspirators for special effects. They use the money they collect for their ""services"" to finance their operations. The French occupying government catches them and sentences them to death, unless they out-con the conman who is causing little girls to disappear in a town alongside the woods. In this town and the neighboring woods are the inspirations for numerous Grimm fairy tales, including Hansel & Gretel, Rapunzel, and Little Red Riding Hood.The characters aren't the most deep of film characters, but they are developed enough to be distinctive and convincing. Will Grimm (Matt Damon) is the brains behind the team, with a very realistic desire to protect his brother, even as he harbors a constant anger at him for blowing the only opportunity to save their little sister's life when they were children. Jake (Heath Ledger) is the dreamer, convinced that there is truth in legend, and that with courage and effort, any problem can be solved. Predictably but not boringly, the two of them provide the perfect team to fight what turns out to be a real-life, magical, evil danger.The special effects aren't the best; some of the cgi creatures move quite jerkily, but when they're good, they work. The sets are beautiful, and fit the Grimm fairy tale world well. The costumes are likewise gorgeous and apt.If you think about this film enough to ask questions like, ""if evil magic was real, how come the brothers are famous instead of having been discredited the first time they pretended to fight off a real evil presence and it continued to haunt people?"" then you will be disappointed. However, if you are willing to suspend disbelief, you'll be in for an entertaining summer popcorn treat."
Casanova,2005,6.5,"The fabled romantic Giacomo Casanova, after failing to win the affection of the Venetian woman Francesca Bruni, strives to discover the real meaning of love.","This movie is a blast. If you're a fan of Shakespearian situational comedy (Twelfth Night, Midsummer Night's Dream, etc) then you're in for a treat. And please note that when I refer to Shakespeare, I'm talking about the original plays, not some stupid Kenneth Brannaugh romp.The plot weaves a wonderfully tangled web of lies, misunderstandings and mistaken identities. The characters are just plain fun to watch. And director Lasse Hallstr√∂m pulls off what so few people are able to do: make a comedy that doesn't offend anyone. Well, actually I think some Catholics may be offended at the uncomplimentary portrayal of the 18th century papacy, but from what I know of history, it's well deserved.But this leads me to another point. Don't expect history, OK? A few reviewers seem to be upset by the poetic license Hallstr√∂m takes. C'mon people, it's a fantasy. It's no different from the film AMADEUS which trounces all over historical fact but gives us a fantastic dramatic fiction in return. I admire creative writers who can turn history on its ear.So yes, this isn't the erotic, decadent Casanova you may be expecting. In my opinion, that portrayal is hackneyed anyway. This is a much fresher approach. So put down your history books and enjoy the picture already."
10 Things I Hate About You,1999,7.4,"A high-school boy, Cameron, cannot date Bianca until her anti-social older sister, Kat, has a boyfriend. So, Cameron pays a mysterious boy, Patrick, to charm Kat.","One thing about the Bard -- he knew the plots that touches everyone's lives, no matter where on the social strata or when in history they may be. It is made apparent in the case of Cameron James, new kid in school, as he falls for the lovely Bianca, who cannot date until her older shrewish sister Kat will date. But Kat doesn't WANT to date, and thus Cameron must scheme to find a suitable guy for this harpy-with-the-heart-of-gold if he is to win the fair Bianca.Julia Stiles may be no Elizabeth Taylor, but then, she doesn't have to be. This flick relays the same message to a brand-new audience and is fun and entertaining to boot (plus I don't think Taylor could dance on a table quite like Stiles does in one of the more memorable scenes.)In the end, this is a charming movie that will entertain and educate high-schoolers as well as those several years past graduating. After all, Shakespeare knew what he was writing about -- there is no age limit when it comes to matters of the heart!"
Frankie & Johnny,1991,6.8,"Johnny has just been released from prison, and gets a job in a caf√© beside waitress Frankie. Frankie is a bit of a loner, but Johnny is determined their romance will blossom.","This is one of the best romantic movies I have ever seen. It is not one of those movies that shows love in a fantasy world where there are no rules, this is real love in the real world. Michelle Pfeiffer gives one of her best performances on screen. this movie is not only about a cook who falls for a waitress, but it is about the fears and hesitations we all have in starting a new life. The director did a great job in setting the right environment for the movie, which gave it a real realistic touch. Al Pacino gave a good performance, but Michelle Pfeiffer was perfection. There is a line in the movie that says it all , when Pfeiffer and Al Pacino are in the same room, he says : ""everything I want is in this room"". Don't miss seeing real love in the real world. Don't miss seeing ""Frankie and Johnny""."
Monty Python's the Meaning of Life,1983,7.5,The comedy team takes a look at life in all of its stages in their own uniquely silly way.,"The moment you start watching ""Monty Python's Meaning of Life"", and you see the unexpected movie within the movie ""The Crimson Permanent Assurance"", in which an office building turns into a pirate ship, you know you're in for one hell of a surreal ride. ""Meaning of Life"" is the Pythons at the zenith of their lunacy, filled with shocking moments of violence, offensive behavior, repulsive bodily functions, and all sorts of jaw-dropping bric a brac. Whether or not the movie truly intends to make us ponder the meaning of life or not is debatable, but you have a great time watching it. With an aquarium full of fish as a sort of Greek chorus, we explore the 3 stages of life: birth, growth, and death. The faint of heart better beware: ""Meaning of Life"" has scenes that would, even today, barely fly in the land of the Puritans. Michael Palin, as a dirt-poor father of 100 children, leads an epic musical number against birth control. Eric Idle, while singing about the vastness of the universe, witnesses a constellation take form of a naked woman giving birth. John Cleese plays a headmaster who teaches sex ed by having intercourse with his wife in front of his class (it's easily the least erotic sex scene in cinema history). And, in ""Meaning of Life""'s most famous scene, the revolting, gluttonous Mr. Creosote (Terry Jones) literally eats until he explodes. The film lampoons several touchy topics: Catholic dogma, basic human stupidity and selfishness, the foolishness of war (in a brilliant parody of ""Zulu"", with Michael Caine in a brief cameo), and even death itself (one man is able to choose his death, in which he is chased off a cliff by a mob of topless women). Yet it's not entirely gratuitous. In fact, the Pythons make several good points: birth control shouldn't be denied to anyone, especially those too poor to have children. Gluttony is wrong, and will in time punish you itself. We only live once, so we better enjoy the ride. It's no-holds-barred madness, and it's Monty Python at their best. ""Meaning of Life"" doesn't have the same cult following as ""Holy Grail"", but it's certainly one of their best. If you can't handle gore, sex, vomiting, or lunacy, steer clear. For those willing to take the chance, check out ""Monty Python's Meaning of Life"" and maybe we'll figure out, as the title song says, if ""mankind's evolving, or is it too late?""."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,2003,5.5,Lara Croft sets out on a quest to prevent Pandora's box from landing into the wrong hands.,"When an earthquake in Santorini, Greece uncovers the lost Luna Temple of Alexander the Great, wealthy globetrotting treasure hunter Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) jumps at the chance to unearth the secrets of this lost temple and uncovers a strange glowing orb. However when Lara and her associates are ambushed by the Chinese crime syndicate, Shay Ling, the orb is lost with Lara now only possessing partial images of the orb. Lara is later contacted by MI6 who inform her the orb is of interest to biological research magnate Dr. Jonathan Reiss (Ciar√°n Hinds) who on the surface is a respected doctor whose efforts in medical research have earned him the Nobel Prize, but beneath that fa√ßade is the leading creator of biological weapons who sells his weapons to anyone for the right price. MI6 says Reiss is trying to find Pandora's Box in the elusive Cradle of Life, where humanity is said to have originated from, with intent to use the Box as a weapon. Lara agrees to pursue the orb and Reiss and requests Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), a former soldier turned mercenary who possesses knowledge of the Shay Ling and is an old flame of Lara's. Now Lara and Terry must travel the globe from Mainland China, to Hong Kong, to Africa to prevent devastation to humanity.Following the smash success of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider in 2001, development began on a sequel with the film financed as an international co-production through tax credits and presales similar to how the first film was done in a manner that profits were generated before the movie hit theaters. The movie underwhelmed in its debut opening in 4th place behind holdovers Pirates of the Caribbean and Bad Boys II in 2nd and 3rd place respectively, while the top spot was seized by Robert Rodriguez' Spy Kids 3D: Game Over. While the film petered out stateside with a final tally of about $65 million, well short of the $130 million produced by its predecessor, international numbers did bring its final tally to $160 million worldwide which while not great was still profitable thanks to the offsetting of financial risk with presales and tax credits. Paramount blamed the underperformance on the failure of Eidos' then latest release in the game series with Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness garnering bad reviews and souring the brand (which would lead to a soft reboot with Tomb Raider: Legend). While Angel of Darkness' poor reception from fans and critics probably didn't help, Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life feels like it's somewhat lacking in the energy and drive that was present in the previous film.In many ways The Cradle of Life does improve on the previous entry with elements like Lara Croft's killer training robot or the dodgy CGI elements seen in the first film dialed back by a considerable degree. The opening action beat where Lara finds the Luna Temple is really good with some nice acrobatic work for Lara in initially obtaining the Orb that starts off the adventure in a nice visual reference to sequences seen in the games and once again Jolie is doing a nice job inhabiting the character. There's also a fun dynamic between Jolie's Lara and Gerard Butler's Terry with the two sporting a fun sexually charged dynamic and the two playing off against each other quite well. Terry feels like an expansion of what was only hinted at with Daniel Craig's Alex West character from the previous film and as a result is given much more presence and purpose in comparison. Unfortunately the same can't be said for the film's primary antagonist, Ciar√°n Hinds playing Johnathan Reiss who's just boring as a villain and wants to use Pandora's Box because ""wouldn't the world be better with fewer people?"". At least the last villain from the previous movie wanted world domination, here, our villain wants to destroy the world because ""meh, what else am I gonna do?""Another part that doesn't work as well is with the film's visual identity or creativity of its adventure sequences. While Jan de Bont has given us some entertaining films as a director and cinematographer with his work photographing Basic Instinct and Die Hard showing his eye for such material as well as his entertaining if silly directorial efforts on films like Speed and Twister, De Bont feels a little more restrained here with a lot of scenes not really matching the level of distinction we saw in the last film. The first movie was objectively speaking a sillier film, it also had a stronger sense of visual identity with two major Tomb Raiding sequences set in Cambodia and Siberia with the tombs both having unique designs as ""puzzles"" and action beats, as well as distinguished environments that were well established. The cradle of life on the other hand only has ONE major Tomb Raiding sequence at the beginning of the movie and for the rest of the film with its heavy emphasis on Chinese crime syndicates and corrupt pharmaceutical magnates doubling as biological weapons dealers, it hit me that the movie is going less for Indiana Jones and instead more for James Bond. The Cradle of Life is for the most part feels like it's more in line with a spy thriller than an adventure film, down to the fact Lara is working with MI6 as well as a former mercenary who's a love interest. The movie also has a predominantly orange color palette which just doesn't feel all that appealing and leaves the film lacking much visual identity. The movie does eventually return to adventure aspects with a third act set on Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa, but the sequence substitutes the orange color palette for a dark grey color palette and takes a promising idea of a room with no set direction of up and down and does virtually nothing with it leading to an underwhelming climax.Lara Croft: Tomb Raider-The Cradle of Life feels just so lifeless. While Jolie and Butler are engaging leads, the adventure they go on in the movie is lacking in adventure and feels more like a generic spy movie that occasionally puts in lip service to adventure. It's not a terrible movie as there are occasionally some standout action sequences or moments with the cast that do work, but there's really not much here that wasn't done with more fun and drive in the last movie."
Iron Man 2,2010,6.9,"With the world now aware of his identity as Iron Man, Tony Stark must contend with both his declining health and a vengeful mad man with ties to his father's legacy.","Reviewers say 'Iron Man 2' offers mixed reactions. Robert Downey Jr.'s performance is lauded for charisma and humor. Action scenes, especially the Monaco Grand Prix and final battle, are praised for excitement and effects. Criticisms include a cluttered plot, pacing issues, and lack of focus. Some feel it sets up future Marvel movies at the expense of a cohesive story. Villains, like Ivan Vanko, are seen as less compelling. Despite flaws, many find it entertaining and a valuable MCU addition."
300,2006,7.6,"In the ancient battle of Thermopylae, King Leonidas and 300 Spartans fight against Xerxes and his massive Persian army.","The title refers to ""the good friend"" character who gives a memorial speech at the end, presenting the legacy that grows to fantastic proportions on its way to us as narrator whose words are from another planet. Presumably you as a viewer will make the association I did the with the demigods of Olympus, so artificial and childlike are the notions this narrator presents. They are so simple and extreme, these notions of how the world is abstracted through one eye..It allows us to take a very few indicators and suppose a world. Deliberate deprivation of young boys is supposed to somehow instill valor. Flying blood droplets is supposed to somehow validate combat expertise. Tactical stubbornness leading to defeat is somehow celebrated, I suppose, coming very close to the 72 virgins bit. Yes, indeed, sometimes this slipped for me into the opposite of what it was intended to purify. The elixir of admiration for the west snapped to Zoroastrian soma more often than not.That's because the history is that the Persians (the Achaemenids were actually Medes, more like Afghans are today) were the great world-builders of the era, creating less a totalitarian state than a federation of free states that flourished by trade not terror. And the Spartans were the thugs, the warlords who oppressed and terrorized their neighbors, building a state based on pillaged wealth. Even the Nazi association is reversed, the Medes were the Aryans, the Spartans essentially African, and no longer extant in today's Greece.(Later, the Alexandran Macedonians, the Greeks of today, destroyed the by then corrupt and fragile Persian empire and all its great libraries and histories, torturing the collected scientists to death, in what has to have been the greatest and most brutal setbacks of civilization ever.)So the resonances with today keep oscillating in a strange and stimulating dance between the intended admiration of these thugs we are meant to feel as the west, and those of Islam. But that ""struggle"" is over issues as remote from this as swimsuits are from locomotives. Let's even say vinyl padded speedos.As a movie, the thing is oddly uneven. It's tied together by a consistent score, mixed of heavy metal and aeolian voices. And it does have a story, actually two; though simple, they span the thing and stitch pieces together. But there are distinct visual styles here, too many to integrate. I felt actually as if I were defending myself from some of them as they came at me just as the different components of the Persian army attacked the 300 hooting bodybuilders.Its inevitable I suppose, when the computer work is so massive it has to be parsed out to creative teams distributed all over the world, and they have nothing better to go on than a comic book. I will admit that some of the these teams gave me great satisfaction, some of them in the actual battle scenes where the speed-shifts worked to emphasize the mapping of comic panels into reality. This, if you follow such things, was developed by Peter Weir in ""Gallipoli,"" starring a then new Mel Gibson. Mel then sorta borrowed them for his own battle epic, including the early scene where he lops off a head. Here we emphasize the flying bodies, body parts and blood which quite literally become architectural. In fact there are three distinct architectural structures here made of bodies, and many others large and small made of living men.For me the center of the thing is the early scene where the oracle is consulted. Three bits of background.¬ó when I see this plot device early in a movie, someone with a vision (or dream or hallucination) I tend to see the rest of the movie as what's in that vision. In other words here, when this girl reports what she sees in the future, the report is the movie that follows, and that we see through her eyes. It works for me because then I can ascribe the limits of the vision I see to the character I know shaped it.¬ó one of my most valued movie experiences is a very early short film. Shucks I see my comment on it here at IMDb is deleted. (If anyone saved it, please send it to me.) Its a dancer with flowing garments that sail with her in space. Over this has been hand painted color that overlaps the boundaries of the fabric, the first spatial artificial effect in film. Its transporting, this century-old image. Its copied in many ways here with the oracle's appearance. She's a drugged young beauty, and they use this as an excuse to have her dance, with smoke, hair, skin and fabric tendrils weaving space, sex, sense, vision. The designers of this scene were used nowhere else that I could tell. Its an extraordinary bit of art.¬ó There's something inherently cinematic about redheads. All filmmakers know this. Its in many how-to shortcut books. But like other fundamentals, no matter how hackneyed it gets, it can still be effective. In a film of actors whose hair has been blacked to seem Greek (and elsewhere skin darkened to seem ""Persian""), they find an Irish girl to play the oracle. I guess she's pretty; it's hard to tell because she's less a person than the provider of hair and a nipple in a complex assembly, but there you have the redhead, first seen doing a Gilda hair introduction.I saw this in a theater with a friend and despite dangerous political twinges we got swept up in it, together with the people in the auditorium. I think there's an analogy between the brotherhood of the men we see, and the implied brotherhood of the people in the audience. It brought us closer through vision. Film can do a lot worse.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,1994,6.9,A goofy detective specializing in animals goes in search of the missing mascot of the Miami Dolphins.,"While Ace Ventura:Pet Detective is not my favourite of Jim Carrey's movie, it is a lot of fun. It may be a tad too short, and some of the silliness is overdone. But even with any problems, that still doesn't change the fact that I enjoyed this film immensely. The film looks good with the cinematography and scenery top notch. The script is incredibly funny and I like to quote it too. The story is quite silly, but it is a nice one too, and the film is also very snappily paced. Tom Shadyac's direction is also very energetic and imaginative. This was the film that made Jim Carrey an overnight sensation and a fine one it is too to receive that honour. He is excellent in this film, his style of humour mayn't be for everybody, but when he is at his best he is funny or nicely understated as he is in his dramas. All in all, fast, furious and fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
Bruce Almighty,2003,6.8,A whiny news reporter is given the chance to step into God's shoes.,"If you want a serious laugh pain, watch this movie, and the things Bruce inflicts on his fellow newscaster. The deleted scenes are priceless. I don't know why they didn't include them in the original movie. It can't be because of time, since the movie is only 101 minutes long. Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor, who has been overlooked for too long. Jim Carrey needs meds!"
Billy Madison,1995,6.4,"In order to inherit his fed-up father Brian's hotel empire, immature and lazy Billy Madison must repeat grades one through twelve all over again. The further Billy progresses, the harder his hated rival Eric Gordon tries to stop him.","Looking at some of the reviews here reinforces the fact that there are certain people that like different types of humor. If stupid humor makes you laugh, this is your comedy. If you like stale British cerebral humor, maybe you should stay far away from this. I'm sure we all have our favorite and unfavorite comedians. I happen to like Sandler because he is immaturely funny. I think Dave Chapelle's show is pretty damn funny too. I never thought Sam Kinison was funny (the screaming is annoying) nor do I care for Chris Tucker.I saw Billy Madison at the theater, a friend and myself and the 8 other guys randomly scattered around the seating area found this to be pretty damn hilarious. I laughed at about 8 different scenes and that is a lot for me for any one movie. I still laugh at a few of the scenes when I see repeats and yes I have it on video.Those of you who dislike this movie are more than likely too old and stuck on your Bob Hope type era comedians and refuse to admit any others. Sandler isn't the greatest comedian who ever lived but his shtick was fresh and original when this movie came out. I have a video of him back when he did stand up and the guy is brilliant.Again, people who get easily annoyed and upset with the stupid type humor steer clear of this movie and save yourself the aggravation that these sad negative reviewers subjected themselves to."
Night at the Museum,2006,6.5,A newly recruited night security guard at the Museum of Natural History discovers that an ancient curse causes the animals and exhibits on display to come to life and wreak havoc.,"Excellent fun flick... and best movie Dinosaur in a long time ;-)I promised my 8th grade nephew I'd take him to a movie this Christmas break - without his younger brothers and sisters. He originally wanted to see that dragon movie, but he found out it sucked, so I suggested this one.With teens, there's the fine balance between too ""kid"" oriented and too dark, but he was laughing along the rest of the theater, and lost himself in the fun with the rest of us.He wants to see it again, *I* want to see it again, and I recommend it for anyone with a sense of fun. It's also the first Ben Stiller movie in a while I can say that about. I hope you all reward the studio for putting out a true ""family movie"" for the holidays, so we'll see more in the future.It was good to see Dick Van Dyke, Andy Rooney and Bill Cobbs in light, comic roles, and Robin Williams in a solid supporting role. They all lend the movie more ""credibility.""GREAT FUN, easily worth 2 hours and $10.00, more than once over."
Spider-Man 3,2007,6.3,"A strange black entity from another world bonds with Peter Parker and causes inner turmoil as he contends with new villains, temptations, and revenge.","By all means, Spider-Man 3 is not a bad movie, but the many flaws with the film make it the weakest of the series. But it is still enjoyable, however I did think the first two were better in terms of plot, characterisation and pacing. Well, there are a lot of good things. Out of the three films, this one is the best visually. The look of the whole film is mind blowing, with splendid special effects, brilliantly choreographed fight sequences and spectacular set pieces. The music is excellent, and the direction was efficient enough.And the acting is very good, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are appealing as Peter and Mary-Jane and Rosemary Harris sparkles as Auntie May. Topher Grace is great as Brock but underused as Venom, but as Sandman Thomas Haden Church was note perfect and the best developed of the villains. James Franco is an improvement as Harry, and Bryce Dallas Howard is delightfully photogenic as Gwen Stacey. I loved JK Simmons as Jameson, in all three Spider-Man movies he stole every scene he appeared in.However, there are a number of things that made it inferior to the first two. Basically and most importantly, and this was a similar problem I had with Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's End, it all felt a bit bloated. Two reasons made it so. One was too many characters. Primarily the villains, here, we get not one but three villains. While they were well performed, the character development of the villains felt rushed. Venom especially had way too little screen time as a result, and the final showdown between them felt a tad on the contrived side. Whereas you felt the menace of the Green Goblin and the tragedy of Dr Octopuss you are not always sure what to think here. Second, the plot as result to cramming too much in particularly with the idea of Spider-Man turning bad was rather convoluted, and was further disadvantaged by some surprisingly stodgy pacing. Other flaws were that the scripting lacked freshness and authenticity and the film was a bit too long.All in all, it certainly wasn't bad. As a matter of fact it was enjoyable. But it could've been better. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
Cars,2006,7.3,"On the way to the biggest race of his life, a hotshot rookie race car gets stranded in a rundown town and learns that winning isn't everything in life.","I'm a man (71). I took my son (40) and my granddaughter (10) to see ""Cars"". It was wonderful exciting entertainment for all our ages. I grew up with the old cars and have traveled Route 66 a few times so I was able to relate to the story and talk about the old times after the movie with the younger kids. My son and his daughter love NASCAR so they got a lot from the movie. The scenery though computer modified and generated was beautiful and true to the area portrayed. There is so much going on that this is one movie I want to see again. I have more grandkids, I think I'll have a valid excuse to go once more. Please!, if you see this movie remain seated until the very end of the credits, you are in for a treat."
Men in Black II,2002,6.2,Agent J is sent to find Agent K and restore his memory after the re-appearance of a case from K's past.,"Men in Black II (2002)* 1/2 (out of 4)Boring and bland sequel has Earth coming under attack from a dangerous alien (Lara Flynn Boyle) so Agent Jay (Will Smith) must bring Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) out of retirement. I really wasn't sure what to expect out of this sequel but the very, very, very last thing I did expect was something boring. I must admit that I was really shocked to see how bland and downright bad this movie was as sadly it's yet another example of a sequel to a good movie being about nothing more than money. The original film was smart, clever and funny in regards to the subject matter but this sequel just lacks any sort of originality and it's really nothing more than a copy of the original. What's so sad is that there could have been so many good and interesting story ideas but sadly we're just given a copy of the first film and we even get many of the same jokes. It's funny to think that the jokes worked so well the first time but here they're just annoying and unfunny. I think the majority of the blame has to go towards the screenplay, which is just a mess. It's never funny, never makes too much sense and sadly it's clear that very little went into it. The performances outside of Tommy Lee Jones really aren't all that memorable either. Lara Flynn Boyle has no problems looking sexy but her character is bland. Rip Torn isn't given much to do and the same is true for Johnny Knoxville and Rosario Dawson. The incredibly bad love story with Dawson is just an embarrassment. MEN IN BLACK II even features some very poor CGI effects and in the end this is just a rather worthless movie that isn't worth the trouble."
Underworld,2003,7.0,"Selene, a vampire warrior, is entrenched in a conflict between vampires and werewolves, while falling in love with Michael, a human who is sought by werewolves for unknown reasons.","The ""Underworld"" sequel will soon be out so now is a good time to revisit the original. Personally I enjoyed this film more than any high budget ""mainstream movie"" I have seen in years years. But I can see many of the problems others have pointed out. Although the small action scenes work very well, the more elaborate scenes are disjointed, confused, and somewhat silly. If you compare the opening subway sequence to the train station sequence in ""The Untouchables"", you see an illustration of why less is better; and ""Underworld"" expends more ammo for less effect than anything this side of a ""Godzilla"" film.Along with too much aggressive confusion is the silliest head-splitting in cinema history. Similar to the way Tarentino dispatched Lucy Lie in ""Kill Bill Vol.1"" (i.e. a delay in the actual detachment-I don't know which film did it first but Tarentine did it way better), the effects editor overlooked the need to show a slice in the head before it topples off. Surely this was just simple incompetence and not deliberate, because there are ways to show this (i.e. a line) that would still make it a relatively shocking scene.The story itself breaks too many horror genre conventions and fails to generate much real suspense (although the climax is somewhat surprising). But ultimately these problems did not interfere with my enjoyment of the movie.This was because it is first and foremost a Kate Beckensale's vehicle, as emphasized by recent trailer for the sequel. It is likely that your feeling about the film will depend on your impression of Beckensale. She has never looked better and I'm just talking about her face which I could watch in closeup for two hours without the slightest complaint. She is increasingly an absolute ringer for a 1940-ish Loretta Young. An earlier comment noted that: ""This 30 year old has the figure and face of a magazine model, with the bored flat expression to match. Pour this tight little body into a rubber suit with especially reflective pants and you have something to anchor your movie"". All this is very true but add intelligence, subtlety and nuance not seen since Diana Rigg was playing Mrs. Peel. The film does not demonstrate her range (you have to watch ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" for the best evidence of that) but it is one of those rare cases where you can't imagine anyone but her in the role.The production design, lighting, and cinematography are all excellent and the DVD has some great features explaining these aspects of the production.The film has a nice consistent look that fits very well with the story. I don't understand the comments that are negative overall, or what films these people are unfavorably comparing it to, can't be the garbage films that have been coming to mainstream theaters over the past few years. Bottom line, if you like the genre, appreciate stylish production design, and think highly of Ms. Beckensale you should make it a point to see this movie."
Legion,2010,5.3,"When a group of strangers at a dusty roadside diner come under attack by demonic forces, their only chance for survival lies with an archangel named Michael, who informs a pregnant waitress that her unborn child is humanity's last hope.","This movie didn't arrive in my country with much fanfare, so before I bought a ticket I did some research. Most reviews were negative, but I went to see it out of pure boredom. I didn't expect much and having read all the negative reviews I watched it with my critics glasses on.I actually enjoyed this movie. Never have I given a movie 8/10 before. Why did I do it now? Performances. I reckon the people who went out to see this movie expected blood, guts and fecal matter flying all over the place. Instead they found hardcore actors doing what they do best. Even lesser known actors were up there doing it with the masters of the industry. Paul Bettany is one of the most underrated actors of our time. When has he ever given anything but a solid performance? Dennis Quaid? His prettiness might be a thing of the past, but as a performer he grows with every movie he makes. The same goes for the whole cast. They all acted like superstars.You won't like this movie if you're into mindless B-grade BS. If, however, you like movies because the actors telling the story makes a fantasy feel so real you actually feel you're gonna break the armrests off your chair you should do yourself a favor and see this movie.On a final note. Being a Christian myself I did not find this movie offensive at all."
The Cable Guy,1996,6.1,A designer makes a grievous mistake when he rejects the friendship of a borderline cable guy.,"This is the first comment I've ever written, so I thought I'd right it about my favorite movie. This is one of the only two 10's I've ever given, and not just because it's underrated, which it is. This is one of the most hilarious movies I've ever seen, and easily the best dark comedy ever conceived. Ben Stiller is a great director, Jim Carrey is amazing, and Broderick isn't as annoying as everyone says he is. The only possible reason this movie's rating is so low is that many people watched this thinking they were watching another dumb and silly Jim Carrey comedy. This movie is actually very smart. So, if you watch this movie knowing that it is not the usual Jim Carrey fare, you will probably love this movie as much as I did."
War of the Worlds,2005,6.6,An alien invasion threatens the future of humanity. The catastrophic nightmare is depicted through the eyes of one American family fighting for survival.,"This movie had huge potential. Everything to make this a science-fiction classic masterpiece were present; Spielberg's directing, a great concept, ILM special effects, Tom Cruise as the main character and lots of other professionals involved both in front and behind the cameras. Then where did it go wrong? The answer to that is the script. The story is very simple and lacks a real clear plot line. Basically the movie is only about Tom Cruise and his two children running and driving from city to city, from the aliens and their destructive Tripod-machines. Exactly why are we, out of all the people, following these persons? The character development is lacking, just as much as the story does. Both lack development and depth.Of course the movie is by no means an horrible movie but it's just that the movie is a bit disappointing because of the fact that it had so much more potential. It still is a good and certainly spectacular movie to watch but it's not a movie people will still talk about in 5 or 10 years from now. The story makes this movie a bit of an easily forgettable movie that doesn't leave an huge impression afterward, even though the movie itself is pure eye-candy to watch.There is no doubt about it that Spielberg is a great director. He directs his actors in this movie very well and everyone in the movie gives an amazing performance, especially Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning. Tom Cruise for once again doesn't play the action hero. He is an average Joe instead and I think he did this in a very good and convincing. Spielberg also uses the special effects very well. He doesn't use the special effects to impress the audience as much as possible, with lots of spectacular and action filled sequences, which he could had easily had done, he uses them as a tool to tell the story with instead. The movie is purely told from Tom Cruise and his family's perspective, because of this the movie gets a very realistic feeling. We don't get to see any close-ups of the Tripods and how they destroy entire cities and fight off the American army. I like this approach. It makes ""War of the Worlds"" different from many other alien-invasion movies. It because of this certainly is one of the most believable and realistic alien-invasion movies, along with ""Signs"".Visually there also is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. The special effects from ILM are very impressive and look extremely convincing. The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is also simply phenomenal at times and is typically gritty, which certainly adds to the tense and realistic atmosphere of the movie.Unlike others, to me the ending didn't came really abrupt. But perhaps this was because to me the ending was already spoiled, thanks to the movie it's soundtrack, which featured the final narration of Morgan Freeman explaining how the movie ended. So I already knew what to expect. To be perfectly honest I liked the ending and I couldn't think of any other, or better way to end this movie, without losing any of its realism and credibility. I can understand how it might seem lame and sudden to most though but for me it was satisfying enough.It certainly is a movie that will receive one or two, most likely, technical Acedemy Awards. And it deserves to. There isn't an awful lot wrong with this movie but it truly is the simple story that prevents this movie from being a classic or masterpiece. I still regard this movie as one of the must sees of 2005 simply because of the movie its look and acting. You can tell by watching this movie that there was lots of talent involved, both in front and behind the cameras. Especially Spielberg's touch still makes this movie better than just the average alien-invasion movie but still not even he can prevent this movie from being a bit of a disappointment. Not his or anybody else his/her fault, simply blame it on the script.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
Ice Age: The Meltdown,2006,6.8,"Manny, Sid and Diego discover that the ice age is coming to an end, and join everybody for a journey to higher ground. On the trip, they discover that Manny is not in fact the last of the woolly mammoths.","Ice Age is one of the best animations ever made so I was excited about the return of Scrat & co. While the new adventure doesn't have the same emotional impact as the first (less tear-jerky, I mean), it makes up for it with comedy. Scrat's attempts to hang on to his acorn are longer & even more hilarious. The Possums & their big ""sister"" are excellent new characters, providing their own share of the laughs. The romance plot is less dramatic than the baby's tale, sometimes slowing the action. However it's sweet & provides some fun dialogue. Sid is brilliant, his mini adventure a definite highlight. Diego's role is reduced, but still vital. He's especially funny with Sid. If you enjoy the Ice Age films, I also recommend The Land Before Time adventures. They share the same formula & the same heart. 8/10"
Mr. Deeds,2002,5.8,A sweet-natured small-town guy inherits a controlling stake in a media conglomerate and begins to do business his way.,"Mr. Deeds is very similar to many other Adam Sandler films. The film follows a basic and predictable formula. Many of the comedian's reliable standards are in effect: abuse of old folks, crude humor, a Rob Schneider appearance, and mentally deficient sidekicks. Some of the stuff works, but there's not much room for originality. This movie even perpetuates Sandler's trend of playing guys who are unexpectedly good at dishing out beatings.Many have considered Mr. Deeds to be one of Adam Sandler's more underrated films, and in several ways it is. However the film is typical but entertaining in some areas. It is a decent comedy, and the humor is what one would expect from a Sandler film."
Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls,1995,6.4,"Ace Ventura, Pet Detective, returns from a spiritual quest to investigate the disappearance of a rare white bat, the sacred animal of a tribe in Africa.","Jim Carrey is one of those actors you will find yourself either adoring or hating. He does not ever ""underact."" This movie made me laugh so hard I cried (even after the fifth time!) From the robot rhino scene to the monopoly guy Jim knows how to be hilarious. I saw the first one (liked it a lot) and have to say this one is way better! I am a huge fan of Carrey. I don't think there are many people who can make such a variety of facial expressions. The only reason this is not a ten is because there is (as usual with Carrey) some inappropriate stuff thrown in. But if your love laughing and you love Jim, this movie will fit you ""Like a glove!"""
Little Nicky,2000,5.3,"After two of the devil's three sons escape Hell to wreak havoc on Earth, the devil must send his third son, the mild-mannered Nicky, to bring them back before it's too late.","Satan has decided to stay in charge of Hell for a few more years, a decision that enrages two of his sons (Adrian and Cassius) who decide to create their own Hell on Earth and rule there instead. Whenever they leave Hell, Satan's powers begin to fade and has less than a week before he will be destroyed. With no choice but to send his third, weaker son, Satan sends Nicky to Earth to capture his brothers and bring them back to Hell and restore the norm. However the simple and na√Øve Nicky struggles to cut it in the real world.I will always give Adam Sadler films a go because I often find just about enough moments of inspired lunacy among the puerile and pretty unfunny material. Sadly, this outing sees such a terrible plot combined with awful acting, unfunny writing, tired special effects and crude joking and almost no moments that took me by surprise and made me laugh. Instead the film is just plain stupid with very few laughs in it at all. Of course it may well appeal to some with its silly humour and its silly crude joking but personally it was pretty laugh free and the whole idea of the film was too dumb and silly to really work. The actual plot is never a really strong aspect of any Sadler film but here it is just all over the place. It is not that it makes no sense, it is more that it lacks any sense of fun at all and the dark tone is totally misjudged and the usual moments of inspired craziness is really limited to one or two moments (the best being the Fonz covered in bees!).The cr*p script is not helped at all by a cast that is either rubbish or wasted. Sadler himself falls into the 'rubbish' camp with a performance that is like his usual mugging but even more unbearable. With his twisted expression and nasty voice, he was actually painful to watch ¬ñ and this is not based on a hatred of Sadler (I loved him in Punchdrunk a few days ago) it is based on the fact that this is a terrible performance with nothing but a terrible idea and a terrible character to work with. The support cast is made up of plenty of well-known faces but few are used well at all and too many of them are embarrassing. Keitel falls into the latter category and he has a thankless role that is not worthy of his talent. Ifans and Lister are given hard work by mostly doing voice work with poor dialogue (in their heads) and they were not funny at all. Arquette is given nothing to do at all but still manages to be lame and annoying. The various cameos are mixed ¬ñ Taratino is just dumb; Dangerfield is OK but not given enough time; Weathers, Witherspoon, Witherspoon and others are all given nothing to do other than show their faces but Lovitz and Schneider at least provide some unexpected weirdness in very minor roles.Overall, Sadler films are normally average at best but I must say that I found this to be devoid of all but the slightest hint of the inspired humour that he can often create. The story is stupid and silly, the acting both bad and embarrassing, the script filled with misfiring jokes that are mostly in bad taste as well as being unfunny (a bad combination). A real waste of time that will only appeal to the most die-hard fans of Sadler and those that only like their comedy to be very basic indeed."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,2011,4.4,"Johnny Blaze, tortured by the Ghost Rider's curse, gets a chance of redemption through protecting the Devil's son, whose father is pursuing him.","The first Ghost Rider was already a disappointment ‚Äì compared to other Marvel adaptations to the cinema, it was far under the average. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, however, is even worse. It didn't even look like a big Hollywood production ‚Äì the special effects and the action sequences were sometimes absurd going to the ridiculous. It looked like a low budget film ‚Äì a poor visual with only one or two exciting scenes - if I can call them exciting.Then, there is the plot issue. Those 'blockbusters' are not supposed to have a story with philosophical meanings as they are made aiming pure entertainment, but this one actually didn't even have a story. It was totally redundant, silly and clich√© ‚Äì actually kind of ambiguous because the characters were not well explained or explored - things seemed too much up in the air leading the audience to nowhere.Nicolas Cage also didn't help at all as he was not convincing on what he was doing. But, we can't put all the blame on him ‚Äì the character was already badly written by the screenwriters who didn't know how to make him interesting. The Ghost Rider is not the conventional superhero ‚Äì he has an obscure personality. So, where is this aspect on the story? Where is the true nature of the Marvel superheroes? In this film, there isn't any.What surprises me most is the fact that this film coasted $75 million and no one knew how to make a good use of this big budget. It was a total waste of money and time ‚Äì not only for the audience, but for the actors too. A superhero movie that promises more than it really has to offer. If you didn't like the first film, you'll probably hate this one."
No Strings Attached,2011,6.2,"A guy and girl try to keep their relationship strictly physical, but it's not long before they learn that they want something more.","I gave this movie an 8/10 simply because it will keep you laughing the majority of the time. Sure the ending is predictable and a few of the background actors deliver lackluster performances but Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher fit very nicely together as the main characters, you could really tell they had fun working together.I see a lot of other reviews criticizing Portman for ""stooping to this level"" and I'm not too sure why, maybe they didn't go see it in the right frame of mind...this movie is what it is, a romantic comedy about two friends who decide to take their relationship to the next level without having any of the commitments and ""duties"" of being an actual couple, that's what the trailers showed it as, that's what the actors described it as, nothing was a surprise...she did a cute, funny romantic comedy, it's not like she dove head first into the adult film industry.Will this movie be nominated for awards, probably, will it win, probably not, but overall it was cute, it was funny, and I left the theater feeling like the $10 I paid for a ticket was well worth it."
2012,2009,5.8,A frustrated writer struggles to keep his family alive when a series of global catastrophes threatens to annihilate mankind.,"After watching this movie I really needed time to figure out what to think of it. I heard a lady sharing her first comment to her friend: 'That dog sure was ugly'. What else was there to say? After a while I found out:The action was truly formidable, demonstrating the power of 'mother nature'. Collapsing buildings, jumping flaming cars, planes falling down and manage to pull up a second before touchdown, it was a real trip and a feast for the eyes and ears.But then again... the acting wasn't that good, a bit over the top. In one scene in the movie, where every wasted second could be the cause of a terrible disaster, *they* waste their time being...ROMANTIC! At times like that the acting became very juicy, making me think I was watching 'Titanic' instead.One point of advise: Do not take this movie too seriously. It's almost stuffed with jokes instead of showing us the real drama of an earth that is about to be destroyed. But keep this in mind and you'll have a heck of a 2 hours and 40 minutes(!) in a movie that is made for the cinema."
World War Z,2013,7.0,Former United Nations employee Gerry Lane traverses the world in a race against time to stop a zombie pandemic that is toppling armies and governments and threatens to destroy humanity itself.,"I skipped this when it came out because I was sick of the Zombie theme. This one intrigued me because it was written by Mel Brooks' son, Max; however, not enough to watch it. I was wrong. It is good because it is an action film first, and a Zombie film second. Brad Pitt is very good as an agent living a normal life until the crisis calls him out of his retirement. The cinematography is way too shaky for me and that is my major criticism of the visuals in the movie. The script, dialogue, plot, acting , and directing are all very good. I like this one and it stands out in the swarm of Zombie films."
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,2011,6.6,"Jack Sparrow and Barbossa embark on a quest to find the elusive fountain of youth, only to discover that Blackbeard and his daughter are after it too.","The franchise has shifted. The 'first trilogy' was visually-centered. It was quite literally a ride, allowing Depp room to creatively be silly. Some of the cinematic stretch was significant, and I still remember the Shackleford reference fondly.This is something entirely different. Sure, it has busy sequences and characters from the same universe. But now we have something story- centric. Images are pasted onto the story rather than the other way around.There's even an excess of story and excess within story with the excess being a character itself.There are at least three love stories, one of them tender and conventional, all of them centered on Catalonian women.There is something of an overarching battle between Christianity and the supernatural. The extreme irony is that the Spaniards are the token of the faith. In actual life, they were the ones who invented the notions of supernatural evil, the first continental faith-based genocide and New World slavery.There is a nice little revenge story that references Moby Dick. And at the end two Peter Pan like affirmations of the (pirate's) life of adventure.I liked it. I liked the gush and mix of narrative. I liked the appropriation of Almodovarian values. But I have to say that no one knew how to leverage Penelope the way Pedro can. She is not inventive like Johnny and Geoffrey. She is a vessel, a vulnerable vessel that can be filled with female assets. But she has to gather that from the environment. Making her into something even Geena Davis and her lover could not do is a sacrilege."
Van Helsing,2004,6.1,"The famed monster hunter is sent to Transylvania to stop Count Dracula, who is using Dr. Frankenstein's research and a werewolf for nefarious purposes.","Despite the inconsistent CG, some weak performances and some dumb decisions Van Helsing is still a fun and enjoyable fantasy adventure. Hugh Jackman gives a great lead performance and Kate Beckinsale, Richard Roxburgh and David Wenham are all really good. It's well paced and well filmed and Stephen Sommer's direction is good, if a little too reliant on CG. The music by Alan Silversti is great."
Resident Evil: Apocalypse,2004,6.1,"Alice wakes up in the Raccoon City hospital after the area has been overrun by zombies, and must now make it out of the city before a nuclear bomb is dropped.","*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*Lethal megababe Alice, (Milla Jovovich), is back. The Hive gets reopened for some reason. The zombies take advantage of the human's blunder and pour out into Racoon City. Alice and another hot chick decide to bring the war to the zombies. The rest of the movie is one long fight scene with zombie dogs, slobbering creatures and a big monster with a rocket launcher all wanting to waste the killer babe squad.While ""Resident Evil 2"" is light on plot, it is heavy on kills, explosions and various other forms of mayhem. I definitely felt I got my money's worth. There are really only two differences between this movie and the original ""Resident Evil"". One, this movie introduces a new monster, the Nemesis. It's a big monster with bad teeth wearing an overcoat and wielding a rocket launcher. The other difference is that they added another hot woman to the zombie killing mix. Alice needed some babe backup. Overall, I was pleased with this one. It's worth a look."
Bad Boys II,2003,6.6,Two loose-cannon narcotics cops investigate the flow of Ecstasy into Florida from a Cuban drug cartel.,Bad Boys 2 is basically what you'd expect. Everything from the original gets amped up. The story is more ridiculous and less contained. There's no restraint here just pure Bay indulgence. This movie is bonkers but it knows exactly what it is and doesn't pretend to be anything it's not. I can respect that and I appreciate this movie more than the original for that very reason.
The Devil Wears Prada,2006,7.0,"With an aspiration to become a journalist, Andy, a smart but sensible young graduate, travels to New York. She starts working as an assistant to one of the city's biggest high fashion magazine editors, the cynical Miranda Priestly.","Unmissable for Meryl Streep fans. She plays second fiddle to Anne Hathaway here - screen time wise, otherwise she's the whole bloody orchestra. She's the one reason to see the film and that in itself is one hell of a reason. Meryl Streep is fearless and part of the joy of going to see her films is that we know for a fact that she's going to dare and dare and dare. From Sophie's Choice and A Cry in The Dark to Death Becomes Her and Plenty. Here the story is as unbearable as most TV commercials but she, Meryl/Miranda transforms it into something else. We connect with her evil queen because her evil queen is much more real, much more human than anybody else on the screen. Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci are fun but they're in the periphery of a story that's so wafer thing they can't really move to the center. Anne Hathaway is kind of invisible and her character only changes costumes and make up. There is no real tangible growth. Now that I got that out of my system. Go see Meryl be Miranda. You'll have a lot of fun."
Highlander,,7.2,"Duncan MacLeod is Immortal, and must live in modern society, concealing his true nature while fighting other Immortals.","Your average ¬ÑHighlander""-fan had a hard time deciding whether a series following two sequels to the original movie: having watched the abominable ""Highlander: The Sorcerer"" and ""Highlander: The Quickening"", arguably one of the worst movies ever produced, had left scars and had made the fan suspicious.And how could one not have watched the pilot, knowing that Christopher Lambert would reprise his role as Connor McLeod, introducing the series leading man, Duncan McLeod (Adrian Paul)? The first seasons were slightly tedious, being too TV-ish and, apparently, produced in auto-mode: a few flashbacks in time, Duncan battling (and eventually beheading, though always TV-compatible; no blood, no gore) another immortal; Duncan's relationship with Tessa, etc. Often Adrian Paul's sidekicks, namely Richie (Stan Kirsch) and Amanda (Elizabeth Gracen) would become tedious but casting Adrian Paul ‚Äì although it's unlikely that the actor will ever score an Oscar ‚Äì compensating for a lot, him having a similar amiable acting style to the original Highlander, Christopher Lambert. By the end of the second season, story lines became more concrete, interesting and the guest-stars more selected ‚Äì to name just a few, Roger Daltrey, Kabir Bedi, Werner Stocker, hey, even Roland Gift, singer of the ""Fine Young Cannibals"", played an immortal.It may not matter to the general viewer, but what has bothered many-a more 'fanatic' fan, is the fact that the series kept altering the ""Highlander""-canon: there are female immortals (not being chauvinistic, but such it was in the original film), the ""Quickening"" was no longer about the assembling of the last immortals, but simply a prize, which one immortal from each generation could win; the immortals actually died for a while when being 'killed', then returned to life, while the immortals in ""Highlander"" never died, may they be underwater, having their throats cut or being crushed by elevators. Or take the concept of 'The Watchers', even though Sean Connery assured us that, ""no one hash ever known we were among you....until now"". But how else to keep a long-running TV-series running, without adding or changing something in the storyline? All in all, one was saddened when the series finally came to an end, having gotten fond of the characters and willing to watch a few more episodes. It was a good seven year run, definitely worth watching, even if you've skipped the last three installments of the ""Highlander"" movie-franchise.Overall, a good 7 points from 10."
Safe,2012,6.5,"Mei, a young girl whose memory holds a priceless numerical code, finds herself pursued by the Triads, the Russian mob, and corrupt NYC cops. Coming to her aid is an ex-cage fighter whose life was destroyed by the gangsters on Mei's trail.","Mei (Catherine Chan) is a little genius when it comes to numbers. She can remember everything and calculate anything in her mind. That's why she's very valuable for the Chinese Triads, who use her as a computer that can't be hacked or traced. One day, she's asked to memorize a long number and drive to another place to learn a different one. But the Russian mob steps in and assaults her ride, killing almost everyone. Mei can escape and this is when she meets Luke Wright (Jason Statham). Former elite cop, former small time MMA fighter, on the run from the Russian mob who lost a bunch of money for betting against him in a match and killed his wife in revenge. The will to protect this little girl gives him a new will to live, a drive to go on. And so they run away; away from the Triads, the mob and the corrupt NYPD, trying to figure out why everyone wants either those numbers or her death.It's a bit of Mercury Puzzle and 16 Blocks. And despite my usual fears, the story did not turn cheesy due to the kid. But the girl didn't turn into an unrealistic bad ass as well. Also they did not develop a forced deep relationship between Luke and Mei, which would be unrealistic, considering that the story doesn't go that long. The film is featuring fast paced action, wrapped into a decent (though not great) story and is supported by good acting. Well, at least good acting from the leading characters, but the supporting ones weren't that bad as well, so you don't have to suffer from it. So overall, a quite enjoyable movie, which I would recommend to fans of story driven action movies and especially to all Statham fans.Just for fun, let's check the Statham clich√©s. Shirtless? Yep, first time you see him in the movie. Car-chase? Of course. And when Mei was a bit concerned about his driving style, I was just waiting for a comeback from him that was like ""Don't worry kid, I've been doing this for several movies now."""
Daredevil,2003,5.3,A man blinded by toxic waste which also enhanced his remaining senses fights crime as an acrobatic martial arts superhero.,"Reviewers say 'Daredevil' has mixed reviews, highlighting its darker tone and complex characters. Many appreciate the gritty atmosphere, while others criticize its pacing and underdeveloped plot. Ben Affleck's performance is contentious, with varied opinions on his portrayal. Colin Farrell's Bullseye is often praised. The film's visual style and special effects receive mixed feedback. The love story between Daredevil and Elektra is divisive. Overall, 'Daredevil' is seen as an ambitious but flawed superhero movie."
Highlander 5,,3.0,Duncan MacLeod and his fellow Immortals quest to locate the Grail of their world.,"OK, I've watched & loved, Highlander the series.... I enjoyed it more than the movies themselves. Adrian Paul is a really talented actor & though I feel their acting was dead on... the script for this movie was HORRIBLE.It was as awful as Highlander II... it just left me feeling like someone... wanted to revive the movie to make a few dollars. It was as if they threw this script together on a weekend & convinced some great actors this was a good idea.Highlander creators... we'll act like this didn't happen if you promise not to produce another movie to finance a new house.2 thumbs, way down.Such a cool series, such a bad movie."
The Da Vinci Code,2006,6.6,A murder and clues in paintings lead to the discovery of a closely guarded religious mystery.,"Last Tuesday, when The Da Vinci Code premiered at the Cannes Film festival, it was met with a chilly reception from the reviewing elite. It has been called ""plodding,"" ""stale,"" and ""uninspired,"" thus, dashing the hopes of many movie goers who were hoping to see one of their favorite novels brought to life by one of their favorite directors, and starring one of their favorite actors. Since I'm not a slave to snobby film reviewers, I went to go see it for myself despite the negative hype. And as the credits rolled at the end of the movie, I felt increasingly unsettled; not because of the quality of the movie, but because one question lingered in my head: What's not to like? Am I crazy for actually being entertained by what I just saw? How could the critics pan what I, and those around me, seemed to enjoy? Okay, so that's more than one question....First, I have to qualify myself. I read the book and I LOVED it; couldn't put it down. I loved the history, the speculation, the riddles and puzzles, and the masterful blend of fact and fiction. Additionally, I'm not religious, although I was definitely familiar with Christian historical icons such as Jesus, John the Baptist, and Mary Magdelene before I read the book. I also happen to be a big fan of Tom Hanks, Ron Howard, and Ian McKellan.Having said that, I went in prepared to like this movie, even though I had somewhat lowered my expectations based on the barrage of bad reviews. All of this proved to be a winning formula for me, apparently.If you're like me and you loved the book and you like the artistic team that pursued making it into a movie, then you'll most likely come out satisfied. You won't mind what many critics have called ""overly-long exposition"" and historical flashbacks, because that's pretty much what the book consisted of. And in the book, it was absolutely engrossing! So, I personally didn't mind all of the explanation of history, symbols, etc.Critics have also found fault with Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou's portrayals of Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu (respectively), saying that they delivered flat performances. But once again, whoever read the book will remember that both of these characters weren't that dynamic on the written page, either. Of course, Sir Ian McKellan, with the juiciest role of Holy Grail scholar Sir Leigh Teabing, chews up the scenery every time he's shown on screen. Sir Leigh Teabing was also one of the richest characters in the book.I think that the people who won't like this movie are people who didn't read the book, and are going into the theater expecting a regular movie, which it's not. It's an adaptation of a very wordy, detailed, twisting, speculative novel that blends fact and fiction in a devastatingly effective way, and it's easy to get lost while watching the movie if you don't already know where the story is going. Sure, Ron Howard uses digitized, grainy flashbacks of ancient pagan rituals and societies to move the narrative along and to keep the audience on point, but I can see how it could be overwhelming to those who only know the bare bones of the plot. However, those who found it fascinating in the book will find pleasure in seeing the visual accompaniment to what they've already read.In short, you go see this movie (or read the book) for how it challenges popularly-held beliefs; not for its rich, engaging character development. It's a quest for the ""truth"", and in terms of the IDEAS expressed, they did a dag-blasted good job of translating those ideas onto the screen. Those who often complain that movies don't stay true to the books that they're based on will find comfort in the fact that Akiva Goldsman and Ron Howard have stayed incredibly close to the original text when translating it onto the screen. However, this will be to the dismay of those movie-goers who haven't read the book, and are therefore expecting a traditional action thriller with traditional action thriller dialogue.If you go to RottenTomatoes.com, you'll see the huge disparity between what the critics have said, and what the users have said regarding this film. While the cumulative critics rating is a dismal 22%, the combined user rating is a 74%, which is way above average for the site. That should speak volumes to whoever is skeptical about seeing the movie because of the bad reviews.The bottom line is that it's definitely a movie worth watching if only to see how the creative team behind it went about turning the best-selling novel into celluloid. It's also a treat to see something in popular culture challenge popular religious ideals so skillfully, even if only in the form of fiction.My advice: go see for yourself."
Green Lantern,2011,5.5,"Reckless test pilot Hal Jordan is granted an alien ring that bestows him with otherworldly powers that inducts him into an intergalactic police force, the Green Lantern Corps.","Now let me begin by saying this film is not an amazing film. It is definitely not an awful film, like most critics are saying. I think critics might have raised their expectations due to Thor and X-Men: First Class. They should not compare the Green Lantern with those films. It is ranked now 24% on Rotten Tomatoes, which is way too low. It would probably be in the high 60s, if it was released before Thor and X-Men: First Class.The acting in the film is good and not terrible at all. Ryan Reynolds is great as Hal Jordan and extremely likable. He definitely fits the role as Hal Jordan really well. Blake Lively is great and extremely sexy, she's not just a pretty face as most are suggesting. Peter Sarsgaard is a great actor and he plays the villainous Hector Hemmond really well and interesting. Overall everyone tries their best and at the end of the day do a really great job, certainly no Oscar worthy performances, though.The special effects are pretty superb and extremely worthwhile to say the least. Although it sometimes feel a little CGIish, but it doesn't get too big of a distraction. I have to say I was a little disappointed how Parallax looked like, it felt a little fake at times, but it is not horrible in any sense of the way. Also the film did not take itself seriously which is kind of refreshing. Which could be the reason why critics disliked it so much. They want another sad, personal and serious story. Unlike Thor and X-Men, The Green Lantern is more kids friendly.The main problem of the film was that they were trying to cram stuff in from the comics and the personal lives of the other characters. It seems that there could be so many sequels for the other characters. It did kind of focus on too many characters. Also the editing gets to be a little distracting at times, they certainly needed to have done a better job, but the editing is mediocre at best.Overall the Green Lantern was a fun summer flick. Although it is nowhere near the realm of The Dark Knight, it didn't need to be. The 3D was actually really good and the special effects were memorable. No doubt, the critics were extremely tough on the Green Lantern and it is unfair. At the end of the day, don't listen to the critics. Make up your mind and see this film. At the end of the day, it should be only your opinion that matters to you. You might agree with the critics or you might not. However don't skip this movie because of the low Rotten Tomatoes score."
You Don't Mess with the Zohan,2008,5.6,An Israeli Special Forces Soldier fakes his death so he can re-emerge in New York City as a hair stylist.,"Look folks, this is ADAM SANDLER we're talking about here. Yes, this is the same stuff that he was doing ten years ago with ""The Waterboy."" Yes, this is the same company that brought us ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""Click."" And yes, while I have aged a bit since I could appreciate the his silliness, there is still a part of me that enjoys the goofy fun that Adam Sandler likes to put on screen. I knew very well coming in to the 7:45 showing of ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" that this was going to be crazy. And sure enough, it was. But you know what, I liked it, my friend liked it, quite a few people in the audience liked it, it was a good time had.Adam Sandler loves to put himself in ridiculous situations. In ""Gilmore,"" he was a hockey nut with a hidden talent for golf. In ""Mr. Deeds,"" he became a billionaire overnight. This guy has played football (twice), gone on fifty first dates, paused and sped up his life, and married Kevin James. Now, he's an Isreali counter-terrorist with a fetish for cutting hair. Oh, and he loves making sexual remarks as much as Borat does. Sound familiar? Thought it did.So how does the humor compare to previous Sandler features? Well, it's unfocused. Part of the problem is that three writers with different mentalities are writing the script. The silliness comes from Sandler, the raunchy stuff comes from Apatow, and everything else comes from Smigel. Although I found myself laughing at quite a few parts (particularly when the Zohan was on the job as a soldier), there were also a lot of parts where I was thinking to myself ""Come on. Another shot of the crotch?"" (Or butt, or some other sexual reference) All of these various ingredients have been thrown in together, and the end result is, let's face it, uneven.But though the movie may have lacked focus, I couldn't help but have fun with it. You see, unlike ""Mr. Deeds"" (which I found boring and lame), this film goes whole hog. Sandler and the cast surrounding him do almost everything in their power to make a joke out of something. These guys aren't sleepwalking through their roles, to the contrary, they're having a great time putting on a show. It's contagious. About halfway through the movie, I began to realize the reason I was having fun with the ""Zohan"" was because this movie essentially gives out an open invitation to enjoy the silliness that was being presented. By the end of the movie, Sandler had done the most outrageous acts I had seen him do since ""Happy Gilmore."" And frankly, I think I prefer Sandler when he just tries everything.Fans of Sandler will most likely enjoy this one, non-fans should pass. For what it's worth, ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" is a good continuation of the act Sandler has put on for us for over a decade now. Worth a Saturday matin√©e."
Back to the Future Part II,1989,7.8,"After visiting 2015, Marty McFly must repeat his visit to 1955 to prevent disastrous changes to 1985...without interfering with his first trip.","I'm one lucky girl, I rented all three Back to the Future films, so I could watch them all in a row, I didn't have to wait year after year, well I was kinda born in 1985, so it's all good. But anyways, I just saw the Back to the Future trilogy tonite and after it seeming like I was the only person who didn't see these movies, I did it! Part two was a very good sequel, while it isn't quite up to par with the first Back to the Future, it was cool, it was kinda like Deja Vu with a different story that worked.Marty and Jennifer start off where the first left off, Doc takes them to the year 2015(which is funny that it is only 8 years away), and Doc tells Marty to fix a situation with his future son. Biff overhears an idea later brought up to Doc about possibly giving himself tips to win big money for the future as soon as they go back, but Doc talks him out of it, but Biff has different plans and takes the book and the De Lauren and goes back to 1955 and makes himself the richest man alive in 1985, so Marty and The Doc must go back and alter the future back to it's old ways.Part two is definitely worth a look for those Back to the Future fans, not to mention, it's just good to see where these stories go. Like I said, it's not as good as the first, but it is a good movie and actually a little better than a 7.1, if you ask me. But that's just me, so just give this movie a chance, you just might find yourself enjoying it.9/10"
A Dangerous Method,2011,6.4,A look at how the intense relationship between Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud gives birth to psychoanalysis.,"I must admit, going into this film, I was rather excited; I've enjoyed both of David Cronenberg and Viggo Mortensen's previous collaborations and my interest in both Freudian psychology/psychoanalysis and Michael Fassbender practically guaranteed that I would be seeing this film. I fear now, however, that my expectations may have been a bit too high.I must admit, however, that I thought that Michael Fassbender and Viggo Mortensen played their roles very well, although Mortensen definitely didn't receive as much screen time as he deserved. Vincent Cassel definitely shone in his extended cameo as Otto Gross. I did have some issues with Keira Knightly's acting, however. I feel like she may have over exaggerated her actions, particularly in the beginning scenes where she is in the midst of hysteria.However, my real problem with this film is that, for lack of a better term, it all seems a little too shallow. Events that should be important are skimmed over and not explained; to be honest, it doesn't particularly seem like anything of real importance happens in the film. The characters have little depth; despite the fact that they are all playing rather well known persons, there simply isn't anything to them other than a name. On top of this, despite what the taglines of the film and trailer seem to suggest, the relationship between Freud and Jung is hardly explored. For the most part, their scenes involve reading letters from the other. This is hardly compelling viewing.Overall, I feel like this film would have been better if it had been longer. If the film had a running time of even two hours, compared to one and a half, more character development could have been inserted, particularly for Freud. In addition, more focus on Jung's relationship with Freud, rather than his relationship with Spielrein, would have been nice to see.Here's hoping that any future collaborations between Cronenberg and Mortensen pack a bit more of a punch."
Forgetting Sarah Marshall,2008,7.1,"Devastated Peter takes a Hawaiian vacation in order to deal with the recent break-up with his TV star girlfriend, Sarah. Little does he know, Sarah's traveling to the same resort as her ex - and she's bringing along her new boyfriend.","I often go see advance screenings in my area, especially now that I must officially be on ""the list"" as I am constantly finding tickets in my work inbox. This was the second Apatow production I've seen in advance and just like ""Superbad"", this did not disappoint. At the same time, while many of the cast members may be recognizable, there seems to be something different about this installment than I've seen in the likes of ""40 Year Old Virgin"", ""Superbad"", or ""Knocked Up"".For starters, there was a definite presence of the ""TV actors on the big screen"" theme here, but I am pleased to report that Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, and Mila Kunis take to movies like naturals. Like many Apatow productions, Segel penned the script and takes over as lead Peter Bretter, proving yet again that with this crew the writer is best suited for the leading role. Segel delivers a character we all know too well from our own personal experiences and never breaks role from the shocking beginning to appropriate ending. I even give Segel extra credit for not completely victimizing his character and pointing out apparent flaws on both ends of the ending relationship.Kristen Bell plays Sarah Marshall, the iconic ex of the film, but her role sits on the back burner along with the truly hilarious Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to make way for a leading role in Mila Kunis. From the beginning it is clear that her not-too-smart and shallow role of ""That 70s Show"" didn't follow her to ""Forgetting""'s script. Kunis plays Racheal, a hospitality girl for the hotel that ""Forgetting"" takes place, and subsequently deals with Peter as he tries to get over Sarah Marshall. Her character is intelligent, charismatic, and appreciative of the good in people, a strong juxtaposition to the seemingly selfish starlet Sarah Marshall. Kunis owns the role with pride, even slipping in gestures and glances that didn't seem to initially be in the script. Hopefully this will open her up for more serious roles than ""American Psycho 2"" and the typecasting that often happens with TV actresses like her.The star of the film, in my opinion, easily has to be Russell Brand, who plays the over-conscious over-sexed rock star Aldous Snow. Snow adds the necessary level of comedy that could have been missing from what is truly a tragic plot. About halfway in the film, I couldn't help but snicker to myself just with the presence that Brand creates (complete with perfect costume choices). The only downfall to a character who is truly the Mercutio of this tragedy is that Brand clearly overshadows Bell's performance as Sarah Marshall, who is ironically the most forgettable character of the film.The writing flows with well-timed jokes, apathetic digs, and shocking vulgar humor. There is even a few moments where you feel Segel was digging on the cast with jokes involving crime dramas (Segel did time on ""CSI"") and TV actresses in horrible horror movies (Kunis did the atrocious ""American Psycho 2""); not sure if it was intentional, but I caught what I thought was a reference. Just as with most Apatow productions, leave the kids at home. Unlike the rest, however, the crude humor doesn't overflow and turn off most audiences (like I noticed with ""Superbad""). It also doesn't get very heavy in the least (which is what I felt hurt ""Knocked Up""). I think Apatow has found a great balance with this production and Segel's script. I also want to give credit to Nicholas Stoller , who proved that he can be successful as a director after the hit he took from helping write ""Fun with Dick and Jane"".All in all, this comedy is just another example of a good time for adults. It keeps a consistently flowing script, unlike many recent comedies that seem to lose pace as they close the story. While crude, the jokes are just light enough to appease most adult audiences and the short 100 minute run time will ensure you won't be glancing at your watch waiting for it to end, just laughing hysterically."
21 Jump Street,2012,7.2,A pair of underachieving cops are sent back to a local high school to blend in and bring down a synthetic drug ring.,"Buddy cop movies have been losing their waves. The thing is that all the buddy cop movies after Rush Hour 1 have been either too dull to comprehend or just mildly interesting and could just pass as a movie you've seen just to mark the register that you've seen it.Based on a TV series of the same name which aired on Fox Network between 1987 and 1991, the series focuses on a squad of youthful-looking undercover police officers investigating crimes in high schools, colleges, and other teenage venues. The 2012 movie adaptation also had the former cast of the series; Johnny Depp and Peter DeLuise play a minor role.Written by Jonah Hill who also starred in it, 21 is a movie that suits a cinema viewing with a box of popcorn at your side. Hill's performance was on a mild okay side, but the main cheese in the movie was Channing Tatum, who transcended from a jock to a nerd and still maintained his persona. I guess the most fun I had was when I saw Ice ‚Äì Cube talking to the duo.The movie was directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs). The directors and writers made sure you didn't have to go see the original to get the full taste of 21, as the film made do of the current pop culture in our time and how ironic and dumb it looks to make a fun movie and enough juice left to make another.21 makes fun of everything in its path, even down to drugs, and how we kept expecting things to blow up and they just don't. The jokes keeps coming in from every corner making you laugh although.The high moments in the movie was whenever the duo were together, the low moment was when they were apart.The plot had the duo Hill and Tatum as Morton Schmidt and Greg Jenko (respectively), get deployed as undercover cops to a high school to bust a drug ring, and everything you'd expect to happen, doesn't. That's the fun of the movie.All in all, why are you wasting time reading this go watch it."
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut",1999,7.7,"When Eric Cartman and his friends go see an R-rated movie, they start cursing and their parents think that Canada is to blame.","In the quiet little town of South Park Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny bride a tramp to sneak them into an R screening of the new Terrance & Phillip movie. They emerge foul mouthed and with attitude as a result of the movie and, while repeating a stunt in the film, Kenny is killed and sent to Hell. Kyle's mother leads a movement against the Canadian comedians that results in their arrest and sentencing to death.  Meanwhile in Hell, Satan and his lover Saddam Hussain prepare for the killing of Terrance & Phillip ¬ñ the sign of the coming of the new time where Satan will rise again to rule the earth.  Can Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny save the comedians, stop the censorship movement that blames society for bad behaviour and prevent Satan and Saddam from destroying the world?I suspect those that hate this movie are generally those who hate the TV show, where those who liked it may not be those who watch the show.  I'm a fan of the show but I not such a fan that I blind to the lack of consistency at times in the show ¬ñ some episodes are dumb and lack wit, trading on swear words and forced jokes.  However I fell in love with this movie from my first time seeing it.  The film is funny in the same sort of silly juvenile way that the series is.  It has the same strange sense of humour ¬ñ witness Conan O'Brien having a `Judas' moment and throwing himself to his death!However on top on this it is imaginative.  How many other crude films would do it as a musical.  I'm not saying that this makes it more worthy than gross out comedies like American Pie etc, but it is cleverer.  The musical element adds to the film and helps it's stretched running time.  The songs are all catchy and are better than some of Lloyd-Webber's stuff!  They are choreographed well and just feel funnier due to the situation and the lyrics!  For example Satan's song `Up there' is excellent but hilarious because of who's singing it and the sentiments he's expressing!The irony of the film is not lost.  The accusations levelled at the South Park Movie are those that the mothers in the film level at Terrance & Phillip.  The story actually answers it's own critics while telling the story!  It's not perfect and it does go a bit over the top and maybe begins to think that it is cleverer than it actually is.The voice work is as excellent as always and Parker and Stone carry this the whole way home.  Guest stars add some interest but really all I need is Cartman et al and I'm set!Overall I am a South park fan and I really enjoyed this.  Not just because of the elements of the show that are reproduced here but also how clever it feels (even if it isn't always as smart as it wants to be).  This isn't a cheap TV spin off into a movie this is a film that is imaginative and funny. Haters of the show will hate this but this may win you over if you thought the TV show was juvenile and a waste of time."
Two Weeks Notice,2002,6.2,"A lawyer decides that she's used too much like a nanny by her boss, so she walks out on him.","Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant hearken back to classic screwball comedies in a very engaging if somewhat shallow romantic film that accentuates laughter above sentiment and succeeds wonderfully - even when it's not especially witty or gut-busting.Bullock plays Lucy Kelson, a committed left-wing attorney with an immaculate Ivy League background who fights the good fight against the heartless developers of lower Manhattan and the outer boroughs. Complications ensue when she finds herself working for one such figure, George Wade (Grant) in exchange for his preserving a Coney Island landmark near her childhood home. Wade's not a bad guy, but he's frightfully dependent on Lucy for everything. When it seems possible she might at last get clear of him, she begins to have second thoughts about letting him go.Two things I really, really like about this movie. One is the chemistry of Grant and Bullock. Bullock takes to being the butt of assorted slapstick with a gusto rare for a gorgeous screen star. She seems to have inherited the Doris Day mantle from Julia Roberts and Meg Ryan, though in a better way than either of those two screen stars. It's a pity she's since shown no interest in maintaining it. Grant plays off her very well in a role he could perform in his sleep - and sometimes seems to do just that, albeit in a good way. He has a casual way with a line that reminds me of Roger Moore or David Niven at their best, and shows he is growing comfortably into a solid on-screen presence after years of coasting on looks and charm. If IMDb.com is correct, he got paid $12.5 million for this, which if true is way too high, but he is probably the one guy who could make Wade so enjoyable, to the point where you're happy at his shenanigans for keeping Lucy by his side.The other thing is the NYC backdrop. There's some eye-popping visuals courtesy of legendary cinematographer Laszlo Kovacs, like the bridges lit up like Christmas trees in the background while Bullock has a drunk moment with Grant aboard his yacht. Another scene features a helicopter shot of Manhattan by the Hudson, with a nice nod at 9/11 that doesn't impose itself on the viewer but is there for the noticing. (This was the first film shot in the city after the tragedy.) You can compare ""Two Weeks Notice"" with classic romantic comedies like ""What's Up Doc?"" or ""Bringing Up Baby."" Not that it's as good, but the goal is similar in that it strives to entertain more than play with one's heartstrings.Alright, the story is shallow. We never really get a sense of Kelson's duties with Wade except when it comes to being pulled out of weddings to pick out ties. Her absentee boyfriend is barely established. The supporting cast is not well developed, except Robert Klein and Dana Ivey as Lucy's parents. (Klein especially is wonderful.) Alicia Witt is spellbindingly gorgeous as Kelton's would-be replacement, and she plays wonderfully off the main pair, but she's suddenly thrust into the role of the heavy simply for plot convenience, and it's jarring. Too many other secondary roles are like that, too.The script, by director Marc Lawrence, has its share of lame one-liners, but it keeps a steady, merry tempo that distracts from the film's shortcomings at least somewhat while focusing on its key strengths, Bullock and Grant. Lawrence's direction is similarly solid. I like the little bits of business between Bullock and Grant, like when they pick off each others' plates at Fraunces Tavern, or when she refuses his offer of a sidewalk kebob, calling it a ""flesh popsicle."" The scene that sticks out most is of her at an outdoor party, wearing a lovely tulle gown and a clown nose. This is one film that makes a serious point of being goofy and glamorous all at once, and it works. If all romantic comedies were so committed to being entertaining, it would be a lot easier for us guys to sit through them."
Mission: Impossible III,2006,6.9,IMF agent Ethan Hunt comes into conflict with a dangerous and sadistic arms dealer who threatens his life and his fianc√©e in response.,"Reviewers say 'Mission: Impossible III' is lauded for its intense action scenes, standout performances by Tom Cruise and Philip Seymour Hoffman, and enhanced direction by J.J. Abrams. However, it faces criticism for its reliance on clich√©s, lack of originality, and excessive action that can detract from the narrative. Some note story inconsistencies and implausibilities. Despite these issues, many find the film enjoyable and a valuable installment in the series."
Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story,2004,6.7,A group of misfits enter a Las Vegas dodgeball tournament in order to save their cherished local gym from the onslaught of a corporate health fitness chain.,"Once every few years, you're presented to a slapstick comedy so hilarious you instantly forget how LOW this form of entertainment actually is. I can't give a scientific explanation to state how come it's funny to see someone (preferably wearing glasses) getting hit in the face by a ball¬Öit just is. Dodgeball is vulgar, crude and without substance¬Öbut your stomach will hurt from laughing and don't we all need that from time to time? In case you really want to defend this film, you can always say it features tons of unsubtle criticism towards modern American image of exaggerated health-obsession. Ben Stiller's character is the personification of the obnoxious fitness guru: 'We're better than you, and we know it'. Opposed to him, there's Vince Vaughn as the chilled-minded, lovable guy who owns a fitness center for the underdeveloped wimps. Due to his financial situation, he risks losing his gym to Stiller except if he and his teams of misfits manage to win the world-famous dodgeball tournament. The film is a series of cheap chuckles, eccentric characters and outrageous one-liners. It's pretty funny to hear Stiller yell out lines like: 'You're a skid mark on the underpants of society'. Or the always-amusing Rip Torn encouraging his team with the words: 'you're as useful as a cock-flavored lollipop'. The acting is great as it can be with Ben Stiller and Rip Torn who go delightfully over the top and lots of enthusiast cameos (Chuck Norris, David Hasselhof, William Shatner and even Lance Armstrong). It sure isn't Schindler's List but Dodgball is great entertainment and stress releasing."
Con Air,1997,6.9,"Former US Amy Ranger, Cameron Poe, has just been paroled for manslaughter, but must stop a group of violent and deadly criminals from escaping the country after they seize control of the prison transport plane he is on.","Con Air is what I've come to expect of a standard Hollywood action flick, nothing more, nothing less. It's got plenty of action, big explosions, one-liners and pure entertainment value. The plot is pretty good, somewhat original, and fairly fast-paced. The acting is good, and the film has a surprisingly large amount of well-known good actors; Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, Danny Trejo, Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames and John Malkovich. They all give good performances, as do most of the supporting actors. The characters are well-written and credible. I found it interesting how most of the characters aren't all black or white in their actions and personalities; many of them have a shade of gray or two. The action is well-done, exciting and intense. The special effects(the few there are) are good enough. The ending may be a little extreme, but it's a good climax, and the good things in the film make up for the bad; granted, there are a few downright lame parts, but there are far more good parts than bad. All in all, everything you'd expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer action film, and nothing else. I recommend it to fans of standard action films. 7/10"
The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,2008,5.2,"In the Far East, Alex O'Connell, the son of famed mummy fighters Rick and Evy O'Connell, unearths the mummy of the first Emperor of Qin -- a shape-shifting entity cursed by a witch centuries ago.","I almost didn't see this in the theater due to all the bad reviews. What changed my mind was Roger Ebert giving it a rare positive review. Since I agree with Ebert more than most critics, I decided to go see it.I have to say that none of the reviews or comments I've read tell the whole picture, IMHO. Neither Ebert's praise nor other critics' pans are entirely appropriate. Lets' start with the basics... ""The Mummy"" was a modern retelling of a 30's ""B"" monster movie with up to date FX. It wasn't great drama, but it was a rousing thrill ride that capably did its job of entertaining you if you weren't too picky about plot, etc. The two sequels have continued this tradition. I'd rate this as inferior to the original but slightly superior to ""The Mummy Returns"".Much has been made about the casting of Maria Bello in the role originated by Rachel Weisz. While I'm not a Rachel Weisz fanboy, she is a very capable actress and I just don't believe Ms. Bello was up to the role. There is simply no chemistry between Bello and Brendan Fraser. There are basically only two legitimate reasons to make a sequel: 1) either there are loose ends to tie up, or 2) people really like the characters and want to see more of them. Each film in the Mummy franchise ties up its own loose ends, so the producers are risking commercial suicide to change the characters in any significant way. If they couldn't get Rachel Weisz, they should have been much more careful in recasting the role. There's very little physical resemblance between the two actresses, and Ms. Bello simply doesn't seem to have the acting chops to carry it off. That unfortunate casting choice casts a pall over the whole enterprise - but not enough to sink it.Some have criticized the film because they don't believe that Brendan Fraser looks old enough to have a son Luke Ford's age. That's arguable (all of the holdover cast is starting to show their age - especially John Hannah) but, again, it's not a deal-breaker.OTOH, the secondary roles are excellent. Michelle Yeoh and Isabella Leong are excellent while Jet Li gives another great performance as the evil emperor. Luke Ford is somewhat bland, though, and doesn't appear to be a good candidate to carry the franchise into the future.The CGI FX are generally excellent but nothing we haven't seen in the first two films. The exception to this are the yetis! With only a few minutes of screen time, they pretty much steal every scene they're in. Where the FX do seem lacking is in imagination, scale, and scope when compared to the previous two films. Perhaps that's because more of the action in the previous films took place in dark, claustrophobic settings, while here many of them are in brightly lit sunlight. The battle scenes in particular suffer in the inevitable comparison to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.Was this film made principally to milk the franchise? Almost certainly, but then so was ""The Mummy Returns"". But that doesn't mean it fails on its own terms. It is entertaining and supplies much of the same appeal as its predecessors. If you can watch it on those terms and if Maria Bello's casting isn't too disappointing to you, then go see it - you may have a good time. I did."
Pretty Woman,1990,7.1,"A corporate raider hires a hooker to act as a business escort in Beverly Hills, California.","""the bad stuff is easier to believe. you ever notice that?"" - vivianok, so pretty woman is a romantic movie, its cliched, its corny, its sappy. but hey, beyond all that is a special movie with some very special performances. julia roberts as vivian ward is absolutely adorable, one of the most lovable characters of alltime. and those long legs help - like she says - "" 88"" of therapy for the bargain price of $3000""the movie has many memorable lines and if you fall in love with the movie you will go back to it again and again. this is easily the best romantic comedy movie of the 90s. though many movies have hence tried to recreate its charm, nothing has quite succeeded to replace this movie as the pinnacle of the genre.and this ofcourse is high praise from someone who hates the genre. the story ofcourse is very predictable and cinderella like. however this is beautifully told and the on-screen chemistry between the very dashing richard gere and julia roberts is simply sensational. an absolute must for fans of romance, comedy, any kind of light hearted movies or for those who are big fans of julia or richard. watch this movie.an enjoyable 8!"
Cosmopolis,2012,5.1,A 28-year-old billionaire senses his empire collapsing around him.,"Let's say that for every 10 ""Twilight"" fans, at least one is guaranteed to give ""Cosmopolis"" a go for no other reason than Robert Pattinson. And among those ""Twilight"" fans dumb enough to mindlessly try the film out, at least 9 of 10 will despise what they see.David Cronenberg rather faithfully (from what I understand) adapts Don DeLillo's socio- economic commentary rolled into a film about young billionaire Eric Packer, who goes on a long limo ride across New York City for a haircut. What he fails to recognize, however, is that he was completely wasting his time; ""Cosmopolis"" has no business being a movie.Cronenberg's clean and tight approach to the film can't be denied its technical kudos, but everything he films is emotionally anemic. ""Cosmopolis"" has no story; its characters are talking heads and its scenes just a collection of political gospel and esoteric ideologies.Not an ounce of this film goes into giving its characters souls, and the more you hunt in search for just a sliver of one, the less attention you pay to the themes so fundamental to the film's core. If you can focus long enough in any given scene, you'll pick up some thought- provoking nuggets, but our natural curiosity as an audience is to look for the story behind the highbrow dialogue. Doing so, however, distracts from paying attention to all that can be praised about this material.Therein lies the reason Cronenberg should have left the novel alone. Ideas like the ones presented in ""Cosmopolis"" deserve time to simmer. If I had read the book, I certainly would have taken the time to re-read portions of it to process the commentary on capitalism rather than thinking at multiple times throughout the film ""oh, there are rats, that's a symbol for what this film is trying to say about capitalism!""With the exception of Packer's newly made wife (Sarah Gadon), the cast of supporting characters suffers a similar fate in spite of some big names in Juliette Binoche, Paul Giamatti and Jay Baruchel. By the time you can begin to so much as chew on the ideas raised in one of any of the several scenes in which Packer meets with a new character in his limo and talks about big-time stuff, that character is gone from the film completely. You never get a moment to catch up so that you can be in step with what's going on.Providing further distraction from understanding anything that's said in this movie is how Cronenberg ‚Äî as he always does ‚Äî charges this film with sexual and violent tension. He's not adding any that's not already in the story, but he accentuates it. Consequently, moments in the film will yank you out of your perpetual state of philosophical processing and snap you back into the moment of the film, usually a violent outburst or a quick cut to a sex scene. That's part of what makes Cronenberg a revered director, but in this case it's what makes ""Cosmopolis"" such a tough watch.For those hoping to see what Pattinson does as a top-billed star given weighty material, ""Cosmopolis"" proves to be an unfair judge. He seems comfortable with the bizarre style of dialogue, but the character and the story are so empty that the film can hardly be considered a fair judgment of his would-be dramatic prowess.As with any work of art steeped in its ideas, the more you sit with it or re-experience it, the more you're likely to warm up to it, and I have no reason to believe that will not be true of ""Cosmopolis."" At the same time, a majority of viewers will likely not be equipped with the experience of processing this language as the film necessitates, and the first run-through (obviously the most important) suffers drastically as a result.~Steven CThanks for reading!

The Little Mermaid,1989,7.6,A mermaid princess makes a Faustian bargain in an attempt to become human and win a prince's love.,"The Little Mermaid is one of those films I grew up with when I was a kid - something that the whole family can watch and never really get sick of. The imagination brought into this fairy tale (despite the fact that the ending is vastly changed from the original to please the kids) is simply superb. Songs, music, characters are all terrific.While I think Beauty and the Beast stands as Disney's best animated film, The Little Mermaid is still one of the top ones to check out. A story about Aeriel - the young mermaid curious about the human world who ends up falling for Prince Eric of the human race.And all the other cute characters such as Sebastian, Flounder, not to mention a very sinister villain with the Sea Witch. It all makes for a great time and has a good deal of emotion in it too.I really miss Disney films made in this era - they were done so well and I will always be a huge fan of them. The ones nowadays - while they aren't horrible, just seem to be a bit too modern and hence don't have that magic as the old ones - probably because they focus more on doing references to other things rather than coming up with original ideas that felt fresh."
Red 2,2013,6.6,Retired CIA agent Frank Moses reunites his unlikely team of elite operatives for a global quest to track down a missing portable nuclear device.,"This was a very enjoyable film. The story continues with the retired - and more dangerous than anybody else - agents. Frank and his comrades find themselves treading all over the globe and finding conflict at each stop.If you haven't seen the first film, you can still enjoy this piece. You won't understand all of the relationships immediately, but the story stands on its own. And it does a very good job at that.The movie was so much fun. It had clever and well-thought out jokes throughout the film. The jokes kept coming and were very skillfully timed.The action was thrilling. Along with the jokes, non-stop action to get your blood pumping filled this film. They kept the same feel of cool, unreasonable stunts and explosions from the first movie, but they also added a lot more hand-to-hand combat, which was still very amusing to watch and excellently choreographed.The acting was great and the story was well-written with actual twists. The soundtrack and sound effects made all the guns and explosions that much more convincing and enjoyable.This film had a much higher body count than the last one, but still managed to keep it pretty light-hearted. If you liked the first one, this film will not disappoint. If you haven't seen the first one it's still very entertaining to watch."
Megamind,2010,7.3,"Evil genius Megamind finally defeats his do-gooder nemesis, Metro Man, but is left without a purpose in a superhero-free world.","A faultless and incredibly charismatic little superhero film, Megamind may stand on the shoulders of other superhero flicks before its time, but it also provides such unique and creative differences that raise the bar higher than ever before. I have been a fan of Dreamworks Animation for a long time, I grew up watching it, and I always would prefer it to Disney flicks and other animated adventures that would come out throughout the years. Megamind is easily one of my favorite, and one of their most underrated films to date. Yes it relies on the Clark Kent vs Lex Luthor type of formula, as really most superhero films do, but it took a chance with its ambitious ideas and made it work so well, you can't help but forgive it. The film was largely overshadowed at the time by its animated competeter, Despicable Me which was a delightful surprise, but in my opinion no where near as close as smart and funny as this film. The film has such a great character with Megamind, who isn't just a bad guy, but someone who turns to bad to find a purpose- to feel fit in the world around him, even if it means being feared. The animation is fantastic and the voice work is tremendously on point, Will Ferrell (as he does with so many of his characters) brings so much life to Megamind- in a performance you will truly never forget. The soundtrack is fabulously done by veteran composer Hans Zimmer, and the script is incredibly sharp, with so many moments looking back upon that were truly ahead of its time. In the end, I feel we don't deserve a film like Megamind, but neverless we got it and it came with flair to spare. I love this film, and I encourage anyone who doubted its genius, to give it another try.My Rating: 10/10."
A Bug's Life,1998,7.2,"A misfit ant, looking for ""warriors"" to save his colony from greedy grasshoppers, recruits a group of bugs that turn out to be an inept circus troupe.","I thought this was the most sophisticated animation I have ever seen, 2-D or 3-D.  The bird attack and the rain storm scenes were unbelievable.  The bloopers were a riot!But again Hollywood pumps out a high-gloss, low-impact movie.  For all its beauty, it was a pretty ho-hum story.  They could have really played up the Seven Samurai angle by offering a more in-depth, poignant view of the life of these oppressed ants.  Perhaps tugged on the heart-strings a little more. I found myself almost rooting for the grasshoppers against these simple, whining ants.  A little more character development could have made this the greatest animated feature of all time."
Blade: Trinity,2004,5.8,"Blade, now a wanted man by the FBI, must join forces with the Nightstalkers to face his most challenging enemy yet: Dracula.","I usually don't like sequels, and I most often hate when they do a third movie. Well for some odd reason I really enjoy watching the blade movies. The first Blade is of course the best by far, but I still enjoy the two sequels. There were some things that annoyed me about Blade: Trinity, and that was how the action sequences was shot. Very up and close, with fast cutting so you really can't see what is being done. Old Hollywood trick when the actor or actress doesn't know martial arts but we are meant to think that he/she does. But if you take away that fact, you still have about two hours with action, one liners and people too cool for their own good. This is Blade ladies and gentlemen, and you know he will get the job done while saying cheesy lines and killing bad guys off one by one. If you go to see this movie, keep an open mind because if you want a good movie you will be disappointed. If you on the other hand want to be easily entertained without having to think about plot holes and bad lines, you will be glad you went. I rate this movie 6/10"
The Jungle Book,1967,7.6,Bagheera the Panther and Baloo the Bear have a difficult time trying to convince a boy to leave the jungle for human civilization.,"It isn't completely faithful to the book, but for a good reason. The book has bits that you can't have in an animation. The animation is beautiful, the backgrounds rich in colour, and the characters beautifully drawn. The story is a very simple one, yet effective, and allows the songs and characters to take force. The songs and music by the Sherman Brothers perfectly match the breeziness of the film, with classics such as "" Bare Neccessities"" and ""Wanna Be like you"". Unlike some people, I liked the vulture barbershop, excellent harmonies. And what a talented voice-cast. Phil Harris was hilarious as Baloo, and Sebastian Cabot was brooding as Bagheera. Reitherman's son was good as Mowgli, and Louis Prima(who's not black so the racist overtones idea is ridiculous) was a riot as Louis. The real star was the perfectly cast George Sanders as the frightening and calculating Shere Khan. This is fantastic, if a little short, and avoid the sequel! 9/10 Bethany Cox"
The Waterboy,1998,6.2,A waterboy for a college football team discovers he has a unique tackling ability and becomes a member of the team.,"I really liked the Waterboy.  It was crude, raw, and utterly funny.  Adam Sandler gives his funniest yet since his 1995 cult hit Billy Madison.  In this feel good movie, Sandler plays a dumb waterboy who gets on a football team and becomes a damn good tackler.  Everything in this film is funny, from beginning to end.  Henry Winkler has his best in years as a down on his luck coach and Kathy Bates is Dead Pan funny as mama.  Great all around. A+"
Resident Evil: Extinction,2007,6.2,"Survivors of the Raccoon City catastrophe travel across the Nevada desert, hoping to make it to Alaska. Alice joins the caravan and their fight against the evil Umbrella Corp.","The deadly virus has decimated the world, exception a little zone in Alaska where live people no-infected . Years later , one time Racoon was destroyed , the Umbrella corporation led by ambitious Dr. Isaacs(Iain Glen) continues his weird experiments with the deadly T-virus. But the Zombies spread the epidemic and those exposed to cruel bite suffer a complete transformation turning into meat-eating sickos. Alice(Milla Jovovich)is attempting to survive , and she finds new survivors(Ali Larter, Ashanti along with Oded Fehr and Mike Epps who repeat characters) traveling throughout Nevada desert . They must confront carnivorous crows, hordes of zombies starving of human flesh and an evil corporation chief who creates the most horrifying creatures ever made .The survivor group are surrounded , facing the world destruction by deadly epidemic.This exciting picture contains thrills, chills, action-filled with fierce combats and lots of gore and guts.The horror and action moments are fast moving and compactly realized. The film turns out to be a crossover between 'the nuclear apocalypse of Mad Max 2', the 'George A Romero's Zombies' and genetic experiments from 'Sigourney Wever-Ripley in Alien saga '. Of course, the film takes ideas from former parts as 'Resident evil'(2002, Paul W. Anderson, here also producer and screenwriter) and 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse'(2004,Alexander Witt)resulting to be a nice following. The creepy images of wide range from the genuinely fantastic to the bizarre along with an eerie and amazing frames. It's predictable but we have seen the previous chapters but also its predictability is redeemed in part by the charismatic acting from the action-women, Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter. The flesh-eating mutants appearance deliver the goods, plenty of screams, shocks and tension. The make-up assistants create a truly horrible zombie cannibals. Horrifying and astonishing images about apocalyptic events with deserted and destroyed cities, such as the creepy scenarios in Las Vegas without people, totally uninhabited and covered of sand. Cool,luminous cinematography using steadicam by David Johnson and haunting musical score by Charles Clouser.The motion picture is surprisingly directed with startling visual style by Russell Mulcahy(Razorback,Highlander, Resurrection)."
Mission: Impossible II,2000,6.1,"IMF agent Ethan Hunt is sent to Sydney to find and destroy a genetically modified disease called ""Chimera"".","Reviewers say 'Mission: Impossible II' is an action-packed sequel with impressive stunts and sequences, though it often deviates from the cerebral suspense of the original. The film's shift towards high-octane action, use of slow-motion, and exaggerated stunts are common themes. Director John Woo's style is noted, but criticisms include a thin plot, lack of character development, and over-reliance on action. Despite these issues, many appreciate the entertainment value and thrilling action scenes, though some find it inferior to the first installment."
Company of Heroes,,5.0,"American soldiers lost behind enemy lines during World War II make a horrific discovery: Hitler has a super bomb in development. Against all odds, they set out to find the scientist in charge of the program who is looking to defect.","I watched the movie with my uncle, an infantry veteran who was a radioman during the Battle of the Bulge in the area the movie depicts. He was excited to see his unit's insignia, Indian head on a Star, and looked forward to the action. He came away disappointed. The story is fictional as explained in small print in a disclaimer by SONY in the rolling credits after the movie. The attention to detail was appreciated but missed a lot. He said tommy guns were a rarity to the infantryman. Eight shot M-1 was standard issue. The ease with which the enemy positions were penetrated was impossible. The weather conditions were brutal, not spring-like with melting snow and puddles on water. Troops sitting around with open jackets; really? No, in reality, the ground was so frozen, you couldn't dig a hole to hide from the incoming artillery! So, if you are looking for a Band of Brothers type of movie or Saving Private Ryan, you won't get it here. I am not totally dissing it; I appreciate the effort put into it. But it could have been so much better. The big question is ""why not look for a plot based on factual context?"" It is out there and other directors have had success with it."
The Color of Money,1986,7.0,"Fast Eddie Felson teaches a cocky but immensely talented prot√©g√© the ropes of pool hustling, which in turn inspires him to make an unlikely comeback.","People misunderstood ""The Color of Money,"" I think. There are a few things to keep in mind:1) This was a Martin Scorsese film. Scorsese was fresh off ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull,"" and other such successes from less than a decade before. People were expecting a lot.2) It starred Paul Newman, returning to his character from ""The Hustler,"" in a sequel that was twenty-five years in the making. That's longer than the wait for the ""Phantom Menace"" prequel.Perhaps for those two (very strong) reasons alone, when ""The Color of Money"" opened in 1986, the critics and audiences didn't think much of it. It garnered decent praise from both areas but most critics seemed to agree: it didn't hold a candle to ""The Hustler,"" and anyone other than Scorsese could have easily made the same picture.After 19 years, I disagree. I think ""The Color of Money"" is not only an intelligent and amusing character piece, but an excellent continuation of a character we haven't seen for 25 years.First of all, Scorsese's direction isn't his best, but it's still very good. And he's definitely got the same elements going on as ""After Hours"" from a few years before -- his cinematography is identical and the dark colors and grainy '80s vibe are present in every frame. Likewise he's using the quick-cuts and zooms and iconic panning shots that he's known for. The thing is, Scorsese's styles just changed a bit during the 1980s (they even carried on into ""GoodFellas"" -- the night-time shots carry the same foreboding look as ""After Hours"" and ""Color of Money""). I think now, looking back, since we've seen more of Scorsese's films, it's easier to notice that this is indeed a Martin Scorsese film. A man who is constantly changing his directorial approach. (Just look at ""The Aviator"" for goodness sake!) Newman deserved the Oscar more for ""The Hustler,"" of course, but for what it's worth, Fast Eddie Felson's evolution is handled with care in the script and it's very entertaining (for anyone who's seen the original) to note the change in his behavior. It's also interesting to see the new cocky pool hustler, Vince (Tom Cruise), filling in the shoes of Eddie from a few decades before.If ""The Hustler"" was a great insight into the life of a troubled young man, then ""The Color of Money"" is a terrific insight into the evolution of this man, and the contrast between the young and the old. All adults tell us as children that they were just like us at one time, and we don't believe them. ""The Color of Money"" follows this principal -- in thirty years, we all know Vince will be just like Fast Eddie: wise and matured. And then he'll probably be coaching a young guy who thinks he's the king of the world. Will they make another sequel based on this continuation of the story? I doubt it. It's unnecessary, because as far as I'm concerned ""The Color of Money"" has already stressed the point. But you never know...Overall this isn't a great movie and I won't pretend it is. But I do think it's one of the better films to come out of the 1980s and had a lot more going for it than some of the critics gave it credit for. Film buffs should see it, especially those who loved ""The Hustler."""
The Age of Innocence,1993,7.2,"A tale of nineteenth-century New York high society in which a young lawyer falls in love with a woman separated from her husband, while he is engaged to the woman's cousin.","I really liked this movie because it was so rich in every aspect: from the acting, to the setting and the costumes, the cinematography and the score, everything was beautifully crafted. The movie seems to start slowly and the story is only relatively important. More than anything it is an occasion for Scorsese to talk about the NY upper society of the late 1800, and it's rigid way, sometimes desperate (see Ryder's character), often cruel to maintain an identity (paradoxically built on the European upper class mold) despite the changes that were happening. I was very impressed by the use of the objects, the clothes of the time to describe the feeling of the scene or of the characters involved.The actors are all very good, but Michelle Pfeiffer really delivers and excellent performance. Also Winona Ryder's character is well portrayed and towards the end of the movie, the actress is able to convincingly show how her character is much more layered than what it seems to be in the beginning of the story.In my opinion this movie deserves 8"
Machete,2010,6.6,"After being set-up and betrayed by the man who hired him to assassinate a Texas Senator, an ex-Federale launches a brutal rampage of revenge against his former boss.","Machete is one of the funnest movies I've ever seen. Right from the beginning you know this movie doesn't take itself seriously. It's essentially a live-action cartoon with A-list actors. You have Danny Trejo - the antithesis of a leading man - carrying the movie as Machete, the unkillable badass Mexican James Bond. If you want to talk plot, this is basically a revenge story. Steven Seagal kills his family, then years later Machete gets caught up in a political scandal where Robert De Niro is playing a cross between George Bush and Donald Trump, and somehow Seagal's character is pulling the strings. It's as amazing as it sounds. Then you have Don Johnson as the head of border patrol or something, mowing down Mexicans all over the place, and Jeff Fahey as one of Seagal's enforcers in Texas. Now you may be thinking, ""Four villains? This sounds more convoluted than Spiderman 3!"" And you'd have a point if this was a traditional action movie, but it's not. At all. It's a comedy more than anything with some ridiculous action sequences and gratuitous T&A all over the place. These characters just serve to forward the plot, and to give us some belly laughs, and somehow it all works beautifully.Jessica Alba is one of the officers assigned to this scandal. Michelle Rodriguez serves as the leader of a Mexican resistance, oh and there's Lindsey Lohan playing Jeff Fahey's ""religious"" daughter. There are so many characters and somehow they all fit the movie perfectly. All of the acting is great (well, Alba is never ""great"" but she serves her purpose and she's as hot as a supernova so who cares). But you can buy Robert De Niro as a corrupt senator, Don Johnson as this racist megalomaniac, Fahey as this hard-ass enforcer, and Seagal as a Mexican drug lord. Yeah. And the best part is they're all having a blast. It's pure mayhem going on, and you're not bored for a second. Danny Trejo as the title character deserves much props though. He just looks like a guy who would have a wide array of knives stashed under his vest, and the guy is making out with some of the hottest women on the planet. It's the role of a lifetime.Robert Rodriguez is amazing for making this an actual movie, and the cast are amazing for agreeing to be part of this project. It's so, so, SO entertaining. It's damn near impossible to sit through this movie with a straight face. I had a big fat grin throughout the whole thing. If you like silly action movies with fantastic actors and a surprisingly good plot, then look no further than Machete."
I Am Number Four,2011,6.1,"Aliens and their Guardians are hiding on Earth from intergalactic bounty hunters. They can only be killed in numerical order, and Number Four is next on the list. This is his story.","Do you know that old movie rule that you subconsciously decide whether you're going to enjoy a film or not within the first ten minutes? Well, it wasn't true this time, because after the opening sequence, I was pretty sure I was going to hate ""I Am Number Four"". Thankfully, I was in for a pleasant surprise.It all starts with bad CGI-monsters and some guys in Star Trek make-up chasing people around in the jungle. We then cut to some jocks doing tricks on jet skis and some bland blonde girls admiring them - and I thought this is going to be terrible. Then the story picks up and the movie gets better from there.The story involves a couple of characters and mysteries, but is never too complicated. After the initial jet ski scene, the main character actually turns out to be played quite charmingly by Alex Pettyfer. He's supported by his mentor/protector (solid as always: Timothy Olyphant). Glee's Dianna Agron plays Number Four's love interest. She comes across very natural, so that the love story that unfolds is actually engaging instead of vomit-inducing like that of that other movie with the whining Vampires and the shirtless Werewolves.Of course, ""I Am Number Four"" is by no means a great movie. The CGI sucks in places and the make-up of the bad guys is just awful. Characters are stereotypical, things fall into place way too conveniently and one has the feeling that a good junk of the original novel has just been crammed together to (barely) fit into the running time of a popcorn movie.However, I think we can all agree that it would be silly to actually expect a masterpiece, considering the movie's premise. For what it is, ""I Am Number Four"" is an entertaining little fantasy flick for teenagers and undemanding twenty-somethings. Add to that the fact that this movie is neither a sequel nor a remake, that it's not based on a comic book, a TV series, a computer game or toys, and it's enough to lift ""I Am Number Four"" heads and shoulders above its genre competitors."
Machete Kills,2013,5.6,The U.S. government recruits Machete to battle his way through Mexico in order to take down an arms dealer who looks to launch a weapon into space.,"First came ""Grindhouse"" (2007), a critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful ode to exploitation films of the 1970's & 1980's. Then came ""Machete"" (2010), an unapologetically violent spin off adapted by popular demand from one of the fake trailers that accompanied ""Grindhouse"".Unlike ""Grindhouse"", ""Machete"" was a commercial success, making 2 1/2 times its money back in domestic grosses alone. Inevitably, there would be a sequel. Because of how much I enjoyed ""Machete"", I was looking forward to ""Machete Kills"" (2013).Unfortunately, while the movie's predecessors were aware that they were both parodying and paying tribute to low budget schlock flicks, ""Machete Kills"" somehow forgets that fact. The over-the-top violence and sex is still there, but something still did not feel right as I was watching this film.The movie starts out right as you get an allegedly fake trailer for ""Machete Kills Again . . . In Space"". In this ""preview"" (which may or may not actually get made in the near future), the film is grainy, scientifically unrealistic, and primarily fun to watch.Then the movie begins, and the film is as clear as crystal, the first indication that the director, Robert Rodriguez, somehow forgot what he was parodying. Based on the casting of supporting characters, Rodriguez may have also intended ""Machete Kills"" more as a second chance for once-prominent actors with now-notorious reputations than a tongue-in-cheek tribute to his love for fun, low-budget cinema.The original ""Machete"" was no masterpiece, but it was enjoyable to watch because Danny Trejo played an appealing bad-ass, and the narrative was solid. In ""Machete Kills"", Danny Trejo somehow doesn't seem to be into the character he made his own, keeping the same inexpressive face throughout as if he is already bored with playing the character.The story in this movie is also too simplified and hackneyed to accommodate as many supporting characters as it does. There's a terrorist who is about to launch a nuclear missile from Mexico to Washington, D.C., and is one of those villains who doesn't know what he wants to do with the world once he takes it over.While Trejo, Michelle Rodriguez, and others from the original movie make welcome returns to this sequel, so many characters are added to this story that their presence actually makes the story more confusing. There's a Miss Texas beauty pageant contestant (Amber Heard) who serves as both a femme fatale and almost an Agent Q to Machete, a brothel owner (Sofia Vergara) with an uninspired bra gun which has been done in countless movies and TV shows before, and a lone assassin who assumes many identities (including Lady Gaga) who wants to kill Machete for reasons the film doesn't seem to explain.If you're going to accommodate that many characters, write a story where every character has more of a useful goal than ""Kill the hero"", or even ""Make a clever cameo"". While I thought it was clever to have Charlie Sheen be credited as Carlos Estevez (his birth name) in the beginning sequence, he served no purpose playing the President of the United States.It's as if the screenwriters just said, ""Hey, you know what would be funny? Let's have a formerly legitimate actor whose life is a train wreck play the President!"" Sure, Sheen smokes, womanizes, and swears in his role, but those actions alone don't elicit more than a chuckle.On the other hand, I bought into Mel Gibson playing Voz, the villainous operator of a weapons manufacturer who made the nuclear missile. Does Gibson's presence here show how fall the former A-lister has fallen? Maybe, but he still sold every line he spoke, and still showed his good acting days are not behind him.As for the gratuitous violence, I was hoping for more irony in what I was watching. Machete doesn't seem to have more creative ways to use a large knife beside slashing it from right to left. Plus, any creative ways a nemesis dies seems to be ripped right from ""The Itchy & Scratchy Show"" cartoon on ""The Simpsons"".If Robert Rodriguez decides to go ahead and make ""Machete Kills Again . . . In Space"", he needs to make sure there's enough room in the story for any celebrities whose careers he wants to revitalize. Plus, he needs to embrace the graininess of fun B-movies, and remember that even schlock fails without a coherent story.Probably foremost, he also needs to make sure Danny Trejo actually wants to reprise his role, because you got no indication of that desire here. Or, even better, give Michelle Rodriguez her own spin off as Luz, the Mexican revolutionary. Unlike Trejo, she actually seemed like she wanted to be there."
Desperado,1995,7.1,Former musician and gunslinger El Mariachi arrives at a small Mexican border town after being away for a long time. His past quickly catches up with him and he soon gets entangled with the local drug kingpin Bucho and his gang.,"There are so many adjectives one could use describing this film, I wouldn't know where to begin to start. I'll just try to limit them to a few. The headline here states one of them. Others could be ""ludicrous,"" ""fun,"" ""amusing,"" ""stupid,"" etc. You get the idea.Robert Rodriguez took the profits from his first film, ""El Mariachi,"" and continued on with the story now with more funds, so he made it glossier, more explosive, added some name actors and, of course, way overdid it, making it almost a cartoon it is so outrageous. He continued this with the third film, ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"" which is even more of the same.If something worked subtly the first time, filmmakers think that to improve on it is by bombarding the audience with it the next time. They don't know when enough is enough and, boy, does that apply to Rodriguez. He does keep you entertained, though, once you check your brains at the door and begin watching the show. However, all this excess makes it lose any credibility ""El Mariachi"" might have built up with the first show in this trilogy.Whether the movie is really dumb or its just tongue-in-cheek humor by Rodriguez, it has super-style and fun to watch. Talk about stylish! No wonder Quentin Tarantino and he are good friends and the latter has a guest appearance in the film. They both love having fun with the cameras.The first eight minutes let you know what you are in for: outrageousness. It's an 8-minute scene at a bar involving a story told by Steve Buscemi. It's one of the highlights of the movie.Antonio Bandaras and Selyma Hayek are the ""good guys"" but they aren't exactly Billy Graham and Mother Teresa. If they are the good guys, you can imagine how evil the ""bad guys"" are? Speaking of them, two of the toughest- looking hombres in the business are chief among the villains: Joaquim de Almeida and Danny Trejo.Some of the action scenes are so outrageous you laugh out loud. My favorite was a guy shooting rockets out of his guitar case! As that tells you, it's just a wild ride: 103 minutes of south-of-the-border Rodriguez-Tarantino lunacy and despite what may sound like a bunch of insults, I always have fun watching this movie."
From Dusk Till Dawn,1996,7.2,"Two criminals and their hostages unknowingly seek temporary refuge in a truck stop populated by vampires, with chaotic results.","I loved this film for many reasons. For one, the switch from a crime thriller to a horror thriller was seamless. I for one had not heard much about this film before I watched it, and I assumed the TV Times were mistaken in called this a gory horror thriller. To me, it was a simple crime thriller, the norm which is expected from Tarantino's pen. However, the switch was such a shock and so fast, that I didn't now what happened I was amazed at this revelation, since there was no word of any horror topics beforehand in the script. It was completely out of the blue, and resulted in a pleasant surprise.And the thing that's interesting is that BOTH halves to this film, both the crime section and horror section are enjoyable. The first half has less action, but tension does mount between Keitel and Clooney, while Tarantino is in the back, paying special attention to Keitel's daughter. A great premise with an equally great script in the first half. The second section is also great because of the horrific violence and as I heard mentioned before, the unique ways on how to kill vampires.The script is witty and full of dark humour, ""I have 6 little friends and they all run faster than you."", and the intro is certainly one of the best I have seen in months. The characters are well established, with Clooney as the 'gentleman' (well, not really) crook, Tarantino as his psychotic brother (who, strangely, I found difficult not to warm to) and Keitel is the preacher who has lost his faith, the hostage who will help out later when the satanic hordes unleash themselves.A special mention must go to Salma Hayek for that special dance. ;) While this film was never made out of blockbuster material, it is still very understated, taking a unique and perhaps surreal viewing on the horror genre, all the while using horror stereotypes. As far as graphic violence is concerned, it is on par with the likes of Evil Dead (well, perhaps not THAT bad).For once, this is a film which doesn't give the viewer all the answers beforehand. You are in the same boat as the characters and you don't know what's in store for them. If you hadn't seen this before, without any knowledge of the movie, you'd be in for a huge surprise as I was.An 8/10 for it's script (thanks to Tarantino) and the actors who, while not trying too hard, make this an enjoyable horror flick with a difference."
Cheers,,8.0,"The regulars of the Boston bar ""Cheers"" share their experiences and lives with each other while drinking or working at the bar where everybody knows your name.","Not only was this show good enough to run a full eleven seasons, but, over twenty years after the last episode, it still holds up! The topics are still relevant, the dialogue is still funny, and you can still see real-life versions of these scenarios play out in your local favorite watering hole. I've already called out a few Cliff Clavins!Whereas most shows that start out hot eventually lose their steam and fizzle out, this series changed characters, tweaked plot lines, and kept just enough of its essence true to execute a strong run throughout (I think the show got better when Woody came aboard!). I normally hate sitcoms, but this is one of the best ones I've ever watched. Queue up the complete series on Netflix, and watch every last episode.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out www.livemancave.com"
The Fifth Element,1997,7.6,"In the colorful future, a cab driver unwittingly becomes the central figure in the search for a legendary cosmic weapon to keep Evil and Mr. Zorg at bay.","The Fifth Element is another fine example of the filmmaking talents of Luc Besson. Luc Besson, a creative genius and the director of classic films such as The Big Blue, Nikita and Leon (The Professional) has returned to the genre that started his filmmaking career, sci-fi. In The Fifth Element Luc Besson realises his life long ambition to make a film based on a story he thought of while still at school, Zaltman Bleros. Writing and directing the film, he skillfully mixes humour with action and amazing visual effects that put The Fifth Element in a class of it's own. Stunning performances are put forward by Milla Jovovich, Bruce Willis, Ian Holm, Chris Tucker and Gary Oldman, who returns to work with Luc Besson after playing Norman Stansfield in Leon. The Fifth Element show us how well comedy, action and romance can be put together. Overlooked at the Academy Awards, Luc Besson won the Cesar for Best Director at Cannes in 1998 for The Fifth Element. Simply, an excellent film, 10/10."
The Devil's Advocate,1997,7.5,An exceptionally adept Florida lawyer is offered a job at a high-end New York City law firm with a high-end boss - the biggest opportunity of his career to date.,"Of course I have seen the 1997 movie ""The Devil's Advocate"" before. But truth be told, I needed no persuasion to sit down and watch the movie again here in 2024, as I had the opportunity to do so.Writers Andrew Neiderman, Jonathan Lemkin and Tony Gilroy put together quite an enjoyable and entertaining script and storyline. It is a narrative that is parts drama, thriller and mystery, which actually played out quite nicely. And there is something unique about the storyline which makes the movie watchable again and again.The movie has a very impressive cast ensemble, with some pretty good talents. You know what you are getting into when you have the likes of Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino in the leading roles, and they do deliver here; especially Al Pacino, he was phenomenal in the role of John Milton. The movie also have the likes of Charlize Theron, Jeffrey Jones, Judith Ivey, Connie Nielsen and Craig T. Nelson on the cast list, among many other great talents.""The Devil's Advocate"" has a few special effects throughout the 144 minutes that it runs for, which helps promote the narrative quite nicely. It is not a movie that relies heavily on special effects to tell its tale, nor does it rely on special effects to be an effective movie. Instead, director Taylor Hackford makes usage of carnal situations to cement the elements of pleasure and lust that drives John Milton and his surroundings.I will say that ""The Devil's Advocate"" is the type of movie that you just have to watch, because it definitely was one of the more memorable and defining movies of the late 1990s. And it is quite an entertaining storyline in the movie.My rating of ""The Devil's Advocate"" lands on a seven out of ten stars."
Blade,1998,7.1,"A half-vampire, half-mortal man becomes a protector of the mortal race, while slaying evil vampires.","I didn't see this movie until it appeared on television because I was doubtful about comic flicks. Ever since the ""Batman"" series, ""Spawn,"" ""Judge Dredd,"" and many other pitiful p.g.-13 bombs, I dodged everything at all cost. I would question in my mind, ""why can't someone make a movie that is rated R and stays true to the story, how difficult is that?"" And finally my prayers have been answered with Blade. This movie pops right out of the pages onto the screen with sheer violence, blood, martial arts, weapons, fire, the good against evil, etc. Yeah sure a lot of action flicks contain all these goodies, and most of them have bombed. But not Blade, the movie was filmed just right, not going overboard, delivering a good length and never a dull moment. Blade II is cool, but not as cool as the first. Blade is indeed one of the best real comic flicks I've seen in a long time."
The Remains of the Day,1993,7.8,A butler who sacrificed body and soul to service in the years leading up to World War II realizes too late how misguided his loyalty was to his lordly employer.,"I have never seen a love story told with such brilliance through subtext and performance. Every glance, pause, and unspoken word carries more weight than entire monologues in other films.I used to think a film like this would be ""boring"" because ""nothing happens."" But watching it now, I realize everything happens!. It's about all the things left unsaid, all the moments missed, and how dignity and duty can become prisons. It's deeply moving, thought-provoking, and quietly shattering.One of the finest literary adaptations I've seen. A slow burn, but by the end, it leaves you hollowed out . . ."
Zombieland,2009,7.5,"A shy student trying to reach his family in Ohio, a gun-toting bruiser in search of the last Twinkie and a pair of sisters striving to get to an amusement park join forces in a trek across a zombie-filled America.","Just came from a sneak preview held in Baltimore and left the theater feeling very satisfied. You don't normally find a late September movie as good as ""Zombieland"" was. After dropping you in the action right from the start, the movie keeps coming with constant laughs and good action. There were not a lot of scares in the movie, other than the few obvious scenes where you could see one coming, but horror is not what the director was going for in this film. Laughs, however, come often and from many different directions. Jessie Eisenberg's nerdy, insecure 'Columbus' character and Woody Harrelson's redneck zombie-killing 'Tallahassee' play very well off each other and provide plenty of memorable moments. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin are also solid throughout. There is also one unforgettable cameo that had most of the audience rolling in the aisles. The film has a simple, easy to follow storyline that does not provoke a lot of questions. Indeed, if you go to this movie expecting a lot of plot twists and surprises, you're going to be severely disappointed. There is however, good action, good laughs, and plenty of zombie related gore. At about 90 minutes long, it does not drag on and gets to the predictable but satisfying ending, going out in style. There will no doubt be a lot of comparisons to ""Shaun of the Dead"", which is nothing to be ashamed of, but this is truly a one of a kind movie experience that holds its own with any not only any zombie movie in recent memory, but with any comedy so far this year. As long as you don't go into this movie expecting too much, you'll get your money's worth. Well done."
Out of the Furnace,2013,6.7,A steelworker takes matters into his own hands after police fail to find his missing brother.,"To be honest, after watching the trailer, i watched this movie only cause it had Bale in it. But it turned out to be surprisingly good with strong performances from everyone involved. Casey Affleck and Zoe Saldana deliver good work on screen. Woody Harelson is also very convincing as the Red neck villain. The director has managed to paint a pretty vivid picture of the environment that he wanted to portray. The storytelling is very engaging. Thumbs up to the director and his team for this effort. In the end, no review can be complete without praising the man who continues to amaze with each performance, Christian Bale. Believable and heart warming in this one. He manages to accomplish the one thing which was most needed from anyone who played this character and that is being able to get the audience to empathize with it. Bale succeeds and then some. Clearly one of his best works till date, and he has an impressive resume already to choose from. A must Watch movie of 2013."
Blade II,2002,6.7,"Blade forms an uneasy alliance with the vampire council in order to combat the Reapers, who are feeding on vampires.","Beneath the streets, behind facades, above the law; conglomerations old and new, slash, shear and saw; unseen but all around, vigilant of every sound, taking lives, destroying chances, tooth and claw.But a new strain has evolved and it bites back, renders vampires into beasts weapons can't crack, an allegiance is convened, to destroy the new obscene, with a violent and quite viscous, counterattack.One of the more accomplished takes on the vampires taking over the world genre, with one of the more accomplished, and even to this day spectacular incarnations of a vampire slayer there's been.The blood flows proportionally."
Into the Wild,2007,8.0,"After graduating from Emory University, top student and athlete Christopher McCandless abandons his possessions, gives his entire $24,000 savings account to charity and hitchhikes to Alaska to live in the wilderness.","Reviewers say 'Into the Wild' is lauded for its breathtaking cinematography, Eddie Vedder's poignant soundtrack, and Emile Hirsch's powerful portrayal of Christopher McCandless. Key themes revolve around nature's splendor, the quest for purpose outside materialism, and intricate human connections. However, critiques target the film's pacing, Sean Penn's directorial decisions, and the depiction of McCandless as either a hero or a misguided individual. Additionally, debates arise over the moral aspects of McCandless's adventure and the movie's adherence to the factual narrative."
Elektra,2005,4.7,An assassin's change of heart leads her into a war against an evil crime syndicate.,"Reviewers say 'Elektra' received mixed reviews, highlighting Jennifer Garner's performance and action sequences. Many praised her portrayal and the fight scenes for their intensity and choreography. However, criticisms focused on the clich√©d, underdeveloped plot and weak villains. The special effects were deemed subpar, and the romantic subplot was seen as unnecessary and poorly executed. Despite these issues, some appreciated the film's entertainment value and visual style."
Mission: Impossible,1996,7.2,"An American agent, under false suspicion of disloyalty, must discover and expose the real spy without the help of his organization.","Reviewers say 'Mission: Impossible' is a thrilling action film with a gripping plot and suspenseful atmosphere. Tom Cruise's performance as Ethan Hunt is lauded, alongside Jon Voight and Ving Rhames. Brian De Palma's direction, special effects, and cinematography are praised. However, some find the plot convoluted and certain scenes less believable. Despite criticisms, it is seen as a strong franchise start."
Jumper,2008,6.1,A young man with teleportation abilities suddenly finds himself in the middle of an ancient war between those like him and their sworn annihilators.,"Stunning effects, swooping camera angles, and an interesting concept more than make up for the film's defects - namely Hayden Christensen - reprising the gloomy, wounded, misunderstood, petulant anti-hero role he played so ineffectively in the Star Wars prequels.The other performances were sound (Samuel L Jackson's hair included) with Jamie Bell particularly outstanding as the nervy Griffin. His performance adds to the frantic energy of the film and every scene without him is the poorer for it.While the pacing and energy of the film keeps you glued to your seat, it is only on reflection that I realised how unsatisfying the story ultimately was - leaving me with an ""is that all?"" kind of feeling. The answer, of course, will probably be 'No' as this film seems to have been made with the idea of sequels firmly in sight.All in all - a tightly made film, with the scenes inside the Colosseum worth the price of admission alone - if only they'd cast someone else in the lead role!"
Frasier,,8.2,"Dr. Frasier Crane moves back to his hometown of Seattle, where he lives with his father and works as a radio psychiatrist.","Reviewers say 'Frasier' is celebrated for its sophisticated humor, intelligent writing, and complex character dynamics. The show delves into family relationships, personal growth, and the clash between highbrow and everyday life. Frasier and Niles' rivalry and Niles' affection for Daphne offer comedic and emotional depth. The ensemble cast, led by Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce, delivers standout performances. Despite some criticisms of later seasons, 'Frasier' remains a beloved classic for its wit and timeless themes."
The Mechanic,2011,6.5,An elite hitman teaches his trade to an apprentice who has a connection to one of his previous victims.,"While I haven't seen the original movie this is based on (same name), I can imagine how Charles Bronson portrayed the character that Jason Statham is playing here. Statham does more than a stellar job, with a great ""side-kick"" Ben Foster (one of the better young actors around right now).The story can be read here on IMDb, though it's not really that important. What is important right here, are the action pieces and the stunt work. All very fine and well shot. And to see Donald Sutherland (even in a small role) is always a treat. The movie is not perfect, but ticks all the right boxes in the right way :o)"
While You Were Sleeping,1995,6.8,A hopelessly romantic Chicago Transit Authority ticket booth operator is mistaken for the fianc√©e of a comatose patient.,"Rom-coms are not my bag; 99% are utter crap. 'While You Were Sleeping' is one of, maybe, three I've ever re-watched. It's criminally low-rated here.8 great things about While You Were Sleeping:1. If you watch it again, and pay attention, you'll pick up something new. Like the whomping thud of a fall by the ice skater at the end of the Chicago winter montage opening credits.On (at least) my fourth watch, I finally realized *why* Lucy has such a thing for Peter. It's not because he's handsome, or his clothes scream money: It's crush at first sight because he looks like her father, down to the bushy black eyebrows.2. The soundtrack is sneaky-good, full of bluesy/old school R&B. Natalie Cole, Koko Taylor, Ella Fitzgerald, Lil' Ed & the Blues Imperials. Yes, it closes with a cheesy duet-but it's Daryl Hall and Dusty Springfield herself. Sign me up!3. There are scads of memorable lines and one-liners. Everyone who enjoys this movie has a favorite. I'm partial to Jack and Peter's 'you suck' exchange in the hospital chapel.4. Remember when lots of movies had real-looking people with real-looking houses, before the days when even a NYC teacher has to be drop-dead gorgeous with a $2mil loft? Only the rich lawyer in WYWS has a rich pad, and that's cool.5. The leading lady has no vanity. She never wears spike heels or shows cleavage. Lucy (Sandra Bullock) dresses like lots of women you know: jeans and baggy sweaters, boots for icy sidewalks. As Peter tells his out-going girlfriend, ""Lucy is *not* a bimbo.""Her hair is a mess nine scenes out of ten, and Bullock is so warm and genuine you love her for it.She's also not taking the world by storm. Lucy is funny, adorable, sentimental...and the hot dog vendor she sees every day never remembers her.6. Jack (Bill Pullman) is a woodworker! Let's just say I've known loads of craftsmen and lawyers in my professional life...and one creates things from nothing while the other largely takes things apart.Most rom-coms have 'insert hot guy here' interchangeable casting, but Pullman is perfect here: self-effacing, funny, a little scruffy, with just the right amount of gravel in his voice. He's charming, a bit snarky-and he single-handedly redeems the film's cheesiest scene by facing the camera with sudden tears in his eyes.7. You can relate to the Callaghans. If you've ever been shushed in church. If non-sequiturs and talking-over fly at the dinner table. Argentinian beef and nazis, tall actors and mashed potatoes. If there's at least one rogue grandparent
or mensch friend and nobody's perfect but everyone laughs a lot. You don't have to actually be Irish. Though it helps.8. The supporting cast is pretty flawless all-around. Even the trope roles are lively. Jack Warden, Glynis Johns, Peter Boyle, Ally Walker and Peter Gallagher as a largely comatose, narcissistic, wide-eyed doofus of a one-balled squirrel-saver.In the end, WYWS is more funny than trite, a low-gloss, feel-good film with a saving grace of quirk."
Miss Congeniality,2000,6.3,"Gracie Hart, a tomboyish detective, is forced to infiltrate the Miss United States beauty pageant as a contestant after her department learns that the event is under threat from an anonymous bomber.","Sandra Bullock's facial expressions, physical comedy, comedic timing, and great lines: Ditto for Michael Caine. Not a great movie, but very good, and those two performances, plus Shatner's as the emcee, make it a very worthwhile movie. When movies like Anchorman get a 7.2 by comparison, I feel like I'm somewhat alien to this planet......Keep forgetting that being concise on this website is not an attribute, so I'll digress. Humor is subjective, so everyone has their own, equally valid opinion, but IMHO Sandra nailed it, was at the height of her comedic prowess in this movie, and it will stand up over time not so much as a great movie (not), but a great performance by Bullock."
Primal Fear,1996,7.7,A high-profile murder intrigues a publicity hungry lawyer.,"I was convinced that ""Primal Fear"" would be the type of courtroom drama that Hollywood seems to use to pave the streets with. You know what I mean: Someone gets wrongly accused of some mischief, he can't pay a lawyer, but of course there is one who is really interested in the case and he is prepared to defend the poor guy anyway. The defender finds some wholes in the police investigation or in the statement of the other party and knows to prove the innocence of his client and even get a big indemnity. Well, I was wrong, for once this was a courtroom drama that had a bit more to offer than the usual story line and twists. In fact, this was even a very enjoyable movie.Even though I'm not really a fan of Richard Gere (I'm not a woman, so no I don't like him because the way he looks, I only look at his acting), I have to admit that this time he really did a very good job as the slick, media-friendly, arrogant lawyer Martin Vail. Still, in my opinion the real star in this movie is Edward Norton. He's really excellent as the altar boy who is accused of murdering a Catholic bishop.For once the story isn't as predictable as usual. At first the case seems rather clear: an altar boy is running away from the home of the bishop, with blood all over his clothes. No doubt about it you think, he did it, case closed, next movie! But than the first interesting twist in the movie appears: Yes, he was at the murder scene, but he can't remember anything about the grisly murder, because at that exact moment he got a blackout. He's convinced that there was a third person in the room. That third person must have killed the bishop, he's innocent. His lawyer tries to prove the third man theory in the court room, but as the process comes nearer to the end, some new evidence will make everything a lot clearer and more interesting...As I already said, this movie is more than just worth a watch, thanks to the rather innovative story line and characters. For once, this movie didn't annoy me more than I could ever like it. That's already worth a lot, so I give it a well deserved 8/10."
Aladdin,1992,8.0,A kind-hearted street urchin and a power-hungry Grand Vizier vie for a magic lamp that has the power to make their deepest wishes come true.,"The 31st animated Disney classic is one of Disney's best known movies. It also takes us to a whole new world, a new fantastic point of view. This one takes place in Saudi Arabia. I've always liked this movie.""Aladdin"" is very entertaining and great fun. It is hilarious, creative, imaginative and romantic. It isn't a faultless movie, but it's a little difficult not to like it.I'll start by talking about the characters. The blue Genie is, without a doubt, the most amusing, hilarious, imaginative and genial Genie ever created. Robin Williams steals the show as the Genie's voice. With his incredible talent to do voices, he's hilariously awesome and fantastic as the Genie's voice (and also as the voice of the enigmatic merchant that appears at the beginning, who happens to be an interesting character).Iago is the funniest character of this movie, along with the Genie. Nobody better than Gilbert Gottfried to voice the sarcastic parrot. Iago is simply hilarious! He's rude, grumpy, sarcastic, hungry for power, malicious, obnoxious and foul-tempered. He has an irritating voice but in a funny way, as well as a great talent to perfectly mimic other characters's voices. However, deep down inside he has a heart. I also love his hate for crackers. I don't see why does he hates crackers so much, but that also makes him so funny! Besides, a parrot with teeth?? lol!Jafar is a great villain. Although often calm and humorous (for example, he keeps calling ""Prince Abooboo"" to ""Prince Ali""), he also represents the worst and most ambitious kind of villain and he is one of the most dangerous Disney villains. And he does possess a snake-like tone of voice sometimes.Princess Jasmine, what can I say? Have you ever seen a more beautiful Disney princess? She's just gorgeous! Despite her strong and challenging personality, I like her anyway.The Sultan is a funny dude. The Magic Carpet is lovable, one of my favorite characters from the movie. Aladdin himself is a nice guy, poor but kind-hearted (although dishonest, immature and selfish sometimes).Abu is funny mostly because of his vocal sounds, very Donald Duck-like. The Cave of Wonders is an amazing character. It is a giant tiger's head with an absolutely fantastic and brutal deep-throat voice.""Aladdin"" is a festival of magic, special effects, bombastic humor and jokes.By the way, I absolutely love the song ""A Whole New World"". The version sung by Aladdin and Jasmine is great, but the original version of Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle is better, deeper and more romantic and classic. It's a very romantic and joyful song, which is always a pleasure to listen. ""Arabian Nights"" is a nice song as well...I'd only wish that ""Aladdin"" hadn't become a victim of its own success. It inspired 2 sequels and several stories with these characters.This should definitely be on Top 250."
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,2007,7.1,"Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann, Hector Barbossa, and the crew of the Black Pearl try and rescue Jack from davy jones locker and prepare to fight Lord Cutler Beckett, who controls Davy Jones and the Flying Dutchman.","AWE was a decent close to the trilogy (although they did leave it open for the possibility of a 4th).Lets go down the list: 1) Holy cow. The CGI is breathtaking. The details on the sets is just as breathtaking. The filming sites were beautiful. These are a talented group of folks I tell ya. GREAT job.2) Acting .. both good and bad. Sparrow, Barbossa, Beckett, Norrington, Jones, and Gibbs provided some very good acting and funny moments. However, they were offset by Pintel and Ragetti (they got annoying in the 2nd film and it didn't stop here. While I enjoyed the idea of Tia Dalma's character, I wasn't impressed with the performance by beautiful Miss Harris. I haven't especially liked Keira all that much in other things she has done and it was the same here. Decent actress but not overly impressive. Stellan's portrayal of Bill Turner was decent enough but a notch down from what we KNOW he can do. Now the best for last. Im a 100% hetero male and even I can say that Orlando Bloom is a VERY good looking guy. But for the love of pete, this guy is one of the most terrible actors ever and strangely, he was cast in two of the biggest, most profitable trilogies ever. He has essentially played the same character in every movie, just with different costumes. His mannerisms, his low ""sexy"" voice, his facial expressions .. ALLLL the same, all the time. Sooo blahhhhhhh.3) The story was good but there was too much of it. It has been said here but I will say it again. At one point, I just stopped trying to follow along and just enjoyed it. Everyone stabbed everyone else in the back at least once. It wasn't ""hard to follow"" but a movie like this isn't supposed to make you think. You want that, go see .... Clue :P the whole Singapore thing was just unneeded. While it did add a new element to the film, it just seemed too forced.4) Running time was a tad bit long but it passed fairly quickly due to the great action sequences.All in all .. I was impressed with the movie, but it has its problems. Much like part 2.I say go and see it. You wont be disappointed but you wont walk out thinking you just saw a masterpiece either.Just my thoughts ..."
Bad Boys,1995,6.8,Two hip detectives protect a witness to a murder while investigating a case of stolen heroin from the evidence storage room from their police precinct.,"As a protege of Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson, who died after the movie came out before The Rock was released, Michael Bay made his directorial debut with this modestly budgeted buddy comedy that spawned a sequel and another one coming out next January, all starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. THe title of the movie is based on a popular song used for the classic tv show COPS, and both movies including this one have a killer soundtrack. Will Smith got his big break with this movie before getting into an even bigger movie with ID4 (soon to be dwarfed by others including Alladin). Martin Lawrence, fresh off from his hit tv show Martin on fox, is the buddy of will smith."
Cocktail,1988,5.9,A talented New York City bartender takes a job at a bar in Jamaica and falls in love.,"If only real life was like this surprise success with Tom Cruise flashing his teeth in what was to become his standard role as a young whippersnapper on the make while scoring with rich chicks.The busy story (adapted by Heywood Gould from his original novel) is energetically directed by Australian newcomer Roger Donaldson, and although Cruise is officially the star, the best performance is inevitably that of Donaldson's fellow antipodean Bryan Brown (described by Cruise as looking like a guy ""who dyes his hair and shaves with a Brillo"").It's all very eighties, lines like ""The Donald Trump of the Cookie Business"" having since acquired an unforeseen resonance."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,2006,7.4,"Jack Sparrow races to recover the heart of Davy Jones to avoid enslaving his soul to Jones' service, as other friends and foes seek the heart for their own agenda as well.","This movie has everything a good blockbuster should have: star cast, special effects, a healthy dose of drama, romance, a villain (so to say), sadly also a rather weak story, with an ending just calling for ""part three"" (just like the last second in the Matrix trilogy) I didn't get that feeling, that the adventure is finished somehow, more like a soap opera ending. On the other hand some dialogs are really funny, and the whole movie is more like a parody on pirates.All and all: go and see this, sit down in that cinema and have a good time with friends, but if you are more into ""heavy for the mind"" stuff, this is not a must-see for you."
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,2005,6.7,"Charlie, a young boy from an impoverished family, and four other kids win a tour of an amazing chocolate factory run by an imaginative chocolatier, Willy Wonka, and his staff of Oompa-Loompas.","I watch again again and beatiful movie for me special,epic:)"
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,2014,7.6,The fragile peace between apes and humans is threatened as mistrust and betrayal threaten to plunge both tribes into a war for dominance over the Earth.,"A really great follow up that builds on what the first film set up, and still features fantastic effects, performances and action, even if they still haven't fixed some of the problems with the original. The big issue across these two films is that the human characters are very one-note and bland. Gary Oldman is the only complex human character in it - the rest just have one personality trait that is well explored, if that, and a lot of them make very stupid decisions. But on the flip side, Caesar is a fantastic character, and I really like how the apes' opinions on humans are affected directly by their experiences of them - it makes their characters a lot better. Andy Serkis is still fantastic, and the effects have aged very, very well. The action is really well shot, and has a really nice gritty feel, particularly in the second half. I will say that the first half was a tad slow for me, but I did appreciate how the film spent time building up the characters in order to go all out for the finale. The cinematography is strong and the story is well developed - those opening few minutes really pack a punch now. Overall, I wouldn't call this one of the best sequels of all time, but it is a genuinely great and recommendable film."
My Best Friend's Wedding,1997,6.4,"When a woman's long-time friend reveals he's engaged, she realizes she loves him herself and sets out to get him, with only days before the wedding.","Good film. Some of the camerawork is also more interesting than one might expect, with particularly powerful close-ups where one or two faces fill the screen. Julia Roberts' beauty comes through in a long shot which starts to look like a shampoo commercial: long curly hair spills around her head as she lies in despair on the floor (the public safety message being, don't ever sit with your back against a door which an irate ex-lover might wrench open at any minute); nevertheless, the proximity gives us an intimacy with her character we might otherwise miss. Another effective shot of this kind (two heads on a pillow fill the screen) drives home the theme touched on here of the devastatingly attractive gay man who is made doubly so by his inaccessibility.7/10."
Men in Black 3,2012,6.8,Agent J travels in time to M.I.B.'s early days in 1969 to stop an alien from assassinating his friend Agent K and changing history.,"This film is about Agent J going back in time to rescue Agent K from being murdered by aliens.My friends say that ""Men in Black III"" is a brainless comedy, you can go in just for a few laughs and switch your brain off. After watching it, I can safely say that I have another opinion.""Men in Black III"" does have its brainless moments. It can be politically incorrect too, but it is entertaining and fun to watch. Special effects are realistic, and the scene involving a very tall building made me so nervous that my palms perspired a lot! The ending is very touching; I certainly did not see it coming even though a friend guessed it.I think it is great that ""Men in Black III"" manages to combine emotional elements in the middle of mainstream blockbuster entertainment. I look forward to the next film in the series already."
Constantine,2005,7.0,"Detective Angela approaches Constantine, a demon hunter, to help her investigate her twin sister's mysterious death. As he digs deeper, he realizes that demons are trying to enter the human world.","Funny enough watching another really original film brought me here. I was telling someone about it and they said oh you have to watch Constantine, The prophecy, and Devil's Advocate.Loved The Harbinger and now love all Four of these! This movie has a great ambience and darkness without being a pure jump scare movie. I love the overall mood.I've seen enough devil movies to know that a lot of them are not very original but these 4 are.Won't give spoilers, but love the endings to all of them. The Harbinger and The Prophecy have a native American element which I thought was cool, but these two Constantine and Devil's Advocate still have master storytelling and a much higher production value than The Harbinger. Devils Advocate is slightly ahead of Constantine for me. But Thumbs up on Constantine and fun watch!"
Runaway Bride,1999,5.6,"For his latest column in USA Today, Ike Graham writes about Maggie, who always leaves all her fiances standing at the altar. He is fired as she complains to the newspaper for inaccuracies in her story.","Following up on the huge romantic hit ""Pretty Woman,"" Richard Gere, Julia Roberts and Hector Elizondo reteam to produce yet another romantic comedy called ""Runaway Bride.""Nobody lost a step or missed a beat as Gere, Roberts and Elizondo teamed up with newcomers Joan Cusack and Rita Wilson. The cast performed with such perfection it seemed like they were performing as it happened for the first time. I commend the casting director and the producer for putting together an excellent cast that really gelled and had chemistry that was like magic.I must say that ""Runaway Bride"" was much more charming than ""Pretty Woman."" I still enjoyed ""Pretty Woman"" but the updated version had a certain charm and a twist that was lacking in the first film.I can't say what the twist is without giving away too much, you'll just have to see it to find out.This was a cute film with a unique way of telling a plot that seems to have been done before on the silver screen."
Ticker,2001,3.5,"After a San Francisco detective's partner is murdered by Northern Irish terrorists, the officer joins the bomb squad in order to bring them to justice.","The thought of seeing three actors that i like made me watch this film. Of them (Seagal, Hopper, Sizemore) only Seagal i feel puts a performance in. It is a very poorly directed film. The action scenes are extremely bad. I feel the actors were just cashing in on the movie. Overall its one to forget."
Gilmore Girls,,8.2,"A dramedy centering around the relationship between a thirtysomething single mother and her teen daughter living in Stars Hollow, Connecticut.","Reviewers say Gilmore Girls is celebrated for its sharp dialogue, strong character development, and the unique mother-daughter bond. The quirky characters and Stars Hollow setting are praised. The show blends humor, drama, and heartfelt moments, exploring family dynamics and growth. However, some find the fast-paced dialogue unrealistic and certain characters annoying. Later seasons are criticized for quality decline. Despite this, it remains a comforting watch with a dedicated fanbase."
The Simpsons Movie,2007,7.3,"After Homer pollutes the town's water supply, Springfield is encased in a gigantic dome by the EPA and the Simpsons are declared fugitives.","In this big-screen adventure featuring the lovable folk of Springfield, trouble brews for the Simpson family after Homer irresponsibly pollutes the local water supply with tons of pig manure. As a result of this thoughtless action, the town is encased in a huge dome by the Environment Protection Agency and, after angry Springfield citizens form a lynch mob, Homer and his family are forced to become fugitives.How much you enjoy The Simpsons Movie will depend entirely on your opinion of the current Simpsons TV show: if you have loved the past few seasons, then you'll have a great time¬óthe movie is as funny, if not slightly better, than your average episode of recent years. Those of us, however, who recognise that the show has long since passed its prime will feel underwhelmed: the movie is often amusing, but very rarely hilarious.And that's just not good enough! When a series as successful as The Simpsons takes 20 years to make the leap from the small screen to the big screen, it had better be damn good¬ónay, it had better be exceptional!! Instead, this rather uninspired product just doesn't make the wait worthwhile.5 out of 10, bumped up to 6 out of a misguided sense of loyalty to a show that has given me so much fun in the past."
Prison Break,,8.3,"A structural engineer installs himself in a prison he helped design, in order to save his falsely accused brother from a death sentence by breaking themselves out from the inside.","Reviewers say 'Prison Break' is lauded for its gripping narrative, standout performances by Wentworth Miller and Dominic Purcell, and complex plot twists. Key themes such as brotherhood, loyalty, and sacrifice resonate with audiences. However, critiques highlight uneven pacing, contrived plot elements, and a noticeable drop in quality post-first season. Unrealistic scenarios and inconsistencies, particularly in later seasons, are also noted. Despite these flaws, many viewers find the series compelling and suggest watching at least the initial two seasons."
The Big Bang Theory,,8.1,"Aspiring film actress Penny moves into a Pasadena apartment across the hall from brilliant, but socially awkward, physicists Sheldon Cooper and Leonard Hofstadter and shows them how little they know about life outside of the lab.","Reviewers say 'The Big Bang Theory' is acclaimed for its early seasons' clever humor, strong character development, and science-pop culture blend. The chemistry between Sheldon and Leonard, and the show's accessible science approach, are highlights. However, later seasons faced criticism for repetitive jokes, stale humor, and relationship-driven plots. The reliance on stereotypes and character evolution received mixed reactions. Despite these issues, many still find it comforting, particularly the earlier seasons."
Friends,,8.9,Follows the personal and professional lives of six twenty to thirty year-old friends living in the Manhattan borough of New York City.,"Reviewers say 'Friends' is celebrated for Chandler's humor and sarcasm, making him a fan favorite. Phoebe's quirky and eccentric personality is noted, though some find her annoying. Monica is recognized for her cleanliness and controlling nature, with mixed opinions on her character development. The show's ensemble cast and dynamic interactions receive widespread acclaim, though some critics argue certain storylines can be repetitive or rely too heavily on clich√©s."
How I Met Your Mother,,8.3,A father recounts to his children the journey he and his four best friends took leading up to him meeting their mother.,"Reviewers say 'How I Met Your Mother' is acclaimed for its unique storytelling and blend of comedy and heartfelt moments. The narrative structure and character development, especially Barney Stinson, are praised. The ensemble cast's chemistry and themes of friendship and love resonate. However, some criticize later seasons and the finale for not meeting earlier quality, though many still enjoy the series."
Scrubs,,8.4,"In the unreal world of Sacred Heart Hospital, intern John ""J.D."" Dorian learns the ways of medicine, friendship and life.","After getting extremely bored of the current new releases on my streaming services I decided to give Scrubs a try 20 years after it first aired and up till last week I'd never seen a minute of this show
Well I'm late to the party and boy am I glad I finally found it
I'm already through 2 & a bit seasons and I'm still roaring with laughter at the cartoonish nature and over the top clips on the smallest of pointsIf your looking for a light brain free tv show that's legitimately funny from start to finish that's 25ish minutes an episode so it's not a massive chunk of your day (unless like me you let them run through and 4 hours vanishes when you've got 40 minutes for lunch break whoops)Fingers crossed this great old show keeps at the early levels"
House M.D.,,8.7,"Using a crack team of doctors and his wits, an antisocial maverick doctor specializing in diagnostic medicine does whatever it takes to solve puzzling cases that come his way.","Reviewers say 'House M.D.' is acclaimed for its compelling character dynamics, especially Hugh Laurie's portrayal of Dr. Gregory House. The show is celebrated for its intricate medical cases, dark humor, and the blend of drama and comedy. However, some critics note repetitive plot structures and a shift towards personal relationships over medical intrigue in later seasons. Despite these issues, 'House M.D.' is generally considered a standout in the medical drama genre, providing intellectual stimulation and emotional depth."
Notting Hill,1999,7.2,"A set of circumstances makes Anna Scott, a famous actress, fall in love with William Thacker, owner of a bookstore in Notting Hill. But the paparazzi's fascination with her complicates their bond.","This movie is almost entirely character driven and it is great. It's very funny, positive and enjoyable. The story is very simple - classic boy meets girl (or vice-versa) scenario. However, Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts' outstanding performances propel this movie to greatness.Hugh Grant delivers one of his best 'average, humble' guy performances in this movie. Many of his lines were some of the most witty and clever dialog I've heard in a while. Almost reminds me of how Jimmy Stewart could mumble lines and come off as brilliant.Julia Roberts was sparkling as a somewhat forward but grounded movie star that one could relate to. It was pleasant to see lots of big smiles from Julia.The other characters were literally 'characters' - bizarre, off-beat, odd-ball, goofy - but at heart warm and enjoyable to watch.If you're in the mood for a good laugh and pleasant movie-going experience, this is a great movie to watch."
The Simpsons,,8.6,The satiric half-hour adventures of a working-class family in the misfit city of Springfield.,"Reviewers say 'The Simpsons' is celebrated for its groundbreaking satire, clever writing, and iconic characters. Early seasons are praised for sharp wit and social commentary. However, later seasons face criticism for repetitive humor and character inconsistencies. Changes in writing staff and creative direction are noted as reasons for the decline. Despite this, the show remains a cultural phenomenon with lasting impact."
Family Guy,,8.1,"In a wacky Rhode Island town, a dysfunctional family strives to cope with everyday life as they are thrown from one crazy scenario to another.","Reviewers say 'Family Guy' is celebrated for its irreverent humor, offbeat storytelling, and iconic characters. The show's boundary-pushing comedy and sharp social commentary resonate with many. Its rapid-fire gags and cutaway jokes maintain viewer engagement. However, the series faces criticism for inconsistent quality, with some episodes criticized for relying on shock value. The frequent use of cutaway gags can disrupt narrative flow. Despite these drawbacks, 'Family Guy' remains a significant and beloved animated sitcom."
Miss Congeniality 2: Armed & Fabulous,2005,5.2,"Gracie Hart abandons the life of a field agent to become the public face of the FBI. Yet, when Cheryl Frasier and Stan Fields are kidnapped, she is determined to rescue them, along with her reluctant partner.","Sandra Bullock returns as Gracie Hart, the federal agent who went undercover at the Miss United States pageant four years ago. When the pageant emcee Stan Fields (William Shatner) and Miss USA (Heather Burns) are kidnapped in Las Vegas, Gracie needs to put aside her cushy lifestyle on the talk show circuit to go back into action, taking on a very unhappy new partner in Sam Fuller (Regina King).Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous isn't as good as the original but it still manages to deliver some funny scenes. The original was a fun, harmless movie though nothing memorable. The sequel falls under the same category but it's not nearly as much fun as the first film. Actually, the fun factor is only seen in Bullock and King everything else was poorly handled. Sure there were some fun moments but certainly not enough to sustain the really long running time. Also, Michael Caine and Benjamin Bratt don't appear in the movie. I miss Caine since he was pretty funny in the first one. I don't really miss Bratt because he's not that good of an actor.The acting is pretty good and it's the best thing the movie has to offer. Sandra Bullock gives a funny and enjoyable performance as Gracie Hart. Her charm is what carries this sequel and she proves to be a delight on screen. Regina King also gives a funny performance and she's a nice addition to the series. The chemistry between Bullock and King is great and their scenes together is what drives the movie. William Shatner and Heather Burns don't really do anything special. Diedrich Bader gives an annoying performance as Joel. Treat Williams and Enrique Murciano just play their roles as much as the screenplay allows it and they don't really do anything special.I think the main reason why this sequel isn't as good as the original is because the premise is nearly the same. They could have been a little more creative with the story. Also, the original movie wrapped up nicely and it didn't demand a sequel. So, this movie seems like a cash in on a popular film and little time was actually spent on the script. The running time is 115 minutes and this could have been edited. There were a bunch of pointless scenes and the movie just doesn't contain enough fresh material to keep the film funny or interesting. Also, the film is very predictable and sitting through a long, predictable movie wasn't that much fun. I need to question the point of making a sequel. It seemed like a lazy attempt and the film was only average because of Bullock and King. In the end, this unnecessary sequel isn't really worth watching unless you're a fan of Bullock or King. Rating 5/10"
Angels & Demons,2009,6.7,Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon works with a nuclear physicist to solve a murder and prevent a terrorist act against the Vatican during one of the significant events within the church.,"Symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is called to Rome to help decipher the mystery behind the Illuminati before a new science experiment blows up the city.The Da Vinci Code broke records in 2006 but for the vast majority of Dan Brown followers it did not do his award winning book justice and though running at a good 2 and a half hours, seemed to bore many.Having read the book, I was perhaps one of the few who enjoyed Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou attempt to solve the mystery of the murder in the Louvre but for Angels and Demons the scales were raised once more as lead star and director return.Having asked around, most people seem to prefer Angels and Demons to The Da Vinci code for an entertaining read and it seems as critiques and fans, whilst still not fully justified, prefer this latest adaptation to the 2006 release.This Howard picture certainly has a more clinical energy and exercise to it as unlike Da Vinci, Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon has only one night to solve the mysterious activities of the forgotten Illuminati in the Vatican and because of the time limitations, the action and desperation up the ante and deliver an excitement that certainly beats The Da Vinci code but also generates plenty of twists and stunning murder sequences.The interesting factor of this 2009 release is the constant elements being justified for the murders. Earth, wind, water and fire are all included in drastic and powerful sequences to pronounce a feeling of overall power to the situation.This really does justify the tag of thriller with a constant tension and sharp drama with the issues and beliefs once more given a full working over.Just like 3 years ago, there are many debates and discoveries of symbols once believed to be lost forever and Langdon is again the key character to show everyone the light in and amongst the controversy of other pressing circumstances.It is fair to say Dan Brown is a complex writer; he certainly likes to cram issues and dramas in amongst his action and thrilling sequences. As well as trying to discover the Illuminati, there is also the scenario of the election of a new pope, the dealings with a new scientific experiment and the power of Religion is again present. All interesting to discover and listen to, if occasionally the debates and dialogue tend to send your mind drifting but as there is so much in the novel, this was always likely.Ron Howard, who kept a frankly ordinary type of direction rolling in Da Vinci, returns in perhaps the worst way possible. His jerky ever moving camera styling does nothing to keep the pressure up, and we can never fully accept what is happening on screen thanks to this frankly awfully portrayed style. He is certainly no Paul Greengrass and this is by no means Bourne.Slick and stylized this is faster and more interesting than Da Vinci"
Resident Evil: Afterlife,2010,5.8,"While still out to destroy the evil Umbrella Corporation, Alice joins a group of survivors living in a prison surrounded by the infected who also want to relocate to the mysterious but supposedly unharmed safe haven known only as Arcadia.","A prison breakout's always fun, especially if you're on the run, from multi-tongued mutant defiance, or a hooded giant axe wielding giant. Arcadia's moored just off the shore, if you make it there your safe for sure, just try to avoid the shaded fella, who pulls the strings of Umbrella. If your losing faith with all the confusion, you need to prepare for retribution, where everything you've seen before, is repeated, recycled, churned, turned once more."
Blades of Glory,2007,6.3,"Two rival Olympic ice skaters, who have been permanently banned from the men's singles competition due to a feud, exploit a loophole that will allow them to qualify as a pairs team.","I first saw this movie on a plane flight. Oh dear ! My hysterical laughter didn't go down too well with some fellow passengers. I had an interest in the movie from the start having been an ice skater some years ago. What a great mix of pure comedy and outrageous farce this movie is. Two guys who hate each other forced to make a skating-pair. Ferrell is full on, Heder is petulant. It's clash of two diverse personalities forced to perform as a pair on ice. It is so very funny and ranks as my 2nd favourite comedy movie of all time after ""Airplane"" (1980)"
Devil in a Blue Dress,1995,6.8,"A Black war hero is hired to find a mysterious woman, and gets mixed up in a murderous political scandal in 1948 Los Angeles.","This has a convoluted story like out of Chandler. There's the dreamy woman who has disappeared, the unlikely schmo hired to find her. She is white, a rich man's wife thought to have disappeared in the black side of town. They get him to investigate, a black guy who just wants to make mortgage so he can simply keep owning his house.A lot of snooping around in clubs and seamy places around LA follows. People turning up dead in the night and he stands to get the rap. Hidden machinations that involve people in high places, a set of incriminating photos with a mayoral election in the balance. And all this as the noir world that turns against the protagonist - he's beaten, framed for murder, used as pawn - but, being a black man, it now acquires another layer of significance that conveys a more real plight than Marlowe.And we have a curious eye of the camera, a world rife with texture and depth. This isn't the glossy recreation of an era that we find in LA Confidential, but more like Altman where we brush against spaces and the world surrounds from all sides. In this aspect it's worthy of The Long Goodbye. It has all these marvelous places, the blues club above the convenience store, the cabin up in the hills where a dead body turns up, his sunny neighborhood that is routinely invaded.It's as good as if adapted from Chandler, plus about black experience in a world where boundaries are drawn starkly against you, plus a world rife for exploration as these boundaries are tranversed. It's good stuff, this one. They tried to set it up for future films where Denzel returns as the PI but I see that it didn't pan out. First time's the charm anyway.Noir Meter: 3/4 / Neo-noir or post noir? Neo"
Sex and the City,,7.4,Four female New Yorkers gossip about their sex lives (or lack thereof) and find new ways to deal witha woman in the late 1990s.,"There are some series that really take you back to a certain era. Series that have characters that stick with you as you move through your own life. Sex and the City does that, and it is always wonderful to re-watch it."
South Park,,8.7,"Follows the misadventures of four foul mouthed and dirty minded irreverent grade-schoolers, Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormick who live in the quiet, dysfunctional mountain town of South Park, Colorado.","Reviewers say 'South Park' is celebrated for its bold, satirical take on current events, social issues, and pop culture, often pushing television boundaries. Known for crude humor and controversial topics, it garners both praise and criticism. Its unique animation, rapid production, and timely issue addressing stand out. Main characters Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny bring distinct personalities. Despite varying opinions on its quality, 'South Park' remains a significant cultural phenomenon, influencing animated comedy and sparking censorship debates."
You've Got Mail,1998,6.7,"Book superstore magnate Joe Fox and independent book shop owner Kathleen Kelly fall in love in the anonymity of the Internet, both blissfully unaware that he's trying to put her out of business.","Pleasant, warm-hearted fluff reworking 1940's ""The Shop Around the Corner"" (remade initially in 1949 as the musical ""In The Good Old Summertime""). Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan reteam for the second time as rival bookstore owners in New York City: she operates a Mom & Pop bookshop, he's opening another outlet in his retail chain nearby. They lock horns over business, yet are unaware they are also each other's internet pen-pal. Slick and occasionally too-cute, too cookie cutter, but also an entertaining picture nicely set during the holidays. Ryan can't help but radiate personality and charm, though Hanks is curiously rote here (and he looks tired to boot),. Terrific supporting cast certainly helps, with Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey, Jean Stapleton and Steve Zahn making up a bright ensemble. Engaging, if you're not too demanding. *** from ****"
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,2004,7.1,"In the 1970s, an anchorman's stint as San Diego's top-rated newsreader is challenged when an ambitious newswoman becomes his co-anchor.","I had been avoiding myself from watching 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' for a long time because I thought that it would be another one of those wannabe non-funny comedies. I liked Ferrell a lot in comedies like 'Legally Blonde' and 'Stranger Than Fiction' where he really downplays the humour but I saw some of his Saturday Night Live sketches and many were plain awful. Anyway, I later found out that the cast also included Christina Applegate, Paul Rudd and Steve Carell and so I was curious to how Ferrell works with these talented comedy actors.So that's that and now, after having seen it, I must add that 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' is a laugh riot. It superbly spoofs the 70s. Adam McKay brings together an excellent comedic cast playing colourful characters. Ferrell and Applegate are at the centre of the film and both are stupendous! But the supporting cast that includes David Koechner as a 'macho' wannabe who's actually a closet homosexual, Paul Rudd as a virgin stud, Steven Carell as a mentally stunted weatherman and Fred Willard as the laid back boss equally stand out with their gags and superb comic timing. Just when I was thinking that it would be funny if Vince Vaughn was part of the cast, he appears on screen as the 'deadly' rival. There are also notable cameos by a psychopathic Tim Robbins, a Hispanic Ben Stiller, an armless Luke Wilson and Jack Black as a cruel junkie.I'd recommend to watch the movie with English subtitles as there are some hilarious lines between Burgundy's dog and a bear which is spoken in animal language. There are so many more laugh-out-loud moments that it's hard for me to single out a particular scene. Which one shall I say? The scene where he plays the flute to impress Veronica, Veronica screaming 'Ron!' (in typical 70's melodramatic style) when he gets fired, the entire bear awakening sequence, the battle between the anchormen, Veronica challenging Ed with her three strengths: screwing, fighting and news-reading ....there's just too many.While being an out-and-out comedy, it does bring forth some serious issues like gender equality (which was still a problem in the 70s). Though the undertone is serious, it's all presented in a comedic way but it never makes fun of the issue. For example, Veronica is continuously harassed by her male co-workers but she stays strong without succumbing to their rudeness.'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' is a joyride all the way. Whether one likes the film or not, I'm sure they at least would have a good laugh."
Brave,2012,7.1,"Determined to make her own path in life, Princess Merida defies a custom that brings chaos to her kingdom. Granted one wish, Merida must rely on her bravery and her archery skills to undo a beastly curse.","Brave is a film I've been looking forward to since I first laid eyes on it's beautiful trailer. It had everything a great Pixar film has: a wonderful setting, fantastic CGI, beautiful and interesting characters, and a lot of heart. In fact, Merida alone was such an interesting and adorable character, that it was instantly on my to watch list. Granted, this isn't Pixar's best, but that's holding it up to extremely high standards. As an animated film, however, this is a fantastic and fascinating film, a treat for the summer.Brave tells the story of the aforementioned Merida, a young, Scottish princess whose life is controlled by her mother so that she can be shaped into a queen someday over the surrounding tribes. In an effort to change her fate and be free of her oppressive, but loving mother, she attempts to change her fate, and in the process makes a huge mistake. I won't get into plot details, as the trailer really doesn't give a lot away in terms of what this film is really about, but suffice to say, there is plenty of fun and adventure to be had.Pixar always manages to create an interesting and unique tale, and this goes right up there with the best of them. Using the Scottish highlands is both an inspiring choice and allows them to craft a beautiful film. With sweeping mountains, water, and thick and colorful forests, this is one of Pixar's best looking films to date. It trumps the jungles of UP and even the magical underwater world of Finding Nemo. There is a certain amount of magic in the environments alone, and gazing on it is a wonder. The characters are also fantastic. Merida is a wonderful addition to Disney's princess lineup, and unlike those others, she is no damsel in distress. She, like her mother, is perfectly capable of handling herself, with her trusty archery skills and even tackles a few dangerous situations on her own instead of having someone there to save her. In fact, this could be seen as an inverse, as Merida actually becomes a hero in many ways and triumphs over the males in her own age bracket. Also of note is Billy Connolly, voicing Fergus, who lends his comedic chops to create a wonderful and likable character.While this film may not be up there with Pixar's best, it still has a wonderful story and character interaction. Merida's relationship with her family feels genuine and most children will probably be able to relate. At the heart of the story is her relationship with her mother. This is more than a story about fate, but a story about obligations to family and how growing up means taking responsibility and putting away childish selfishness in place of those responsibilities. Although the core plot is unconventional and unexpected, it has a fantastic heart and once again proves that Pixar can tell a story like no other.Brave is an entertaining, humorous, and heartfelt story that will be wonderful for kids and adults alike. Merida is a wonderful new character and the entire film looks beautiful. Even if you don't have children, I recommend this film if you've loved other Pixar's before it."
Malcolm in the Middle,,8.2,"A gifted young teen tries to survive life with his dimwitted, dysfunctional family.","Malcolm in the Middle is an incredible show. My feeling toward the show was rather mixed when they began showing promos. It looked funny, but silly and unoriginal. After all, the concept of a family that doesn't get along is nothing new. The show turned out to be better than I expected. It's not a live action version of The Simpsons like some critics claim, but it is very funny. Don't be quick to judge the show or you might find the jokes go over your head. Thumbs up on this one."
Oblivion,2013,7.0,A stranger's arrival triggers one man's battle to save mankind.,"A provocative story kernel in its own right, yet it pulls fragments from too many genre greats making it a clich√©d mosaic pastiche of a post apocalyptic world where everything is not as it seems.The opening third is intriguing and well played with a strong three-way dynamic between Jack, Victoria and their mysterious video-comm handler; it piques interest and poses many questions. Jack's questioning nature and feeling that something is 'off' contrasts with the 'happy clappy', following orders vibe from Victoria.This dynamic is enhanced with the addition of a fourth character Julia, who is already in Jack's dreams - a fabulous performance from Olga Kurylenko. From there though, the movie loses its charm and becomes completely generic.Fabulous cinematography uses distinct color palettes to denote time and location, admirably supported by excellent effects. The soundtrack is also strong with carefully selected music.Overall this is a good watch, but flatters to deceive. With more self-confident writing this could have become a classic."
That '70s Show,,8.1,"A comedy revolving around a group of teenage friends, their mishaps, and their coming of age, set in 1970s Wisconsin.","From the very first episode That '70s Shows delivered a very consisting humor and is definitely without a doubt in one's mind that this is one of the funniest show ever created.Brief: That '70s Shows tell us the life of six teenagers living in Wisconsin through the hippie period.This is without doubt the birthplace of six young talented actors such as Ashton Kutcher, and is considered to be the show with the best cast (consider this is their first acting carrier). The story really captured the sense of the '70s brilliantly and how funky it is to be in that period.Not just that, That '70s Shows also have a brilliant humor throughout and the directing is very original and smart. For me, I think it going to be damn hard to dislike the show.Recommendation: One Of The Most Complete Show, I Have Ever See.Rating: 9/10 (Grade: A+)"
Love & Other Drugs,2010,6.7,"In 1990s Pittsburgh, a medicine peddler starts a relationship with a young woman suffering from Parkinson's disease.","This is one of those movies that have a weird marketing campaign, the studio wants to sell it like a romantic comedy when its more like a drama with complex and real characters. Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyleenhaal have good chemistry on screen and secondary characters help to bring equilibrium to a movie that other way could turn to be a little depressing. I also think that this movie doesn't deserve the R rating just because it deals with sex ( I live in Mexico and here we have something like PG-15)hopefully people don't feel to uncomfortable with the sex scene because it gives more credibility to the story.In the end the film works better than others of its genre and its worth a look ( probably not for a first date) but if you are already on a relationship it will give you something to think and talk about."
He's Just Not That Into You,2009,6.4,This Baltimore-set movie of interconnecting story arcs deals with the challenges of reading or misreading human behavior.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, as did the group of female friends I attended it with. It was well-written, well-acted, and funny.I think the reason some people, er, men, didn't like it was because it portrays some men as lying cheats, others as terrified of intimacy, and some as weirdos. In short, the basic variety any woman runs into on Match.com. Then there were a couple of stand-up guy characters. Were parts of the plot formulaic? Sure. It's a movie. There were a few surprises, however.All of the female characters were likable, which is a switch from standard Hollywood sexism. The acting was above average and I was pleasantly surprised by Scarlett Johannson's performance. I only didn't like Ginnifer Goodwin's slapstick-style performance as a desperate dater. A little subtlety would have made her character more poignant and more believable.The film really does contain a lot of good advice for people in the dating scene, both men and women."
Married with Children,,8.1,"Al is the quintessential working class dad. Peggy, his wife, always wants more from him. With their children, they go through the highs and lows of ordinary life.","""Married with Children"" is the kind of show that does nothing for civilization and has no moral value...yet I got some of the biggest laughs in TV history from this show.  It is still one of my all-time favorites.  I even enjoy watching the repeats over and over again.  That's when you know a show is great.As for Al Bundy, could they have created a funnier TV character than him? He is one of my favorite TV characters, and I sometimes try to imitate him. My friends even jokingly thought of starting a ""No Ma'am"" group of our own. Speaking of ""No Ma'am"" one of my favorite episodes is the one where Al starts his own Church, in order to avoid paying taxes.  He rants and raves like the stereotypical evangelist, only he has two scantily-clad women by his side.  Then Marcy and her feminist group come marching in, showing everyone pictures of Al and Peggy on a romantic date.  Everyone gasps.  In response, Al imitates Jimmy Swaggart by shedding tears and screaming out, ""I have sinned.""  That was genius!  When they one day show a retrospective of the funniest moments in TV history, that scene should definitely be shown. Ed O'Neill plays the character so perfectly, and I was amazed to see that he's actually nothing like his character in real life.  He's a very nice, soft-spoken guy.  Yet he couldn't be any more convincing as that character. Al Bundy will be his legacy!The supporting cast is great.  David Faustino, Christina Applegate, Katey Sagal, David Garrison and Ted McGinley are all very talented.  But I could never understand why Bud had trouble getting girls.  Faustino's a pretty good-looking guy.  Acting-wise, he couldn't be any better, but they could've picked a less attractive actor to have his persona be more convincing.Yes, the show may appear to be misogynistic.  All the female characters are either airheads, whiny housewives or overweight.  But I think in a way it's poking fun at misogynism.  I don't think the show ever glamourizes the act of misogynism.  Just look at the male characters.  They're a bunch of beer-drinking slobs.  Would you want to follow their philosophies on life? But I do admit, I enjoy the presence of many scantily clad babes on each episode.  Hey...if women want to make a show where macho guys appear on every episode in thongs, be my guest!  I won't watch it, but it doesn't offend me.  If women find ""MWC"" offensive, don't watch it!  You have a remote--use it!There are so many memorable moments on the show that I will have to take up this whole message board to jot them all down.  I will just mention two:When Peggy painted the bathroom pink and made it girly-looking, and Al was frightened at the sight of it.  So when the inspectors came to check it out, Al empties a bag with five sandwiches inside.  The song ""Bad to the Bone"" plays as Al scarfs down every sandwich, drowning each one with hot sauce. He grabs a newspaper, tucks it under his arm and runs straight to the bathroom.  The inspectors come running out, the toilet flushes and Al leaves the bathroom proudly.When Al accidentally got circumsized.  He would be afraid to look at anything even mildly stimulating because he was afraid a stitch would break.But as much as I liked the show, I felt good that it was cancelled. Because the last season reeked!!!  I don't know what went wrong, but the writing was drab and contrived, the acting was flat--Al didn't seem like Al anymore! He was actually turning into sort of a nice guy!  The show lost all its energy. But for all the previous seasons, I absolutely adored the show.  And I regard it as a classic!My score:  9 (out of 10)"
All the King's Men,2006,6.1,"Based on the Robert Penn Warren novel. The life of populist Southerner Willie Stark, a political creature loosely based on Governor Huey Long of Louisiana.","I saw this film at the New Orleans premiere and found it to be an interesting spectacle that I largely enjoyed watching. I'm writing to let the public know that the numbers look strange at this point (September 17, 2006). Why? Nearly 20% of the votes have been in the 1-3 range (which would rate this film to be in the ranks of the worst low budget films ever made). One voter has commented that he did not see the film, but hates Sean Penn's politics so he won't see it and will give the film a 1 just to spite Penn. At the same time, nearly half of the votes give the film a perfect 10. I don't think that the polarized ratings to date reflect careful attempts to rate the film. Perhaps that's often the case with IMDb. I suggest taking them with a grain of salt for the time being and deciding for yourself if you are interested in the film."
The Interpreter,2005,6.4,"Political intrigue and deception unfold inside the United Nations, where a U.S. Secret Service agent is assigned to investigate an interpreter who overhears an assassination plot.","Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman) is an UN interpreter. She overhears two men discussing a mysterious plot in an African language. ""The Teacher will never leave this room alive."" Allege war criminal Matobo president Edmond Zuwanie is coming to address the UN General Assembly. She becomes convinced that the threat is against Zuwanie and tells the UN security. U.S. Secret Service Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) and Dot Woods (Catherine Keener) are assigned to protect Zuwanie and they investigate Silvia. It turns out that her family suffered under Zuwanie and she is connected with the opposition.This starts as an interesting thriller with the UN as a backdrop. The political intrigue is somewhat engrossing like a murky 70s thriller. Kidman is cold and Penn is a bit unstable. I wish his character is the protagonist and the audience can unravel the intrigue from the outside. Kidman's character is better with mystery. The movie should keep some distance from her. The audience should keep guessing about her. I do have a few questions about the ending and it drags on a bit too long. It should probably use an alternate ending."
New Year's Eve,2011,5.6,The lives of several couples and singles in New York City intertwine over the course of New Year's Eve.,"I rather enjoy the odd ensemble comedy such as this film, I somewhat enjoyed Valentines Day and I really enjoyed He's Just Not That Into You, but what those film had but this doesn't is a fewer amount of plot lines. There's just too much going on in this film, far too many characters, as soon as I found myself interested in one plot its segment would end, you can never get really attached to one set of characters.For me the best storyline was the Michelle Pfieffer and Zefron plot, it was really the only one with a bit of substance, I actually think a full movie of that story would be great, also the Jessica Biel and Seth Meyers plot was rather funny thanks to the highly underrated Ms Biel. This movie is entertaining enough I suppose but it's also lacking any real great laugh out loud moments, the only time I laughed was when Jessica Biel was in labour, she could do some great comedy if given the chance.Lea Michele manages to bring her great screen charisma to the big screen, she is very fun to watch and her rendition of Aude Lang Syne was lovely and a nice way to end the movie.If this movie had about four or five less stories happening this movie would have been much better, it's not horrible by any standards but it's not excellent either, also this may sound mean but Sofia Vergara is possibly the most annoying actress alive, at least they didn't put a decent actress in the most annoying role in the film. I mean it's worth paying to see the excellent dance scene between Zefron and Pfieffer over the end credits.OK, but basically it's exactly the same as Valentines Day but with more actors and a lot less substance.Enjoy. Maybe."
Meet the Spartans,2008,2.8,"A spoof of 300 (2006) and many other movies, TV series/shows/commercials, video games and celebrities. King Leonidas of Sparta and his army of 12 go to war against Xerxes of Persia to fight to the death for Sparta's freedom.","Was this a bad movie? Compellingly bad. So bad that you have to see what comes next. There are more gay jokes in this flick than can be found in a double feature of ""The Bird Cage"" and ""The Torch Singer"". Were the Spartans homosexuals? Duh! Why did I like this movie? ""Meet the Spartans"" was a structure-free movie, possibly made without a script. Each joke must stand on its own and does. Throughout is the best imitation of Leonidas I can imagine, saying things that I never thought would leave the actor's mouth.This movies isn't Airplane, but it is funny. More than funny, it is fun. Anyone that can fit spiderman into a movie about ancient Greece isn't all bad..."
Superhero Movie,2008,4.7,"Orphaned high school student Rick Riker is bitten by a radioactive dragonfly, develops super powers (except for the ability to fly), and becomes a hero.","In a world of parodies that are just complete trash with a funny moment or two, this one is pretty dang good!! This movie parodies Spiderman (the Raimi/McGuire movies) with some other Marvel characters thrown into the mix.Rick is a nobody high schooler who wants to impress the girl living next door. While on a school trip to a science lab, Rick is bitten by a genetically enhanced Dragonfly, and begins to show superhuman abilities. Will he become the hero his city needs?As I said, this movie is plenty entertaining, witha great cast, and it actually doesn't rely solely on on trash humor (although there is a lil bit). I'd give it a 6.2 rating."
Sex and the City,2008,5.7,"Carrie is finally getting married to her Mr. Big, but heartbreak ensues when an observation by Miranda inadvertently causes him to jilt her.","'Sex and the City,' based on the hilarious, poignant HBO comedy series of the same name, is grossly insulting. In a strong divorce from the series, the movie picks up five years after the series finale - where we find out that each one of the characters have become vapid, soulless versions of their former selves. Now, writer Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker), and her friends Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon), Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall), and Charlotte Goldenblatt (Kristen Davis) walk around New York obsessing over shoes, handbags, and love.Carrie Bradshaw was, at the end of the show, an independent woman - not the needy girl she started out as. The movie turns it's back on Carrie's development as a character, shaping her into the stock romcom lead. Think Katherine Heigl with no charm. She is now painfully unfunny, shallow, and quite possibly retarded. She spends the first half the film setting herself up to have the man whom supposedly loves her jilt her - which he does. The second half of the film, Carrie spends complaining about literally everything, dying her hair brown, and discussing bags and love with a painfully useless, annoying Jennifer Hudson, as Carrie's new assistant Louise from Saint Louis.CARRIE: ""Louise from Saint Louis. Oh you brought me back to life."" LOUISE: ""And you gave me, Louise Vuitton.""Yes the writer of ""The Real Me"" and ""A Woman's Right To Shoes"" actually wrote this garbage.Lawyer Miranda is now a frigid shrew who swats her deadbeat husband away like a fly every time he tries to get near her - and spends the entire 2.5 hours complaining about how marriage changed her, it made her move to Brooklyn. She is no longer likable, funny, or smart.Meanwhile, housewife Charlotte spends the 2.5 hours prancing around like a little girl, screaming at the top of her lungs, and carrying her confused, Asian daughter around like a dog in a handbag. The problem with continuing Charlotte's storyline on the show is her storyline came to the only logical conclusion it could have had at the end of the show. Now, it' just a retread through old territory. Davis is ultimately given a thankless role in this film.However, it is Samantha who is given the most honest adaptation. While certainly a cartoon version of her former self, Samantha's story revolves around her inability to maintain a monogamous relationship - despite being very much in love. However the payoff is ultimately ruined as Samantha is no longer human.This incarnation of 'Sex' is so incredibly shallow - it basically acts a prop to advertise luxury goods. The most obvious scenes to illustrate this are when Carrie tries on designer wedding dresses for a Vogue shoot, which goes on for an excruciating 10 minutes, followed closely by Carrie and co. going through her closet trying to decide what to take to her new apartment with husband-to-be Big (Chris Noth). The scene is ultimately pointless as she is moving to a closet that is 10 times to the size - which, if you can imagine it - is actually a plot point in a film that will make you feel compelled to throw out every designer label you own. The show was about the importance of following your own trajectory, and self actualization. The film abandons this concept."
Resident Evil,2002,6.6,"A special military unit fights a powerful, out-of-control supercomputer and hundreds of scientists who have mutated into flesh-eating creatures after a laboratory accident.","I originally watched ""Resident Evil"" at a movie theater when it was first released in 2002. I hadn't played the games. There was no Rotten Tomatoes and I didn't read reviews back then so I went in blind. And I utterly enjoyed the movie: the story, the action sequences, the underground ""Hive,"" Mila Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez kicking serious ass, and more.Panned by critics (36% RT) but liked by users (67% RT), Resident Evil was one of the first examples of how mainstream critics just don't ""get"" horror. Movies that try to be artsy get great reviews even as key elements fall flat for the rest of us. The recent ""Beach House"" is a perfect example of this -- it was loved by critics (81% RT) and panned by users (28%).Unfortunately, the rest of the ""Resident Evil"" sequels except for a few moments, rarely captured that first movie's originality and allure. Instead, check out the writer/director's excellent previous outing ""Event Horizon."""
Resident Evil: Retribution,2012,5.3,Alice fights alongside a resistance movement to regain her freedom from an Umbrella Corporation testing facility.,"I was eagerly looking forward to the 5th installment of this series and I am sorry to say that I have been really let down! Apart from the once in a while visuals, the movie has not been able to get even close to expectations. The first 10 minutes of the movie and you will start feeling disconnected from the movie already not caring at all what is gonna happen in the next scene. After resident evil 3 & 4, I was expecting a lot out of this installment and from Paul W.S. Anderson but he has not been able to live up the mark at all. The action scenes rather than being nail-biting, turned out to be hilarious and funny. There isn't a single moment in the movie where you are actually glued to screen. Milla Jovovich looks pretty as always, but that won't save the movie. All others have done a horrible job with their acting, especially Sienna Guillory. I would say that the only reason you would want to watch this movie is if you are a fan of the resident evil series and you don't mind wasting your money and time for the sake of this series."
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol,2011,7.4,"The IMF is shut down when it's implicated in the bombing of the Kremlin, causing Ethan Hunt and his new team to go rogue to clear their organization's name.","Reviewers say 'Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol' received mixed opinions. Many praised the thrilling action, impressive stunts, and engaging plot. Tom Cruise's performance and dedication were highlighted, along with Simon Pegg's comedic relief and cast chemistry. However, some criticized the predictable plot, weak villain, and over-the-top action. A few found it dull and lacking substance. Despite criticisms, most found it an entertaining addition to the series."
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs,2009,6.9,"When Sid's attempt to adopt three dinosaur eggs gets him abducted by their real mother to an underground lost world, his friends attempt to rescue him.","Not a bad flick. I don't remember liking the first one, skipped the second one and the only reason I went to see this one was because it was a ""sneak preview"" that started right after the movie I had gone to see and it was in 3D. I recommend seeing this one in 3D as it was worth the extra couple dollars. I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The story was really stupid and didn't make any sense (dinosaurs living under the ice???), but it kept me interested the entire movie, partly because of the hilarious side story with the acorn loving animal and an excellent job by Simon Pegg as Buck the weasel(I just got done watching his TV show ""Spaced"" so maybe I am a little partial), who I had no idea was going to be in the movie. This movie also did a wonderful job of keeping everyone in the audience interested. The theater was packed and the only things you heard besides the movie was popcorn chomping and laughter, lots of laughter. Definitely worth seeing at the theater."
Charlie Wilson's War,2007,7.0,"A drama based on Texas congressman Charlie Wilson's covert dealings in Afghanistan, where his efforts to assist rebels in their war with the Soviets have some unforeseen and long-reaching effects.","It doesn't happen very often, but occasionally one man can make a difference -- a big difference.George Crile's 2003 best seller, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR, is a fascinating and eye-opening account of the most unlikely ""difference maker"" imaginable. A relatively obscure Congressman from the Second District of Texas, ""Good Time Charlie"" was known more for his libertine lifestyle than his libertarian legislation. Likable and licentious (even for a politician), Charlie Wilson served his constituency well since the good folks of Lufkin only really wanted two things, their guns and to be left alone. It's Easy Street replete with his bevy of beltway beauties known, appropriately enough, as Charlie's Angels.When asked why his entire office staff was composed of attractive, young aides his response is a classic, ""You can teach 'em to type, but you can't teach 'em to grow tits."" No argument there.But even the most rakish rapscallion has a conscience lurking somewhere underneath, and for Charlie Wilson the unimaginable atrocities being committed in Afghanistan moved him to muster his entire political savvy toward funding the utter, humiliating defeat of the Russian military and, possibly, to even help hasten the end of the Cold War as a result. Fat chance, huh?Under the skillful direction of Mike Nichols and a smart, snappy screenplay by Adam Sorkin, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR is a sparkling, sophisticated satire that chronicles the behind-the- scene machinations of three colorful characters comprising ""Charlie's Team.""The on-screen ""Team,"" is composed of three marvelous actors with four (4) Academy Awards and nine (9) nominations between them. Charlie is beautifully portrayed by Tom Hanks in a solid, slightly understated fashion that is among his best work in years. He's aided, abetted and abedded by Joanne Herring, a wealthy Houston socialite played by the still-slinky Julia Roberts. Hey, why else have the bikini scene than to let the world know this? By all accounts Ms. Roberts looks good and holds her own, but the screenplay never gives us even a hint why Kabul and country is so important to her character. Maybe the two Afghan hounds usually by her side know -- but we as an audience never do. As for the third member of the ""Team,"" Philip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene he appears in as Gust Aurakotos, a smart, street- wise (i.e. non Ivy League graduate) CIA malcontent who knows the score -- both in the Agency's boardroom and in Wilson's bedroom.For the Mujahideen to succeed, the most important assistance the U.S. can provide is the ability to shoot down the dreaded MI-21 helicopter gunships which rule the skies. This takes money, lots of money, and eventually ""Charlie's Team"" covertly coerces those in Congress to fund the effort to the tune of $1 billion dollars for advanced weaponry to arm the Afghan rebels. This includes top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art anti-aircraft and anti-tank rockets as well as other highly sophisticated killing devices. Nasty, nasty stuff.That this kind of multi-billion dollar illicit activity can and does take place behind Congressional doors is truly alarming. Every American should see this movie or read this book because it reveals a truly frightening aspect of the business-as-usual political scene rarely seen outside the walls of our very own government. Oh momma, I wish it weren't so...Even though the initial outcome for ""Team Charlie"" was an unqualified success, the unimaginable, unanticipated final result is that these sophisticated weapons are now used against our troops by the Taliban and others. Since the funding was entirely ""covert,"" the young generation in this part of the world has no idea the fall of Soviet oppression and the end to Russian barbarity was the direct result of American intervention. Yes, once the Russkies left, so did our aid -- zip for schools, zip for infrastructure, zip on maintaining meaningful relationships with the Afghan people. As a result, the overall consequence is an unmitigated disaster -- it's like the forerunner to ""Mission Accomplished.""As Nichol's film so pointedly points out, ""The ball you've set in motion can keep bouncing even after you've lost interest in it."" Mike Krzyzewski knows this, Eva Longoria Parker knows this, little Lateesha in Lafayette knows this, but the typical American politician doesn't. So we go from good guys to bad guys because we couldn't let the world know we were the good guys. Talk about a Catch-22 (another Mike Nichols film).Perhaps Charlie Wilson said it best, ""We f&%ked up the end game.""Again."
Extract,2009,6.1,"Joel, the owner of an extract plant, tries to contend with myriad personal and professional problems, such as his potentially unfaithful wife and employees who want to take advantage of him.","""Extract"" works well with a majority of its audience. Reason is clear...the cast is very good, story is not boring or cheap; comedy is neither vulgar nor downright stupid; at ~90 minutes it doesn't bore anyone and it has a happy ending!!! Cast wise, a very good job. Jason Bateman plays the sex-deprived businessman role very well. Mila Kunis looks hot throughout the movie and that's exactly what her character was all about. Ben Affleck has a small but a very funny role. JK Simmons hardly does anything wrong about his acting. Others are good in their context.The best thing about ""Extract"" is that the humor is maintained throughout the movie. It's neither cheap vulgar comedy nor downright stupid comedy. The comedy is an elaborate mix of these two poles and that's why this movie is like able. All the characters seem to be performing on a high wire and carry themselves very naturally. There is never a dull moment taking into account the short running time. Besides, the soundtrack is so cool. Really lovely songs.Overall, ""Extract"" is a good movie. Can't say it's a very good movie, but still I can guarantee few smiles for sure.My Verdict: 7/10"
Jersey Girl,2004,6.2,A widower must look after his precocious daughter and rebuild his life and career after he's sidelined by an unexpected tragedy and a personal blowup.,"In New York, the young executive Oliver ""Ollie"" Trinke (Ben Affleck) is a successful PR of the music industry. He meets and falls in love for Gertrude Steiney (Jennifer Lopez), who soon gets pregnant. However, she dies in the childbirth and Ollie decides to return to his father's home in New Jersey. Pressed by the situation of lonely father, the workaholic Ollie blows-up in an important press conference and makes a fatal statement, losing his job and becoming blacklisted in his publicist career. He promises to be the ""best father in the world"" to the young Gertie, and stays single, grieving his beloved wife, without dating any woman for seven years and trying to retrieve a position of public relation. One day, he meets the rental clerk Maya (Liv Tyler), they become friends and she helps him to supersede his past life.""Jersey Girl"" is a very sweet movie about family, and honestly I could never expect such sensitive story from Kevin Smith. I like his work a lot, and I have all his movies in my collection. ""Clerks"" and ""Chasing Amy"" are amazing, and I must confess that I was tired of ""Jay and Silent Bob"". The shift in his career could not be better. The story is great and very well balanced with drama, comedy and romance. Liv Tyler is fantastic, showing a great chemistry with Ben Affleck. George Carlin is great, without being corny, in the role of Bart Trinke. But the girl Raquel Castro is stunning: very bright and smart, she steals all the scenes and seems to be a future star. I really loved this movie. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Menina dos Olhos"" (""Apple of the Eyes"" ¬ñ meaning something very dear"")"
A Late Quartet,2012,7.1,"Members of a world-renowned string quartet struggle to stay together in the face of death, competing egos, and insuppressible lust.","This movie grabs you from the get go with its unique tone and story. Even though it revolves so much about classic music and instruments you don't need too be a fan of that to enjoy this beautiful story about friendship, family, sacrifice and love.This is a well crafted story but make no mistake it get's knocked out of the park by the heavyweights of acting. Keener, Hoffman and Walken bring out the best in each other making every scene special and just when you think a scene was that great of a performance you'll get another one and another one until you realize just like them that things don't last forever."
Midnight Run,1988,7.5,"A bounty hunter pursues a former Mafia accountant who is also being chased by a rival bounty hunter, the F.B.I., and his old mob boss after jumping bail.","Oh yeah!  THE film of the 80's.  Together with HEAT, one of De Niro's best!Totally professional film-making. This is a comedy that succeeds on every level. The central characters of reluctant and burnt-out Bounty Hunter De Niro and Grodin as ex mafia accountant on-the-run ""The Duke,"" just meld flawlessly. The script is wicked with ramped up profanities that somehow are absolutely integral to the unfolding plot. De Niro has just hours to get Grodin back to bail-bondsman Pantoliano while his ex-boss Dennis Farina (COULD anyone look more mafioso?) wants him back for reasons of extreme revenge....Perhaps on account of the fact that The Duke has put his funds to better use a la Robin Hood style of redistribution of wealth.This is really laugh-out-loud brilliant stuff.  Catch it."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,2013,7.5,Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark become targets of the Capitol after their victory in the 74th Hunger Games sparks a rebellion in the Districts of Panem.,"I think this instalment was the best movie in the series. It has the perfect balance of action and storyline. It expands the world with more backstory and characters, and the effects were better so it was more convincing and we felt like we were part of this world. The casting was quite fitting."
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,2006,6.6,"Number one NASCAR driver Ricky Bobby stays atop the heap thanks to a pact with his best friend and teammate, Cal Naughton, Jr. But when a French Formula One driver, makes his way up the ladder, Ricky Bobby's talent and devotion are put to the test.","If you're in the right mood, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is absolutely hilarious. This NASCAR parody takes plenty of laps around the track of ridiculousness in order to get some laughs. It's obvious that Adam McKay just let the actors do and say whatever they wanted take after take until he found something he thought was funny. And there are plenty of quotable moments from this movie. That being said, this movie is an acquired taste, and the outlandish story & acting are sure to annoy some. I was glad to ride with Ricky Bobby once again, but I didn't find it as funny as I used to."
Sex and the City 2,2010,4.5,"While wrestling with the pressures of life, love, and work in Manhattan, Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte join Samantha for a trip to Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates), where Samantha's ex is filming a new movie.","This movie was unnecessary once again. I get it. These characters are fun characters and people like watching them interact but i just once again feel like there was nothing to be said once again.The glaring issue is this movie is also too long. 2 and a half hours! That is 5 times the run time of a single episode of the original series. That is a big jump and i don't think it works especially when then story isn't there to support the long run time.I actually found this movie slightly funnier than the previous but only by a slight margin. But i just couldn't get past the blah-ness.Kim Cattrall is great as always but why she is also great is she's the only thing stopping them making a third movie, so good on her. They would keep making them because like i said people love these characters, i do too but i don't want to see them just like flounder around the screen not growing or developing. I said it in the last review that these characters have plateaued. They have reached their end and big surprise they ended once again where we started with them.I do want to mention the start of this movie because it was the strangest thing id seen all week, Liza Minelli singing Single Ladies. That maybe even be enough to make the film watchable."
Dogma,1999,7.3,An abortion clinic worker with a special heritage is called upon to save the existence of humanity from being negated by two renegade angels trying to exploit a loop-hole and reenter Heaven.,"Dogma has plenty of funny religion-themed gags, but I was entertained by it mainly because I liked just about all of the characters and I enjoyed most of their dialogue.There's not a lot of substance behind what they're saying, unlike in, say, Tarantino's films, but the fact that it's all fairly low-brow and goofy is what makes it good. Jay and Bob are fantastic with their little stoner quips.The plot is fairly weak, but it's not supposed to be brilliant. It's easy to tell that Kevin Smith just enjoys playing around with Catholicism by poking and prodding at it.Also, George Carlin is what was his usual comedic self in his cameo."
Zack and Miri Make a Porno,2008,6.5,"Lifelong platonic friends Zack and Miri look to solve their respective cash-flow problems by making an adult film together. As the cameras roll, however, the duo begin to sense that they may have more feelings for each other than they previously thought.","Lifelong platonic friends Zack and Miri live together but struggle week to week to make ends meet and keep the bills paid. When they get their water and power cut off on the night they are stumped as to how they are going to get out from under. At the same time a viral video of Miri in her large pants (aka ""granny pants"") reveals that they have some weird sort of online fame already ¬ñ a fame they are keen to exploit. Their plan? Well, get a group of locals together, rent a camera and get some basic sets and make themselves an amateur pornographic film. It is all business of course, but will even ""performance"" sex complicate Zack and Miri's relationship?I live in a first floor flat on a busy junction in a part of Birmingham and, as well as being a cool place to be, I do get lots of direct marketing from the film posters on the buses going by within about 5m and just below my window level. This was not a particularly pleasant thing when I had to content with Rogen's goofy face every 5 minutes when this film was released ¬ñ I'm not a big fan of him and I find him to be pretty one note but just happened to come along at the right time. However I was interested enough in Kevin Smith to go and check it out to see if he had managed to get better. It was no surprise (given the title) to find that he had certainly not grown up anymore because this is a film that relies heavily on crude jokes and sexual references above everything else.This does the job for quite a while because the film is sporadically funny in a childish way. I suppose it will depend who you are because some people love this sort of thing whereas for me, it was just too obvious and forced ¬ñ even if I still found it quite amusing. It wears off though because, talking of obvious and forced, the actual plot is really poor. It is not just that it is predictable (lots of films are ""predictable"" if you think about it) but it is more the way it trudges towards the obvious conclusion without worrying about whether or not the audience care (we don't) or if it rings true (it doesn't). The focus on crude jokes in the first half means that you don't really care about the characters and when Smith decides to go all doe-eyed in his plot then you just don't buy it and it only results in being unfunny and dull.The cast all do the basics and there is only really one ""good"" performance in the film ¬ñ which is from Banks. She has a natural presence which is sort of charming and she does work that well here. She isn't good enough to charm the film into being better (Rosario Dawson sort of managed it in Clerks 2) but she does reasonably well considering what is asked of her. Rogen does his usual stuff ¬ñ if you like that then you will like this but for those who disliked him even once then this is more of the same. Mewes is amusing but his presence only reminds you how much funnier he was as Jay. Long is funny in his small turn and there are a couple of other good comic performances from others in the group as well.Overall this film is just what we have sadly come to expect from Kevin Smith ¬ñ a crude film that is funny but nowhere near funny enough to carry the whole film like he once did. The plot is poor and obvious but this will only irritate in the final third ¬ñ up till then there are at least a hatful of crude laughs to be had if you like that sort of thing."
The Hunger Games,2012,7.2,Katniss Everdeen voluntarily takes her younger sister's place in the Hunger Games: a televised competition in which two teenagers from each of the twelve Districts of Panem are chosen at random to fight to the death.,"Reviewers say 'The Hunger Games' is lauded for Jennifer Lawrence's compelling performance as Katniss and its faithful portrayal of the dystopian themes. However, criticisms arise regarding deviations from the book's plot and character arcs, perceived lack of depth, and the necessity to read the book for full appreciation. Some express disappointment with the pacing, action sequences, and toned-down violence for a PG-13 rating. Despite these issues, many find the film enjoyable and a decent adaptation."
Les Mis√©rables,2012,7.5,"In 19th-century France, Jean Valjean, who, for decades, has been hunted by the ruthless policeman Javert after breaking parole, agrees to care for a factory worker's daughter. The decision changes their lives forever.","Jean Valjean: ""I stole a loaf of bread. My sister's child was close to death, and we were starving."" Javert: ""And you will starve again unless you learn the meaning of the law!""Just as I stood at the end of the stage production of Les Miserables, I stood in my home after watching a screener copy. I was, however, concerned that I would have nothing ""critical' to say about director Tom Hooper's lush film version, filled with first-rate actors believable crowds, and singing befitting non-opera types in a people's opera.Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), mayor of Paris in the first part of the 19th century, promises dying prostitute Fantine (Anne Hathaway) to take care of her daughter, Cosette (Amanda Seyfried). He has been eluding the tireless policeman, Javert (Russell Crowe), after breaking parole for the crime of stealing a loaf of bread, for which he served 19 years. It's not so much the melodrama that grabs me as the inspired music that has discernibly distinct and luscious melodies and a book that straightforwardly tells story and reveals character.Jackman, Hathaway, and Crowe are competent singers, and the better for not being opera stars, who would have compromised the Everyman feel of the musical. For an almost three hour show, Hooper and writer Claude-Michel Schonberg keep the action moving from Javert and Valjean in a battle of wits and the youths fomenting a revolution right outside the windows.For comic relief, Sacha Baron Cohen as Th√©nardier and Helena Bonham Carter as Madame Th√©nardier run a comical whore house and do quite well as pickpockets. At times, their antics are so opposite the grand action outside as to be almost irritating. Les Mis was a thrill on stage; it is a joy on screen as the 19th century comes alive with the poor struggling against the rich and the noble, poor or rich, miserable."
Gone Girl,2014,8.1,The husband of a missing woman becomes the chief suspect in her disappearance.,"Reviewers say 'Gone Girl' is a provocative psychological thriller with mixed opinions. Many praise David Fincher's direction, Rosamund Pike's performance, and its dark themes. Critics commend the film's exploration of marriage and media manipulation. However, some find the plot convoluted and the ending controversial. Pike's performance is often highlighted, though Ben Affleck's role receives varied responses. The film's runtime and pacing are contentious, with some feeling it drags. Overall, it's seen as engaging, though divisive."
Jumanji,1995,7.1,A magic board game summons jungle perils and a missing boy.,"In Bradford, New Hampshire, in 1969, the bullied boy Alan Parrish overhears drumbeats and finds a boarding game called ""Jumanji"" that was buried one hundred years ago by two boys in the real estate of Alan's father Sam Parrish (Jonathan Hyde). Alan plays the game with his sweetheart Sarah Whittle and vanishes while Sarah flees from bats that have arrived in his mansion.In the present days, in 1995, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) moves to the abandoned house that belonged to Sam Parrish with her orphan niece Judy Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter Shepherd (Bradley Pierce) that lost their parents in a car accident in Canada. They hear the drumbeats, find the Jumanji and decide to play the boarding game. They bring giant mosquitoes, monkeys, a lion and Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) back home twenty-six years older. Soon they discover that they need to finish the game to restore everything the way they were. But the game is too dangerous and brings different threats to them and to Bradford while they play.""Jumanji"" is a delightful adventure and family entertainment from the 90's. The story is original and the special effects are still great after twenty years. It is so good to see Robin Williams again and curious to recall Kirsten Dunst still a girl. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Jumanji"""
Ice Age: Continental Drift,2012,6.5,"Manny, Diego, and Sid embark upon another adventure after their continent is set adrift. Using an iceberg as a ship, they encounter sea creatures and battle pirates as they explore a new world.","""Two sloths, a mammoth and a saber... You guys are like a start of a bad joke.""I'm not sure if it is my current depression speaking, or maybe I'm just tired of this franchise, but it seems to me that it slowly recedes. Visually, the film is superbly done, it is interesting and cute and holds the attention, but every next sequel is less funny than the previous, and this time not once have I laughed out loud. Still, I can not point on any other flaws, so I'll rate it7/10"
Cars 2,2011,6.2,Star race car Lightning McQueen and his pal Mater head overseas to compete in the World Grand Prix race. But the road to the championship becomes rocky as Mater gets caught up in an intriguing adventure of his own: international espionage.,"Espionage, assassinations, sabotage of renewable energy, propaganda, corporate cover-ups, media manipulation and The Mob...James Bond? Nope. Jason Bourne? Nope.Disney/Pixar's CARS 2. Wow. This movie wasn't at all what I was expecting. In the second serving of Lightning McQueen and his pals, they take their show to the international stage in a world championship race-off sponsored by oil-alternative manufacturer, Allinol. But turmoil behind the scenes pulls the gang into a world of spies, the Mob, Big Oil, evil German scientists and hit men. Now they have to save the world before it's too late. Oh, and they race too. The animation is amazing. Water, large balloons, backgrounds during races...pay attention because the quality of the graphics in this one are world-class. There are some goofy, funny moments and some nice one- liners for the older crowd. The themes of being true to yourself and bonds of friendship run strong throughout this film but it's the remainder of the message that worried me. There were non-stop put downs throughout and some other questionable topics. I was beginning to question the G rating when the villain ordered his henchmen to ""kill"" several other cars. Thinking back to the innocence and the good spirit of the first movie, I began to wonder how we got from there to here. Adventures in racing take a back-seat to the more mature plot of an espionage thriller. Looking around the theater, I could tell that kids younger than 4 or 5 were beginning to get lost. Even my ten-year-old had a hard time understanding the socio-political messages. On top of all that, I'd be willing to bet that Cars 2 is a contender for most guns, explosions and bullets fired in a G-Rated movie. This movie had much more violence than the first one.Aside from the appropriateness of the movie, it wasn't bad. All the likable characters from the first movie were back with bigger roles like 'Mater & Luigi and there were many new characters added that also brought their own personalities into the mix. To me, this was an espionage-thriller so the added bonus of some comedy made the movie move right along at a good pace.It was engaging for me, I enjoyed it, but the entire time I couldn't help but wonder why Disney/Pixar chose to tell this story through a kids movie."
American Hustle,2013,7.2,"A con man, Irving Rosenfeld, along with his seductive partner Sydney Prosser, is forced to work for a wild F.B.I. Agent, Richie DiMaso, who pushes them into a world of Jersey powerbrokers and the Mafia.",The acting from all round was amazing. I find it very hard to believe that Christian bale didn't win a major award for his role I thought he was the stand out actor in this along side Jennifer Lawrence. It's crazy what Bale puts his body through for roles. The ending was perfect it ended exactly how I wanted it to.
Dolphin Tale 2,2014,6.4,The team of people who saved Winter's life reassemble in the wake of her surrogate mother's passing in order to find her a companion so she can remain at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium.,"""You can't just throw two dolphins in the water together.""And that's basically the only conflict driving the plot for this sequel. I was a huge fan of Charles Martin Smith's first film starring Winter, the dolphin with the prosthetic tail, but there isn't anything appealing about this sequel which barely has a plot. I felt that there was never really much at stake here and many of the emotional moments felt forced, unlike in the first film where there was a lot at stake. There were a lot of fillings and subplots that never did anything to help build the pacing, and despite remaining family friendly, most children will probably be bored by this sequel. I never got engaged with it and perhaps much of that had to do with the weak script and the lack of conflict. The characters which I really liked the first time around didn't do anything for me in this sequel and I didn't feel that same connection they had with Winter this time around. Dolphin Tale 2 has all the right ingredients for a direct to DVD movie, but somehow it has been released in the big screen and received some positive reviews from the critics (only 4% lower than Interstellar according to Rottentomatoes). It astonishes me considering this film is formulaic and predictable with very little going for it. A week from now everyone will forget about it.The true star of the franchise is Winter, but in this sequel we really don't get to see the dolphin all that much. There really isn't much at stake either, and we know how everything is going to play out. The cast is back again, which means we get some cameos from Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd, and Kris Kristofferson, but they aren't given any substantial role this time around. The film centers once again on the child actors, Nathan Gamble and Cozi Zuehlsdorff, who deliver solid performances but don't add much to the story. From the first scene you can tell that the producers were simply trying to cash in after the success of the first film because there is not much going for it story wise. The true story is inspirational and the original film has touched many people's lives, but there wasn't any need for a sequel."
Evan Almighty,2007,5.4,God contacts Congressman Evan Baxter and tells him to build an ark in preparation for a great flood.,"Evan Almighty generated a lot of hype before its release. A lot of people loved Bruce Almighty, and were expecting something just a zany and hilarious in Evan Almighty. Most of them were disappointed: this movie was received negatively by most critics and audiences alike. Well, I liked it! First of all, this movie has been misunderstood, because it was mismarketed. It was marketed as a hilarious sequel to Bruce Almighty (and the trailer made it look that way, too). But, to be perfectly honest, this is more of a family film than a comedy. But it is a really good family film.This film had a lot of potential for comedy. It delivered at times, but not consistently. It also had two very crude toilet humour jokes involving male genitalia (just the word, though, nothing beyond that). I will freely admit, this isn't nearly as hilarious a comedy as the original. But it's good in its own right.Morgan Freeman's scenes as God were excellently written and performed! One scene in particular, in a restaurant, was really touching and moving. Freeman is really a terrific actor, I'm glad they cast him as God. The performances in this movie were, overall, great. (Although it's a lot of fun watching the young kid unable to resist looking into the camera when pointing out two doves to his dad.) So, all in all, Evan Almighty is not ""almighty"" but it's still ""alrighty""."
The Last King of Scotland,2006,7.6,Based on the events of the brutal Ugandan dictator Idi Amin's regime as seen by his personal physician during the 1970s.,"There have been so few pictures this year that are standouts. This movie is one of them. Much of what you will see is true, and did occur in Uganda's history. Amin's doctor, played by James Macavoy, is the main fiction in the movie, but one would think they are watching a historical event. Macavoy's character is so real. The doctor grows from a free thinking, adventure loving, womanizer, to a scared, concerned, and enlightened person. The viewer watches through Macavoys eyes as he witnesses the horrors of Amin's (Forest Whitaker's) presidency and regime.Forest Whitaker, IS Amin in this feature. Whitaker is not the silent sometimes brooding character you remember in other films he has been in. His accent,his face, and his emotions seem to no longer be Whitaker's but Amin's. This movie will scare the viewer because of its realism, and how it builds up to a tension that is hard to endure. The visuals are not for the squeamish. Go ahead and hide your eyes during the ""tough"" scenes. It is still worth seeing this movie for the fast paced story, realistic drama, fascinating tale, and for the unbelievable acting. By the end of the movie the audience is exhausted, but satisfied that they saw a worthy flick."
Michael Clayton,2007,7.2,"A law firm brings in its ""fixer"" to remedy the situation after a lawyer has a breakdown while representing a chemical company that he knows is guilty in a multibillion-dollar class action suit.","In the title role of Michael Clayton, George Clooney is described by himself as exactly that. Whenever there's a big mess he's the one they send in to clean it up. The law firm under managing partner Sydney Pollack has a real mess on his hands. One of the firm's top attorneys Tom Wilkinson has gone off the deep end. He's representing a chemical company accused of poisoning people with a new insecticide they've developed. Cleaning up this mess might be just a baby sitting job with Wilkinson who mentored Clayton. But it has the potential to be worse because this company is guilty as sin and will do anything to limit the liability and keep their good name.Michael Clayton was nominated for a flock of Oscars including Best Actor for George Clooney as a much flawed hero. Takes a while for the better angels of Clooney's nature emerge. Tom Wilkinson as the lawyer with both conscience and schizophrenia steals the acting honors though. He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Michael Clayton got a flock of other nominations including Best Picture.The film did take home one bit of Oscar gold. Tilda Swinton as one of the chemical company executives who also has an attack of conscience got a Best Supporting Actress Award. She's quite good herself.The film is an interesting look at big business and the high priced lawyers they must retain to keep them out of trouble. Sad in some cases we have to rely on consciences coming to the fore for any justice at times.Michael Clayton, a well done piece of cinema."
The Men Who Stare at Goats,2009,6.2,"A reporter in Iraq might just have the story of a lifetime when he meets Lyn Cassady, a guy who claims to be a former member of the U.S. Army's New Earth Army, a unit that employs paranormal powers in their missions.","I'm going to say its definitely up there in the top few films I've seen at the cinema this year. It has been criticised for lacking more biting criticism of the US government, but I think people who are saying that are missing the point. It does have a fair bit to say about how stupid the US Military can be and how they like to blow money on obviously pointless ventures, but there is a whole other side to it.I thought that the film was more about the human spirit and how that if you want to make a difference and want to do something you've got to really go for it no matter how stupid the aim. Obviously the idea of trying to be a psychic spy is unattainable and may sound ludicrous, but so may be the notion of trying to create world peace and help bring different people together over a united cause. The film was more about how these drifters and lost souls managed to find something that they found worthy of pursuing and really devoted themselves to it, and I think this message is more admirable than any side-criticism of the USA.The film plays out mainly as a buddy movie with Geogre Clooney, who is doing his usual comic act very well, and Ewan McGregor as they head around Iraq not really knowing what they are looking for and getting into loads of hilarious antics along the way. I don't think I've laughed so much in the cinema this year, and the whole audience was laughing along as well.I thought the structure was hardly groundbreaking, but done really well. Flashbacks involving Jeff Bridges and Clooney help add comic relief during some of the straighter scenes in the film and also at times are used to rack up the tension and reveal interesting insights. It is of course up to your interpretation if the flashbacks are 100% real, because they are told from the point of view of Ewan McGregor, recounting stories that were told to him by Clooney. This sorts out another common criticism that the film is extremely unrealistic, but there are some key scenes saying that Clooney might not be telling the whole truth that I feel have been overlooked.It isn't going to be Oscar-fare or the greatest thing you'll ever see but with a good cast and a lot of laughs there isn't really going to be a much better way of spending a lazy Saturday afternoon with some popcorn and a buddy or two."
Up in the Air,2009,7.4,"Ryan's job is to travel around the country firing off people. When his boss hires Natalie, who proposes firing people via video conference, he tries to convince her that her method is a mistake.","Seeing the character that George Clooney plays in Up In The Air reminds me of George Peppard in The Carpetbaggers. If you remember Jonas Cord was flying all over creation in his private plane developing and supervising his many enterprises. Just like Clooney here, Peppard had some deep seated issues about settling down even though unlike Clooney he was already married.Clooney has an interesting job that really keeps him moving. He works for a firm that specializes in aiding fired workers make a transition. I can testify myself that getting fired can be traumatic. In my case though my firing lasted two months and I went back to my old job and stayed there until retirement.Clooney's boss Jason Bateman has him going all over the country. He says that he spent only about 43 days in his sparse apartment in Omaha. It really is sparse the various hotel rooms look more homey. But a woman who also spends a lot of time traveling on her job Vera Famiga and a woman who is being trained by Clooney, Anna Kendrick help him see that maybe his life and lack of commitment isn't the best thing for him.Nor is his stated goal of gaining 10 million frequent flier miles. He spends so much time in the air that all the airline personnel on all the airlines know him on a first name basis. That's one significant accomplishment. Maybe Clooney should have taken up with a stewardess.The characters are drawn well in this script which got one of several Academy Award nominations, in this case for adapted screenplay. Up In The Air also got Academy recognition for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor for Clooney, Best Actress for Famigia, and Best Supporting Actress for Kendrick. I thought Kendrick was especially good as the young lady who sees a career treadmill she doesn't like and gets off.Up In The Air is an intelligent and modern comedy with some characters I think we can all identify with."
Fantastic Mr. Fox,2009,7.9,An urbane fox cannot resist returning to his farm raiding ways and then must help his community survive the farmers' retaliation.,"To put it simply, Fantastic Mr. Fox is unlikely to leave you disappointed.For a start, the animation, is simply wonderful. Gorgeously designed backgrounds and scenery full of simply incredible attention to detail, the film is full of such loving care and attention. Each character feels full of personality and it's refreshing to see something other than a glossy 3D rendered animation film for a change most certainly. It feels like a return to a day where a little imagination was expected in films, which is nice.Comparing Pixar releases and this film is besides the point. This film wasn't made to be compared or compete with others, it was made to tell a classic children's tale by one of the greatest authors at writing them. Dahl's wife Felicity herself has described her delight at how the film portrays the universe great author created and the modification of the story for film length is smoothly and smartly done. It is a beautifully told story, heart-warming and charming, witty and full of comedic moments.While Pixar films play like films made for children that can be enjoyed by adults. Wes Anderson's film feels like one made for adults, that can be enjoyed by children. Some parents may not feel too comfortable of the less than subtle replacement of curse words with ""cuss"" or ""cussing"" it has to be mentioned however.The voice acting is excellently done, Anderson took the cast outside, underground and indoors for the varying parts of the film to give it a real feel of authenticity which pays off. The soundtrack, as with all Wes Anderson films, is stunningly good and really elevates the film. After watching you may find yourself searching out the soundtrack as soon as you get home.The film's style and direction screams Wes Anderson at the top of its lungs and so, haters of his previous work may need to be careful, but I would certainly suggest to give the film a try and see if it can convert you, if not at least not make you feel like you've wasted your money.As a self confessed Wes Anderson fan I was doomed to love this film no matter what, but am genuinely delighted with the end product and believe that more than just the blind Wes Anderson lover will find this film a charming, witty ride of enjoyment."
The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,2004,7.2,"With a plan to exact revenge on a legendary shark that killed his partner, oceanographer Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) rallies a crew that includes his estranged wife, a journalist, and a man who may or may not be his son.","I find this a hard movie to rate. Maybe a second viewing would make it easier. It's a odd film: one of these low-key black humor films which is a mixture of drama and comedy. What set this apart were a few other shocking scenes of violence, something not normally in this type of movie. For a comedy, albeit a tongue-in-cheek one, that violence doesn't seem to fit, but it makes the film all the more intriguing.At times I was totally bored with this movie and at other times fascinated. I know one thing: this is a bizarre story! That automatically means it's a good vehicle for Bill Murray, who excels at wacky characters, event he low-key ones as he sometimes plays (i.e. Lost In Translation, The Royal Tenebaums, etc.). Speaker of the latter, this movie was written and directed by Wes Anderson, the same man who did ""Tenenbaums."" If you saw that, you have an idea of what you might get here, although I thought Royal Tenenbaums was far funnier.At 118 minutes, this a bit long for what it offers. I'd like to have seen it 15 minutes shorter with a tighter script. But it does offer some good photography in addition to the strange story. This movie, as they say, is not for all tastes."
Bad Teacher,2011,5.7,"A lazy, incompetent middle school teacher who hates her job, her students, and her co-workers is forced to return to teaching to make enough money for breast implants after her wealthy fianc√© dumps her.","You'd think this sort of humour would be right up my street, and you'd be absolutely correct. The sneering at the well-intentioned, the relentless mocking of the disadvantaged, and the courage to show us sometimes nice guys (or gals) DO finish last is like ambrosia to my ears.However, I can't help but compare and contrast to a similar film by the name of Bad Santa, and not just because of the name. Both movies have alcoholic, drug-addled losers in the main role who are only in their current job for personal satisfaction. They steal, cheat and manipulate every good soul around them to achieve their goal, before finding some sort of minor personal redemption by the end.But unlike the Xmas film, Bad Teacher operates to so many extremes of what it mocks it all becomes a wee bit improbable. No-one for instance, could be as sickly-sweet as Lucy Punch's character in real life... you can tell this is a comic creation all the way, and she plays it too broadly. Same with Justin Timberlake.... they make him so obnoxiously nice in his part, he is never that funny, just plain irritating. And he ditches that persona entirely for a startlingly bad dry-humping scene late on, the less said about the better.Thank Heaven for Cameron Diaz though... She might be damaging children's delicate mental health with her corruptible influence, but at least she's a fleshed out person. All the humorous moments flow through her and her utter disdain for the goody two shoes surrounding her. A school like this, with it's right-on attitude and it's stultifying political correctness would probably be more of a nightmare to attend than a little place I know called Potterspury Lodge.It's just a shame then, that unlike the slightly superior Bad Santa, sometimes it just gets so OTT that it crosses the line between satire and silliness. It's still generally a chucklesome affair, but I just feel like it could have been better. Ah, well... 6/10"
Interstellar,2014,8.7,"When Earth becomes uninhabitable in the future, a farmer and ex-NASA pilot, Joseph Cooper, is tasked to pilot a spacecraft, along with a team of researchers, to find a new planet for humans.","Reviewers say 'Interstellar' is acclaimed for its ambitious themes, breathtaking visuals, and emotional depth, with standout performances by Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway. The film delves into complex scientific ideas, love, and humanity's role in the cosmos, enhanced by Hans Zimmer's score. However, some find the plot convoluted, question scientific accuracy, and criticize pacing and length. Despite these issues, 'Interstellar' is celebrated as a significant and thought-provoking science fiction film."
The Notebook,2004,7.8,An elderly man reads to a woman with dementia the story of two young lovers whose romance is threatened by the difference in their respective social classes.,"Reviewers say 'The Notebook' is celebrated for its heartfelt depiction of love, with standout performances by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. The film's themes of sacrifice, time, and love's power deeply resonate. However, some find it overly sentimental, formulaic, and lacking originality. Critics also point to the predictable plot and unrealistic relationship portrayal. Despite these drawbacks, many viewers appreciate its emotional impact and touching tribute to love."
My Sister's Keeper,2009,7.3,Anna Fitzgerald looks to earn medical emancipation from her parents who until now have relied on their youngest child to help their leukemia-stricken daughter Kate remain alive.,"One of the most interesting movie going experiences came when toward the end of this film, the noise of someone blowing their nose filled the theater. A soft giggle then filled the theater. I hate to say that this is one of ""those movies,"" where you know there's a chance that you might end up in tears by the end, but I'm afraid it's true. The struggle between life and death, not only for middle child Kate, but also for the whole family, is heartwarming. Cameron Diaz, takes a serious turn, somehow she seems very comfortable in this role. And Sofia Vassilieva shows both sides of cancer. The heartache and the pain, but also the beauty in how tragedy can bring families together."
P.S. I Love You,2007,7.0,A young widow discovers that her late husband has left her 10 messages intended to help ease her pain and start a new life.,"Holly (Hillary Swank) has been married for a number of years to handsome Gerry (Gerard Butler), an Irish gentleman. Wed at 19, he is the only love of her life and they have big plans for the future. Sadly, however, Gerry is stricken with cancer and dies, leaving Holly desolate. But, much to her surprise, letters start arriving from Gerry, under unusual circumstances, letters that provide encouragement for Holly to move forward with her life. Gerry suggests that Holly do some karaoke and take a trip to Ireland, where she should learn to fish and visit his relatives. It doesn't' hurt that Holly has two loving friends (Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon), a hovering mother (Kathy Bates), and a good-looking new friend (Harry Connick, Jr.) looking out for her, also. But, can Holly truly overcome the serious blow that life has given her? This is a sweet movie but, I must confess, I was a wee bit disappointed. Yes, I loved the basic story and the cast is beyond terrific. Swank is quite nice as the young widow while Butler is greatly engaging as the husband, with many of his scenes told in flashback. In fact, Butler is a new favorite among American women, thanks to Dear Frankie, and let us all hope we see much more of him. Kudrow, Gershon, Bates, Connick Jr., and some of the Irish players are just right, too, breathing more life into a script that is erratic and sometimes contrived. Of course, the sets in Manhattan and Ireland are very wonderful, as are the costumes and great camera work. But, the film could have used more careful direction and editing, in my view. However, all fans of romantic comedy should not miss it, no. As the fountain of romcom films has considerably dried up in the last two years, any new entry is a hearty meal for the starving. Just do not expect another Music and Lyrics this time around."
The Expendables,2010,6.4,A CIA operative hires a team of mercenaries to eliminate a Latin dictator and a renegade CIA agent.,"Watching this movie was a great experience for an 80's movie buff like me. Its like the advertisement for it says, it has everyone! It says a lot for Sylvester Stallone's toughness that he can still play a tough guy part when he is one year from collecting Social Security. It really tickled me seeing the cameos by Bruce Willis and ""The Governator"". Its sort of an inside joke, he and Stallone have always had a friendly rivalry. Mickey Rourke really steals the show in his few scenes as a former mercenary turned tattoo artist. He delivers a rambling speech at one point about losing your soul that is really oddly moving in a way. Director Stallone has the camera dwell on his battered features as he delivers it. The awesome special effects, loud explosions and familiar faces sort of blur the fact that the plot from this movie could have easily been an old A Team episode. There really isn't much of one. But who am I to quibble? This movie is a great way to round out the summer."
The Expendables 2,2012,6.6,"Mr. Church reunites the Expendables for what should be an easy paycheck, but when one of their men is murdered on the job, their quest for revenge puts them deep in enemy territory and up against an unexpected threat.","I disagree with some people feeling that this film was no better than the first. It is easily better than the first, which is a very hard thing to do (normally). I thought the first movie wasn't brill but it was OK, it was kind of what I expected but I did expect a bit more in the fight scenes and I felt that Jet Lei just like the story wasn't up to much. Everything Stallone is doing here is a great idea and it has a great feel to it. Expendables 2 has finally got to where the first one should've been. This one is far more enjoyable, the action / fight scenes are better, which is mainly why we watch these sorts of films, but also the characters and their relationships with each other are better. Some of the scenes are pure genius. Some of the scenes are not but hey ho. I am really looking forward to a 3rd instalment but I do feel that they will take it too far and end up with some of the most annoying and worst ones appearing like Steven Seagal and Vin Deisel... I hope not! If they do then they might as well go the whole hog and get the Heather Small bird from M People on there to just totally annoy us all!!Expendables 2... Anyone who is between the age of 30 and 60 that remembers the best 80's action flicks with the likes of Arnie, Stallone, Bruce Willis, van damme in will know that these films didn't ever really have great acting in, it was all about the action and the fight scenes. Expendables 2 has got it going on! Really enjoyable film."
Crank,2006,6.9,Professional assassin Chev Chelios learns his rival has injected him with a poison that will kill him if his heart rate drops.,"A feature film that puts Jason Statham in the front is more or less destined to be action-packed from the beginning to the end and Crank is not an exception. At first glance the duration of 1h30min might seem as pretty standard but I experienced the film to be somewhat longer due to its high pace. Trust me, 1h30min of this roller-coaster adrenaline chase is enough and I do not mean it in a negative way - I would not like to see the flick shorter nor any longer as it is perfect as it is! Anyone who has grown a predilection for Statham's acting ought to see this one. I can imagine that fans of films such as Snatch and Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels will love this one. Noteworthy is that I perceived the pace of Crank to be somewhat higher than the pace of the other films previously mentioned. Crank brings about violence, drugs, sex and even more violence, so sensitive viewers may want to take caution. Crank is not just another film depicting fast-cut scenes of violence, however, and I believe it as a lot more to offer the cinema-goers than just stimulating their thirst for violence. The film is very original indeed and it is a good piece of contemporary challenging film since it is not flirting with all the conventions of the genre, I believe.7/10 - well worth a try!"
How the Grinch Stole Christmas,2000,6.4,"On the outskirts of Whoville lives a green, revenge-seeking Grinch who plans to ruin Christmas for all of the citizens of the town.","The Grinch hates Christmas, then steals it!When this first came out I liked the original version much more, but as time goes on I'm finding myself preferring this version more and more. Perhaps it's because Jim Carey's portrayal is more relatable, or perhaps I'm more impressed with the visuals and production value than I once was, or maybe I just understand the adult jokes more. Whatever the reason, this is a fantastic adaptation.What stands out above all is Jim Carey's performance, followed by the sets and costumes. It is an unforgettable experience that might never be replicated again.While kids may prefer the original, certainly this will be all the adults most preferred version of the Grinch."
The Santa Clause,1994,6.6,"When a man inadvertently makes Santa fall off his roof on Christmas Eve, he finds himself magically recruited to take his place.","I remember the first time I saw the trailer for The Santa Clause. It was during the previews for The Lion King. As soon as the camera panned up from the snow globe to reveal Tim Allen, all the people in the theater began to laugh. This is a great, wholesome, funny flick that grown-ups and kidlets both can enjoy. Tim Allen was perfect to play the dad who becomes Santa, and I love when he burned the roast! I also thought the actor who played Bernard the elf was very funny and stole every scene he was in. And I especially enjoyed Judge Reinhold's turn as Neal Miller. I love the scene where he finally gets the hot dog whistle he'd wanted since he was a kid! Great holiday fun!"
Arthur Christmas,2011,7.1,Santa's clumsy son Arthur sets out on a mission with Grandsanta to give out a misplaced present to a young girl in less than two hours on Christmas Day.,"This film should be a certain addition to any classic christmas film collection. As always, Ardman took their time on this animated picture and it cannot be faulted. The fantastic cast of experienced British actors really help make the comedy and light-heartedness of the film which is dotted with jokes to make adults laugh too. The story is very straightforward but the way it gets from start to end includes enough unexpecetd turns to keep a watcher engaded. Ends in a greatly happy note."
The Santa Clause 2,2002,5.8,"Scott Calvin has been a humble Santa Claus for eight years, but it might come to an end if he doesn't find a Mrs. Claus.","Now, I cannot really describe what sort of expectations I had coming into this movie. I barely remember the first Santa Clause, which came out over six years ago, so the idea of a sequel after such a long break made me rethink its possibilities. Then my family and I went to go see it today, and for what it is worth, SC2 is pretty decent. Okay, so there isn't a lot of humor that will appeal to the older siblings or parents in the audience, but the colorful sets, simple story, and a good cast make it worth the trip. Tim Allen is just fine as Santa, although for such a good comedian I was hoping he would improvise some more sly humor or gags into the role. One wonders what Robin Williams or, heck, Chris Rock could do with the role of the big guy. The woman who plays Allen's possible love interest was also pretty good, but her character fell in love with Scott Calvin so fast it seemed like the script was forcing the relationship. Pretty much everyone from 1996's Santa Clause is back, including Charlie, who is now all grown up and as cute as a button. They try to present him as somehwhat of a delinquent, but considering all he does is throw snowballs and do a little light grafitti work, it seems like he's more of a Disney thug than anything you would see on the streets of reality. The only actor I could have nixed from the film and not missed was the chubby kid who was also in Bruce Willis' The Kid and provided voicework for the Peter Pan sequel. It just feels like Disney is recycling him into every movie they have, and he isn't even that good of a child actor. Oh, and did anyone catch the insanely obvious product placement for McDonald's? Sheesh, I have a problem with such blatant advertising like this, but at the same time it is kind of funny to watch the Marketing Gears groan and grind (look, Charlie is having a BIG MAC). Oh, and the reindeer character eats a lot of brand name candy (including a yummy CRUNCH BAR). I liked Comet, even if he is an obvious animatronic creation, and appreciated the fact that the filmakers didn't get lazy and just use CGI, but what if he had just spoken English? Why the weird reindeer language? Tim Allen had to repeat everything Comet said just so we could understand, and that got a little old. What's that Comet? You can't fly? You say Timmy is at the bottom of the well and he is hemmoraging? Hee hee...sorry, I couldn't resist. Anyway, this review is getting kind of long, so I'll wrap it up by saying that The Santa Clause 2 is a great movie to take the family to, but don't expect long-lasting memories. It certainly looks better than Adam Sandler's animated PG-13 movie. What was that man thinking? I give SC2 3/4 stars."
The Polar Express,2004,6.6,"On Christmas Eve, a young boy embarks on a magical adventure to the North Pole on the Polar Express, while learning about friendship, bravery, and the spirit of Christmas.","A simple story . . . beautifully told . . . magnificently visualized.The IMAX experience was stunning.I did not expect to enjoy the story as much as I did. Simple but quite heartwarming.Although it started a bit slow, it continued to gain momentum (no train analogy intended) through its conclusion. I was not a great lover of the animation of the human characters, but the other animation, whether it be the train, the scenery, the reindeer, or the elves (are elves human?) was quite well done.Perhaps the best review I can provide is that after I watched the Polar Express, I just felt happier."
Flubber,1997,5.3,"An absent-minded professor discovers ""flubber,"" a rubber-like super-bouncy substance.","""Flubber"" is based upon that old comedy clich√©, the absent-minded scientific genius. The central character, Professor Philip Brainard, is a brilliant inventor who has not only invented a robot that will do the housework for him but has also cracked the artificial intelligence problem by producing Weebo, a computer with its own personality that can not only talk to him but also fly. At present he is working on ""flubber"", a rubbery substance that will allow cars and other objects to fly through the air. For all his intellectual brilliance, however, his private life is so disorganised that he has forgotten to turn up to his own wedding to his attractive sweetheart Sara, not once but three times.The plot turns upon Brainard's attempts to produce his flubber, which he sees as a solution to the financial problems confronting the college at which he teaches and of which Sara is the principal. (Like another reviewer, I found myself wondering why he didn't just try marketing his domestic robot or his talking computer, inventions which I thought would have had just as much commercial potential). Along the way, he has to fight off Wilson, the handsome but too smooth principal of another college who is his rival for Sara's affections, and a corrupt businessman who wants to use the flubber for his own selfish ends.The film was clearly designed as a comedy for children, and works quite well as such, aided by a good deal of slapstick humour, mostly involving Robin Williams as Brainard. Unlike some children's films, however, such as the ""Harry Potter"" series, this one does not have much in it to keep adults entertained. Williams is clearly a talented comedian, but strangely enough, with a few exceptions such as ""Mrs Doubtfire"", he has been most successful in films with a serious purpose like ""Dead Poets Society"" or ""Good Morning Vietnam"", although even in these he often manages to find a use for his comic talents. In many of his comedies his talents just seem wasted. ""Club Paradise"" is an example, and ""Flubber"" is another. All the other characters, with one exception, just seem like stock figures with little individuality about them.The one exception is Weebo the computer. The British computer pioneer Alan Turing devised what has since become known as the ""Turing Test"" for deciding whether a machine can be said to be intelligent. A human judge engages in a conversation with two other parties, one a human and the other a machine; if the judge cannot tell which is which, the machine is said to pass the test. Unfortunately, if the human involved were one of those in this film, Weebo would fail the test. She (Weebo has a female voice and personality) is smart, funny, sensitive and lovable, much more so than anyone else in the film, so it would be easy to tell them apart. And when your most interesting character is an electronic rather than a flesh-and-blood one, your film has got problems. 5/10"
Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause,2006,4.9,"Santa, a.k.a. Scott Calvin, is faced with double-duty: how to keep his new family happy and how to stop Jack Frost from taking over Christmas.","Okay, I will start off with the cons first. The story is very predictable and uneven, and there is an anti-climatic ending that really does detract from the fun the film does have. The film also suffers from the direction needing a much harder edge. However, my biggest con was that the messages about commercialising Christmas being evil felt misplaced. Despite its flaws, it is a mildly enjoyable family film, even if it did mean it is my least favourite of the three movies. The film visually is quite possibly the most colourful of the three, the special effects with the exception of the reindeer who look as though they have been stuffed were above average, and the cinematography is nice. There are some good laughs mostly from Jack Frost and the Experimental Elf, and the acting was amiable. While generously underplaying, Tim Allen once again does a good job as Santa, and Ann-Margaret and Alan Arkin in particular do well as his in-laws. But it is Martin Short who steals the film, in a wonderfully wacky portrayal of the villain Jack Frost, and I have to say the makeup on it was superbly done. And the soundtrack is cool, and the songs featured are sung with unusual gusto. Plus, the cameos from Mother Nature, Sandman and Father Time(the late Peter Boyle) are inspired. The film, and I am not sure whether this is good or bad, also is very suagry sweet. All in all, not bad, but my least favourite of the Santa Clause movies. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids",1989,6.4,The scientist father of a teenage girl and boy accidentally shrinks his and two other neighborhood teens to the size of insects. Now the teens must fight diminutive dangers as the father searches for them.,"Or as my mom would say ""cute"". This is by far one of the finest family films I have ever seen. I consider ""Toy Story"" and ""Babe: Pig In The City"" as its only rivals for my favorite family film. Anyway, it's by far a very enjoyable movie, with nice special effects (the giant insects) and a real play-fun spirit like the part where they eat a giant oreo cookie or slept in the lego block. The kids are indeed very likeable, and the movie even has a sense of adventure. I'll never forget the giant (well, giant to them anyway) water drops that were terrorizing them and Amy slowly falling into a pool of mud and grime(and the grimy pool with the dead ant floating in it they found earlier). I'll always remember the funny way the dad said ""Russel!"" and the overviewed music they had at the beginning where they first saw the large outside or Wayne's shouting of ""Get off the grass!!"". I really can think of very few things I didn't like about this film. I now wonder exactly how many times they had a shrinking story (from an episode of a show or a video game etc.) that had the words ""Honey, I Shrunk The ....."". I recommend it to your kids. They won't be disappointed. A 10/10. Nice sequel too.Could it possibly be that in the movie ""Dinosaur"" when he was dodging the fireballs that was a reference to this movie with how they were dodging the water drops?"
Hook,1991,6.8,"When Captain James Hook kidnaps his children, an adult Peter Pan must return to Neverland and reclaim his youthful spirit in order to challenge his old enemy.",This was a gooood film and Spielberg was a genius. I don't understand why a lot of people hated it. It dealt with the loss of childhood innocence and the dread of adulthood by embodying these themes in the character of an adult Peter Pan.
Stardust,2007,7.6,"In a countryside town bordering on a magical land, a young man makes a promise to his beloved that he'll retrieve a fallen star by venturing into the magical realm.","Surprised at how much I enjoyed this. The characters were really well developed, the world building was fantastic and the action was really enjoyable. Mark Strong is great as ever as the villain, but it has to be Robert DeNiro who just steals the film in the weirdest role I could think of for him. The story is genuinely intriguing, but it's the world building that really did it for me. I really felt immersed in this fantasy world, and the exposition was delivered really naturally. As much as I have gripes with some of Matthew Vaughn's films, the actual direction is never the issue, and it's quite good here too. Now my main issue is that the film is trying to juggle quite a lot of storylines, and it feels a bit rushed as a result. You could probably cut Michelle Pfieffer's plotline down quite a bit in order to concentrate on the main storyline more. But overall, this is a surprisingly fun film that I would definitely recommend"
The Karate Kid,1984,7.3,"Recently relocated from NJ to LA, Daniel becomes the target of a gang of Cobra Kai dojo students. When Mr. Miyagi saves him with expert Karate skills, Daniel convinces him to teach him to defend himself, and put his bullies in their place.","Reviewers say 'The Karate Kid' is celebrated for its heartwarming mentorship story and nostalgic 80s vibe. The Daniel and Mr. Miyagi relationship, along with iconic moments like ""Wax On, Wax Off"", are highly praised. The film's message about balance, perseverance, and inner strength resonates deeply. Martial arts scenes, especially the tournament, are exciting and well-choreographed. However, some find the film predictable and formulaic, with pacing and character development issues. Despite these flaws, it remains a beloved classic."
Hours,2013,6.3,A father struggles to keep his infant daughter alive in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.,"In August 2005, in New Orleans, Nolan Hayes (Paul Walker) brings his pregnant wife Abigail (Genesis Rodriguez) with Eclampsia to the Saint Mary Hospital. Abigail delivers a premature baby and dies and the baby needs to be kept in a ventilator. A few hours later, the Hurricane Katrina hits the hospital, cutting the power and the hospital is evacuated. Nolan stays with his daughter since the equipment is not portable and soon he finds that the battery is in the end of its life and only can hold three minutes of charge. He finds a battery charge and has initially to crank every three minutes. As long as time goes by, the battery holds less charge. But the situation gets worse when marauders invade the hospital.""Hours"" is a dramatic and tense movie with Paul Walker that has magnificent performance in the role of a father that struggles to keep his baby alive during the tragedy of the Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. The screenplay is filled with his recollections of his beloved wife that breaks the tension. Despite the story is almost theatrical in one location, it never disappoints. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Contagem Regressiva"" (""Countdown"")"
The Butler,2013,7.2,"As Cecil Gaines serves eight presidents during his tenure as a butler at the White House, the civil rights movement, Vietnam, and other major events affect this man's life, family, and American society.","The Butler (Daniels, 2013, B+)This should have been a punchline. At least, that's what I was walking in expecting. From the overblown marketing to the downright bizarre cast, it had all the trimmings of a pure turkey. Here's the thing, though... It's not. The film is not a facsimile of historical events, it is an invigoration of them and despite the relatively classical style on display, Lee Daniels brings a real brio to the proceedings. It helps that he has Whitaker to make it all stick as the film's unfailingly warm and engaging center. Even in the first 20-30 minutes when the film is struggling to find its legs, his performance is an unmannered beauty. The rest of the actors are also galvanized into action, proving that verisimilitude is not the highest criteria for historical fiction. This is a film as powerful, as beautiful, as unlikely, and as raggedly imperfect as the country it chronicles."
"Honey, I Blew Up the Kid",1992,4.9,"The Szalinski family is back, this time hilarious disaster strikes when an experiment causes their new toddler son to grow many stories tall.","I don't mind sequels, some are great like Home Alone 2 and Empire Strikes Back, some are nothing special but can be an improvement over their originals like Garfield 2 and others that belong in the garbage like Home Alone 4 and NeverEnding Story 3. This sequel really isn't that bad, at this point I don't think it belongs in either of these categories but in a category titled ""a sequel that isn't as good as the original, but a sequel worth watching"". It is very daft, even more dafter than Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, with a very silly final 20 minutes and the pacing at this point in the film isn't as strong as it was in the first 40 minutes, which was fun, fun, fun personified. Still, it is very entertaining for a number of reasons. It is nicely filmed, with a good soundtrack and some fun gags and physical comedy. But it was the performances that made it worthwhile. Rick Moranis reprises his role as Wayne and is immensely likable as always, and Marcia Strassman is great as Diane. Daniel and Joshua Shalikar are very cute as Adam, who has a nice, funny little laugh that doesn't grate, thank goodness. The other kids give appealing performances once again, the teen romance is evident here and is rather sappy, but hey I can live with that. Overall, for a sequel, this is really not bad. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
Ever After,1998,7.1,"The Brothers Grimm arrive at the home of a wealthy Grande Dame who speaks of the many legends surrounding the fable of the cinder girl before telling the ""true"" story of her ancestor.","A modern spin on the fairy tale ""Cinderella"". When I first went to see this movie in the theatre, I was very skeptical as I'm not a Drew Barrymore fan but she absolutely shines as Danielle and has great chemistry with Dougray Scott as the handsome and funny Prince Henry. I love the scenery and costumes, and all the characters are wickedly funny. The story is very endearing and absorbing as well. Don't miss this movie!"
There's Something About Mary,1998,7.1,"A man gets a chance to meet up with his dream girl from high school, even though his date with her back then was a complete disaster.","There's definitely something about this film. When I saw this film, I was thinking of The Wedding Singer because both movies were set relatively the same time and both lead actresses happened to be blonde.I thought Ben Stiller played an excellent character in Ted as he tried locate the girl he had a crush on in high school. Cameron Diaz was superb in her role as Mary and the actor who played her brother was an excellent addition to the movie because he played his part as a disabled man really well. I'm not a real huge Matt Dillon fan and his role in this movie didn't do much to change my mind. He was very despicable as the sleazy private investigator who has the task of tracking the high school crush down; however, what he doesn't tell Ted when he does find her makes this film more interesting.Who would think that this film has twists that would blow the audience away; it does and not just one, it has two. These twists are really something of a shock, especially to me who was not expecting it to occur the way it did.Overall, this film was enjoyable I wouldn't mind seeing it a second time."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,1997,6.6,"A research team is sent to the Jurassic Park Site B island to study the dinosaurs there, while an InGen team approaches with another agenda.","Reviewers say 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is lauded for its thrilling action, impressive effects, and Jeff Goldblum's return. The darker tone and dinosaur behavior exploration are appreciated. However, critics cite weak characters, a convoluted plot, and repetitive elements from the original. Inconsistencies and unrealistic scenarios, especially in the final act, are noted. Despite flaws, it is seen as an entertaining sequel offering fun and excitement."
Jurassic Park III,2001,6.0,"A decidedly odd couple with ulterior motives convince Dr. Grant to go to Isla Sorna for a holiday, but their unexpected landing startles the island's new inhabitants.","Reviewers say 'Jurassic Park III' offers thrilling dinosaur action and a welcome return of Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant, though it lacks a compelling plot and deep character development. The absence of Steven Spielberg is noted, with some missing the original's magic. Special effects receive mixed reviews, and the film's pacing is debated. Overall, it's an enjoyable yet flawed installment."
Corpse Bride,2005,7.4,"When a shy groom practices his wedding vows in the inadvertent presence of a deceased young woman, she rises from the grave assuming he has married her.","People say that Corpse Bride was horribly boring, etc. HOWEVER, that is because they are comparing this nonstop motion picture with Nightmare Before Christmas. Those who were really upset after the movie, saying that 'it's definitely not Nightmare', you are absolutely right. It is not Nightmare. It's Corpse Bride, a completely different movie. Everything was comparison, Nightmare to Corpse Bride, and yes, I'll admit, I enjoyed Nightmare more. However, when going to see this movie, you cannot compare Corpse Bride to Nightmare because then yes, you will be upset. If they had done another Nightmare, they would have done it years ago. But this is a different movie with a beautiful plot when you think more closely about it. It's a very strong plot of love, betrayal, hate, death, etc and you see that very strongly if you listen closely to Danny Elfman's wonderful music, vocal and instrumental. Basically, go into the theaters with an open mind and enjoy and pay attention to the movie because it truly has strong, very strong, meanings. If truly watching and comprehending, at parts you cry and at others you smile. It's very clear that it is beautifully created and the actors match their parts well, but the storyline is simply beautiful. Do not think about Nightmare because that movie has been finished years ago, but enjoy Corpse Bride. I will not give anything away, so I leave my review at that. Enjoy Corpse Bride people! And for others who think I am Anti-Nightmare or something, I am seriously not. I loved and still love that movie, but just enjoy Corpse Bride without judgement until after the movie."
Never Been Kissed,1999,6.0,A newspaper reporter enrolls in high school as part of research for a story.,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, because the previews made it look hysterical.  I was surprised that this is one of the first movies that I have ever seen that doesn't give away the ENTIRE plot in the trailer.I was glad that I got to see the movie, but I came away feeling that the movie was really inconsistent.  It is not up to the standards of some of the other teenage-girl angst flicks (She's all That and 10 things I hate about you come to mind).  The heroines in those movies could wipe the floor with any of the characters in Never Been Kissed."
My Name Is Earl,,7.8,"A ne'er do well wins $100,000 in the lottery and decides to right all the wrongs from his past with his newfound realization!","I rarely watch sitcoms any more because they are normally both inane and indistinguishable from one another. This show may actually induce me to watch it on a regular basis. If you liked ""Raising Arizona"", you just might like ""My Name Is Earl"". After I watched the first episode I did an online search to find out who the creative forces were behind it. In doing so I stumbled into a review that described Earl as the illegitimate son of Nicholas Cage in ""Raising Arizona"". That just about nails the character. In In fact, while recounting the season opener to a friend who had missed it, I nearly called Earl, Hi. Catch it before it's gone. If you didn't think the first episode was brilliant, then this show is just not for you."
Edward Scissorhands,1990,7.8,The solitary life of an artificial man - who was incompletely constructed and has scissors for hands - is upended when he is taken in by a suburban family.,"This is one of Tim Burton's most powerful movies. Though the title-character seems strange he represents the goodness in the world and what can happen when society just doesn't accept difference. The Gothic look of the castle, combined with the glorious colour of suburbia creates a strong contrast and shows things may not be as they seem. Edward comes from the dark and scary castle but is gentle, kind and loving, the place he wants to be accepted into is the colourful suburbia, which is backstabbing, vicious and evil. This story shows the betrayal of a person who desperately wants to help and to love but does not realise he is being used. The only people that seem to understand him are the wonderful Peg Boggs (played brilliantly by Dianne Wiest) and the beautiful Kim (played superbly by Winona Ryder). Tim Burton has created yet another beautiful fairy tale to captivate adults and children alike. Johnny Depp shows his great talent as an actor and Danny Elfman's music for the movie is some of the most beautiful you're ever likely to hear. A great movie for Christmas and all year round, and while it is a classic story it also deals with the prejudices of society, friendship, family and love and I advise anyone who hasn't seen it to see it, it is an experience well worth it and a movie you'll never forget."
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,2007,7.3,"The legendary tale of a barber who returns from wrongful imprisonment to 1840s London, bent on revenge for the rape and death of his wife, and resumes his trade while forming a sinister partnership with his fellow tenant, Mrs. Lovett.","As a fan of the original stage version of this grimly Gothic tale, going into Sweeney Todd was bittersweet in my hopes and expectations. However, I'm pleased to announce that I did find Burton's latest effort impressive and intentional. Fans of the original won't be disappointed with a top-notch cast and the wonderfully dark overtures that haunt every minute of Sweeney Todd. Tim Burton, one of the masters of ambiance, sets his atmosphere in the grisly streets of a depressed London and his artistry punctures through every scene of screen time. I would have to clarify that, while Johnny Depp is a skilled actor, fans of the original will find it hard to believe that Depp has the ability to transform into the George Hearn ""Sweeny"" we've come to know. This is in fact true and recognized by Burton. In this respect, the character of Depp is not played as the same manner as the deep-voiced, towering Todd from the musical adaptation. Depp's is more of a less boisterous and thoughtful one. The vocal performances are great but have a different approach and feel to them. It was a refreshing adaptation and I feel a triumph on the part of Burton for making a stage-to-screen experience that captures you from it's bloody introduction."
Dark Shadows,2012,6.2,"An imprisoned vampire, Barnabas Collins, is set free and returns to his ancestral home, where his dysfunctional descendants are in need of his protection.","Few director-star collaborations have been as fruitful as that of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, or for that matter quite so deliciously eccentric, and their eighth time together proves no different.Never mind if you haven't any inkling of the cult '70s daytime soap opera on which this is based- a swiftly told prologue recalls the setup by telling of the Collins' voyage to America, their instrumental role in the founding of the Maine seaside town called Collinsport by starting up a successful fishery business, and most importantly, of their heir Barnabas' unfortunate run-in with a jealous witch Angelique (Eva Green). Spurned by Barnabas for another named Josette (Bella Heathcote), Angelique hypnotises her to throw herself off a cliff while turning Barnabas into a vampire and imprisoning him in a coffin.It will be nearly two centuries later by the time some construction workers inadvertently free him, awakening Barnabas to an unfamiliar era where he promptly mistakes the golden arches of a McDonald's for Mephistopheles. That's not the end of the fish-out-of-water jokes that passes as humour- other than the anachronistic values about women and childbirth that Barnabas still clings to, he is just as out of step in front of a TV playing a Karen Carpenter show or among a bunch of hippies.Fans of the original series may object to the deliberately campy tone that Burton and his screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith (with an extra story credit to Burton's frequent writing partner John August) adopt for the movie, but those less bound by expectations will lap up Johnny Depp's delightfully quirky rendition of Barnabas. As always, Depp is a master at facial reactions, with every twitch and raised eyebrow perfectly calibrated to elicit maximum hilarity. Depp and Burton are fully aware of the campiness, but both embrace it so wholeheartedly that you can't quite help but be won by their fidelity.There is also much more than just Barnabas' anachronism of course, with Smith giving the film its due weight in Barnabas' mission of restoring the former Collinwood empire to its former glory. Since locking Barnabas away, Angelique has spent her time building up her own booming fishing business. In the meantime, the Collins have been content to let their lives fall into decay like their sprawling mansion- among the dysfunctional members the matriarch Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer), her dissolute brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller), her impudent teenage daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz) and Roger's disturbed young son David (Gully McGrath).However kooky they may be, Barnabas regards them one and all as family- and as Depp's opening voice-over emphasises, blood is indeed thicker than water. Burton-Depp's collaborations have always demonstrated a tremendous amount of heart for peculiar characters, and this latest reaffirms their love for characters of different quirks and idiosyncrasies.Restoring the empire to its former lustre earns the ire of none other than Angelique itself, the ensuing love-hate relationship between the pair giving the film a mildly sexual edge as well as a thrilling climax which culminates in a visually sumptuous showdown. Admittedly the pace does amble on with little narrative tension for most of the movie, but Burton eventually satiates the thirst for bombast in summer audiences with an extended ending made with most of the film's inflated budget unheard of in the days of the TV series' miniscule own.To be fair, some of that has obviously gone into the ornate sets by production designer Rick Heinrichs as well as the elaborate costumes designed by Colleen Atwood. As is Burton's signature, the imagery stands out as much as the characters do, and the finale is a perfect example of the visual richness of Burton's warped imagination brought to life with CGI. But Burton is not foolish enough to rely simply on these modern-day devices, relying too on good-old fashioned casting to ensure that his film is also a rapturous delight.Any actor besides Depp would probably be upstaged by the fine female cast, each of whom shine not simply because of Atwood's colourful costumes. The standout would probably be Green, who plays Angelique with bewitching aplomb, projecting sass and menace with razor-sharp precision and setting off dangerous sparks with Depp as ex-lovers. With Green's showy performance, it's easy to ignore Pfeiffer's more understated but no less loopy own, the actress who once played Catwoman in Burton's 'Batman Returns' clearly relishing one of her best roles in recent years. Bonham Carter unfortunately gets sidelined in this film, her act as a neurotic shrink underwritten and quite out-of-place amidst the other unfolding plot lines.Amidst the new faces, Burton also pays homage to the original actors of the TV series by inviting four of them- Jonathan Frid, Lara Parker, Kathryn Leigh Scott and David Selby- to appear briefly in the film, as well as the era's definitive musician Alice Cooper for an extended cameo. Despite his irreverent take on the material, Burton is clearly in love with the artefacts of the '70s, and the film's awesome soundtrack with the likes of Moody Blues and the Carpenters is testament to that.So yes, fans of the TV series will have to accept that this big-screen adaptation is a reimagining of the original. Yet for those without that historical baggage, it is with any of the Burton-Depp collaborations that have come before it a thoroughly enjoyable visual feast filled with offbeat characters that turn out ghoulishly endearing. This is clearly a passion project for both Depp and Burton, and 'Dark Shadows' as its deliberately idiosyncratic title suggests is an unusual summer season offering that packs its own unique brand of kooky appeal."
Mars Attacks!,1996,6.4,Earth is invaded by Martians with unbeatable weapons and a cruel sense of humor.,"This film takes the p*ss out of pretty much everything, is very whacky, absurd and - depending on your sense of humour - extremely funny. Don't watch if you take yourself or humankind too seriously. Quite unique, with wonderful B-movie vibe and stellar cast. Anarchic and biting wit throughout. Watch out for the nuke blow-back scene which is one of the funniest things I've ever seen on screen. Improves with repeated viewings. Recommended."
From Hell,2001,6.7,"In 1888 London, a Scotland Yard investigator searches for Jack The Ripper.","The best thing about an enduring mystery is that people can feel free to take all sorts of liberties with the facts and create interesting ""what if"" scenarios.  FROM HELL is a perfect example.  For the record, the theory behind the killings is pretty much right out of JACK THE RIPPER: THE FINAL SOLUTION by Stephen Knight, and it's been pretty well discredited since it first came out twenty years ago, even though it makes a hell of an entertaining piece of fiction.I completely discount any criticisms of the movie where people say ""it didn't happen that way"".  Of course it didn't; that's why this is a fictional film and not a documentary.  It's very loosely based on the Alan Moore graphic novel, and about all it retains of it is the Duke of Clarence theory and the stylish look of the architecture.  It's enough to make the film beautiful to watch.Yes, I know that four of the five victims of Jack the Ripper were women in their late 40's, which on the streets of Victorian London would mean that they would resemble crones in their late 60's or early 70's.  Just try to make that fly past a Hollywood studio boss; the casting at least had women who looked fairly human rather than like fallen glamour girls.  I've read a couple of comments disparaging the accents.  Actually, Cockney accents were the norm in the street because people tried to blend in and often weren't eager to advertise Scottish or Irish origins.I call special attention to the performance of Jason Flemyng in the role of Netley, the coachman, arguably the most fascinating and believable character in the whole production.  Most of his best scenes ended up on the cutting room floor, unfortunately, and yet he still manages to pull the movie together into a cohesive whole just by his presence.  (It must have been a heck of a fun role to play!)  As well, Sir Ian Holm deserves special mention for stepping in when the original choice for his role, Sir Nigel Hawthorne, tragically became ill and died just before the film went into production.  I have never seen Sir Ian in any role that I didn't find completely believable, and that ranges all the way from KING LEAR to his role in ALIEN, for heaven's sake.My interest in the whole Jack the Ripper case has been reawakened thanks to this movie, and I'm trying to hunt down a copy of Alan Moore's graphic novel (which is very difficult to find).  No, it's not even close to an approximation of what really happened; nobody will ever know the truth, Patricia Cornwell's arrogant claims notwithstanding.  It's still worth renting, if only for the beautifully ominous score and the fascinating transformation of Prague into Victorian London.  I thoroughly enjoyed it."
Beetlejuice,1988,7.4,"The spirits of a deceased couple are harassed by an unbearable family that has moved into their home, and hire a malicious spirit to drive them out.","This movie always was: 1 - very popular; 2 - very different; 3 - very entertaining; 4 - a very fast-moving hour-and-a-half of a film.Several characters in here - mainly Michael Keaton's unique and sometimes- revolting title character ""Beetlejuice""- are always fascinating to watch. With him - and the whole movie - you also get a lot of humor and scary special-effects..It was odd to see Alec Baldwin in such a low-key role. In the '90s, he played very few of these type of guys. Davis looks and acts like...well, Davis, who has almost always played nice, cute people that viewers like. It took me four viewings before I finally appreciated Catharine O'Hara's comedic talents in this movie. Now, she's my favorite and someone I find absolutely hilarious as the messed-up wife/mother of a family who moves into a ""haunted house"" inhabited by Baldwin and Davis.Keaton made himself a name as an actor with this whacked-out Robin Williams-type role, although he never really followed up with anything that was as popular as this film. Winona Rider is cute as the teenage daughter and we get other fun supporting roles from diverse people as talk show host Dick Cavett, singer Robert Goulet and actor Jeffrey Jones. All of them are good.Tim Burton directed the film and so I wasn't surprised there were the typical occult themes with ghosts and the like, and no heaven or hell but some other strange existence being touted where dead people go....a ridiculous picture of the afterlife. However, I just chalk it up to someone just trying to make a fun, entertaining picture and on that, it succeeds.Overall, a unique and entertaining film. It's different, to say the least!"
Sleepy Hollow,1999,7.3,Ichabod Crane is sent to Sleepy Hollow to investigate the decapitations of three people; the culprit is legendary apparition The Headless Horseman.,"Enjoyable version about known Washington Irving's novel, titled ¬®The legend of Sleepy Hollow¬®. It concerns on Ichabod Crane(excellently personified by Johnny Depp). He's a N.Y. constable assigned to investigate brutal murders in a little town named Sleepy Hollow. Crane is housed by Balthus Van Tassel(Michael Gambon), whose beautiful daughter(Christina Ricci) falls in love for him. At the beginning Crane denies to believe that a rider without head committing the grisly killings, but he's early convinced when seeing the graphic evidence of his own hands. Meanwhile, wealthy authorities and rich proprietaries (Richard Griffiths,Ian McDiarmid,Michael Gough,Michael Gambon) from village reunite to planning and defending against the amazing beheaded creature.Finally, all it leads to an unexpected twist and breakthrough ending on what's happened before.This is an agreeable and effective film, still has shock value from grisly killings .It's proceeded with a Burton style and containing colorful images and wonderful dreams with Burtonized narrative. The movie is plenty on suspense, thriller, grisly terror and sensationalistic set pieces horror when the decapitations take place. Wide use of gore and now famous decapitation , for those who like this kind of things. Casting frankly extraordinary with several famous actors and exceptional secondary cast and special cameos by Martin Landau and Christopher Lee .Glimmer cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki and sensational musical score by Danny Elffman, both are Burton's usual. The film is lavishly produced by Francis Ford Coppola-Zeotrope studios- and Kevin Yagher-famous makeup expert- .The motion picture is marvellously directed with visual style and fair-play by the great Tim Burton. Rating : Magnificent flick and better than average."
Drillbit Taylor,2008,5.7,Three kids hire a low-budget bodyguard to protect them from the playground bully.,"I'm one of those ""indie-films-or-bust"" type of people (with my favorite movies ranging from Amelie to the Darjeeling Limited), so when I saw the preview for Drillbit Taylor, it was an immediate turn-off for me. I saw it as boob, nuts, and ass jokes (aka crude teenage humor) and I was not excited to see it. However, an opportunity arose to see the movie well before it came out and I took the chance to see it.To my great surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie to its fullest. Sure Owen Wilson is funny, but the kids stole the show. The crude humor was left to a minimum and the funniest lines were the really subtle ones that almost everyone missed. This movie had heart and a good message (which you don't normally see in mainstream teenage movies *excluding Juno*). Although I know it's probably not gonna make huge headlines, I feel like this movie needs more recognition than it's gonna get. I want to see this movie go big, and I'm excited to see what people say about it. So take it from me, it's funny and it's not disappointing."
The Constant Gardener,2005,7.3,A widower's transcontinental quest to find answers about his wife's death leads him to explosive secrets.,"I thought the movie was great and worthy of the praise it has been getting from audiences and critics alike. Ralph Fiennes gives the performance of his career as a grieving man looking for answers and is slowing discovering the corruption all around him and Rachel Weisz steals the film whole heartily with a really deserving Oscar worthy performance as a human rights activist who will stop at nothing to get at the truth. The story is pretty scary and the cinematography is fantastic. Yes, the shaky camera can get in the way but it's not distracting enough to ruin the film.If you want to see a movie that will make you think, this is it."
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,2005,7.6,"As the Clone Wars nears its end, Obi-Wan Kenobi pursues a new threat, while Anakin Skywalker is lured by Chancellor Palpatine into a sinister plot for galactic domination.","Reviewers say 'Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith' is lauded for its action, effects, and darker tone. The tragic fall of Anakin Skywalker and the rise of the Empire are highlighted. However, dialogue and Hayden Christensen's performance receive criticism. Pacing and plot points are seen as rushed. Despite these issues, the film's visual storytelling and conclusion of the prequel trilogy are appreciated."
Stepmom,1998,6.8,"A terminally ill woman must deal with her ex-husband's new lover, who will be their children's stepmother.","I loved this movie! If you are in the mood for a tear jerker movie, this is the movie too see. Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon are remarkable together. This is the absolute best I have seen Julia Roberts act and this movie defiantly brings out her talent. Susan Sarandon can make any movie good. But she delivers outstanding effort to make her character relate to other women who have had the problems that Susan's character faces. This movie is of course a 10 out of 10! Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon will make you laugh now and then, but they will also make you cry with the difficulties that they face together on screen. Stepmom is a movie you'll enjoy and ""always always"" remember as a movie that filled your heart. So if you haven't seen Stepmom yet...go and see it! You'll be glad that you did."
Blow,2001,7.5,"The story of how George Jung, along with the Medell√≠n Cartel headed by Pablo Escobar, established the American cocaine market in the 1970s in the United States.","Not a bad movie, above average, but nothing extraordinary, nothing that could even remotely be compared with for example, Scarface.In my opinion the main 'problem' with this motion picture is that Depp is never really believable as a hardened drug dealer, there is no way that the real George Jung was ever even remotely like that. The proof of this is in the last frame of the movie where we see the real George's face staring at us from the screen. At that precise moment we know: the real George Jung was very, very different, his face tells us that.On the other hand, Paul Reubens is excellent as Derek Foreal and the very good soundtrack is also worthy of mention. All in all, a good movie definitely worth watching, but also a movie that could have been much much better."
The Bourne Legacy,2012,6.6,"An expansion of the universe from Robert Ludlum's novels, centered on a new hero whose stakes have been triggered by the events of the previous three films.","As a fan of the Bourne franchise, I enjoyed this deeper look in to that universe. The movie really does feel like one giant glorified DVD extra for that trilogy and I mean that in a good way. Deeper layers are revealed and the intrigue is as good as what we've seen before even though the character motivation isn't as strong across the board. Renner is fabulous as the second generation super spy. My only real complaint about this installment (because it does feel like they are blatantly building for three more films) is that the resolution has no real teeth. Still, it's a very good effort from a very good cast with hints and touches to the Bourne films of the past.Overall, a thumbs up and a very enjoyable time at the cinema."
Heroes,,7.5,Common people discover that they have super powers. Their lives intertwine as a devastating event must be prevented.,"Heroes is one of the most controversial shows of the decade, but not for the reasons you may think. When Heroes premiered, it was one of the most popular shows on television. Fanboys were created around the world, but disaster struck: Heroes, for reasons unknown, started to suck after a wonderful first volume. Fanboys were in denial everywhere: Was their precious Heroes really going down the drain, or was it just a hiccup? People expected old Heroes to come back when volume three came to us, and.... Heroes was awful. People stopped watching, but as they stopped, the old Heroes we loved slowly came back in volume four. Now the show is in volume five, and did the show returned to form? Read on...VOLUME ONE: GENESIS - Here's the thing about Heroes: Instead of having ""seasons"" like normal TV shows, it has ""volumes"" to be more like comic books. Volume One is where everything starts. In it the Heroes must stop a nuclear bomb from exploding in NYC, but all of the Heroes are scattered around the world and none of them except one knows about it. We're introduced to the main cast that has remained with us up until recently. The best part about superhero stories has often been said to be the ""discovery"" phase, and the whole first season is devoted to that. As the volume progressed, the characters become more accustomed to their powers, showing the natural stages of average Joe to superman. The magic of real people having superpowers captivated the world. The only major downside to this volume was the average finale. People expected a grand finish for the volume, but one wasn't delivered. Maybe I wasn't disappointed because I watched this volume after the fact, but fans were just plain angry. Despite the sub par finale, expectations still soared for volume two...VOLUME TWO: GENERATIONS - Volume Two dealt with heroes from the past, and the heroes also had to stop a virus from being released. Sounds exciting... at least on paper. In execution however, this volume was horrible. Nothing happened in the first 4 episodes. It was BORING. These people have superpowers, but they aren't doing anything. Things started to pick up, but none of it seemed to be planned out. As the volume started to be interesting, the volume was cut short due to the writer's strike. What we're left with is a boring mess that made fans want to tare their hair out. Tim Kring apologized for the show's 180 degree turn in quality. Fans laid the blame on the writer's strike, so expectations soared yet again for volume three...VOLUME THREE: VILLAINS - Volume three had the heroes trying to stop a formula which gives normal people superpowers from being mass produced, and would therefore destroy the world. This season started out by introducing new characters to us and created exciting new twists that should have been awesome. After the premier though, things started to suck. Instead of things being too slow now, they were too fast. Random things were happening left and right, the plot was spinning out of control, and fans everywhere gave up on the show. Thankfully, this volume was only half the season, and Heroes then segued into volume four...VOLUME FOUR: FUGITIVES - After the events in volume three, the show rightfully decided to ignore most of volumes two and three. This volume had the heroes on the run from the US government. After the madness of the last two volumes, people had given up on the show. Something happened which I started calling the ""Heroes effect"". The Heroes effect is this logic: The last two volumes of Heroes were so awful that Heroes is bad forever no matter what. This of course is not true. With this volume, the plot slowed down and the heroes started doing rational things. We started to actually care for them again, and they did things logically again. The magic of the show started to return, but by this point there were only about 10 people left who cared enough to notice. The volume also slowly drifted away from most of the show's usual tropes, and fans started to actually look forward to next week's episode. With Heroes starting to get back on track, we now have the current volume...VOLUME FIVE: REDEMPTION - This volume, aptly titled ""Redemption"", shows how the writers have learned from their mistakes. The cast aren't bouncing off the walls like in Volume Three, but they aren't sleeping like in Volume Two. The heroes did things we can relate to again, the new villains this round were the most interesting since the first volume, and most of the stuff they did was logical. It started off a bit slow, but takes off with episode 4. After that most of the episodes were awesome up until episode 12; then the volume became really boring. Almost Volume 2 boring. It kills all of the momentum it built up. It's like this for a while, but then the last 4 episodes are fantastic. This volume, unlike all of the others, actually has a satisfying ending. If it didn't have those really slow episodes in the middle, Volume Five would be just as good as Volume One. It's certainly more entertaining than the previous three volumes.Looking back, it's a miracle how the show got back on track. Heroes promised so much in volume one, but didn't deliver any of it. Heroes had fallen so far that the turn around in quality doesn't even matter now. Most people who watched the show are now biased against it, and the ratings are so low that the show's future is in doubt. Luckily NBC's ratings suck this season, and Heroes is still one of its better performing shows, so Heroes might get lucky.If you plan to watch Heroes for the first time, skip volumes two and three. They'll make your brain hurt."
Practical Magic,1998,6.3,"Two witch sisters, raised by their eccentric aunts in a small town, face closed-minded prejudice and a curse which threatens to prevent them ever finding lasting love.","Finally.....Through this autumn's movie mediocrity, comes a fresh, fun and deliciously wicked movie by acclaimed actor/director Griffin Dunne.  I must first point out that I did not read the book... and also that I am male (drawing attention to this fact since most of my male friends would not be caught DEAD in a male-bashing, chick flick dark comedy that reeks in the celebration of womankind!)Sondra Bullock and Nicole Kidman are devilishly sexy as the spell-casting sisters doomed to be single for the rest of their natural life... and Stockard Channing and Diane Weist are also enchanting as their aunts that have raised them on chocolate cake and midnight margaritas!  Aidan Quinn rounds out the superb cast as a detective determined to find out the truth behind the disappearance of a wanted killer.With a terrific soundtrack and an equally impressive musical score, Practical Magic will surprise and delight many a filmgoer who delves into the fantasy and fun of being bewitched!"
Seven Years in Tibet,1997,7.1,"Heinrich Harrer, an Austrian climber and Nazi supporter, breaks out of a British POW camp in India and treks to the holy city of Lhasa where he's employed as an instructor to the young 14th Dalai Lama and soon becomes his close confidante.","This is a panoramic film exploring the wilderness of Tibet through the consciousness of an arrogant Austrian climber (Brat Pitt). As Pitt challenges Nanga Parbet, the ninth highest mountain in the world and one of the hardest to climb, the political chaos of late 1930's and 1940's, and his own demons, the nature of mankind is revealed as layers of civilization are peeled to reveal an inner self paradoxically more powerful and yet more vulnerable to the ebb and flow of inhumanity. His own philosophical journey is a reflection of political machinations of the time, the ontogeny recapitulating phylogenetic change of western civilization resulting in a complex modern world forever coiled for violence and warfare.This film has a European pace unsuitable for those addicted to action figure movies with huge budgets and high body counts. I recommend it as a ""good view"" similar to a good read."
Harry Potter en de gevangene van Azkaban,2004,7.9,"Harry Potter, Ron and Hermione return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for their third year of study, where they delve into the mystery surrounding an escaped prisoner who poses a dangerous threat to the young wizard.","I thought this was excellent....better than the first two Harry Potter movies combined and better than what has followed.. That's my feeling, and I'm still sticking to it.This was just great fun, right from the opening. In fact, the early bus scene is the best in the film. Overall, the movie didn't have as mean an edge to it as the others, although it has a number of scary moments (which might have warranted a PG-13 rating). That was fine with me. I got tired of the dark, nasty and/or annoying characters of the first two films, and especially the irritating blonde wise-guy kid. I give this major points for cutting his role down. Even Alan Rickman's character softens.In other words, there is no despicable villain to hate throughout the film, which I thought was refreshing. Instead, we just go through one adventure after another until the final surprise ending.Along the way are a lot of fun special effects and scenery, some humor (Emma Thompson is a hoot as an eccentric tea-leaf reader) and some fantastic 5.1 surround sound. I wish all the Harry Potter films were like this one."
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles,1994,7.5,"A vampire tells his epic life story: love, betrayal, loneliness, and hunger.","Interview with the Vampire is such an unusual horror movie, it stands up incredibly well many years later, it's lavish, decadent and sumptuous. The filming and direction are wonderful, it never fails to impress.It's a very different style of horror, it has softer tones, and yet it's blood thirsty when needed. The story telling itself is one of the film's major strengths, it's a captivating watch, splitting vampire lust and cravings against a very human element.Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise are both fantastic, I'd argue it's one of Cruise's best performances, the whole supporting cast are great.I've watched it many times, I've never once lost interest in it. It's a great watch. 8/10"
Quantum of Solace,2008,6.5,James Bond tries to stop an organisation from eliminating a country's most valuable resource.,"This film is about James Bond cracking down a multi-national corporation that works with dictators to get a share of precious natural resources.""Quantum Of Solace"" has an impressive opening sequence. It has high speed car chases with lots of collision and gunshots. The ultra short scenes (all under one second each) and the shaky camera gives urgency and thrill, but it is so hard to actually work out what is happening.There is a lot of action and adrenaline in the film, but the plot seems not to have a focus. Nor does it make sense either, as it feels like an all-action-no-information film. All Bond does is to run around the globe after his target, and viewers are left to wonder how he made it. I don't find myself caring for the plot or the characters. I don't know why this happens, but something is not right with the film and I don't know what."
The A-Team,2010,6.7,"A group of Iraq War veterans look to clear their name with the U.S. Military, who suspect the four men of committing a crime for which they were framed.","Overkill is underrated. One of the many mottoes Colonel John Hannibal Smith throws around whilst hatching his brilliant plans, dispensing them like his insightful wisdom increases the chances of success. A motto director Joe Carnahan has taken to heart in making 'The A-Team'. A smart move, as complete and uncompromising exaggeration appears to be exactly what the format asked for. Especially since the translation of TV shows to the big screen has proved to be no easy task. Just look at 'Miami Vice', which pretty much bombed despite the presence of Michael Mann, the director/producer who created the original series. Or the near criminal trashing √ºberhobbyist MacGuyver recently received by the hands of questionable farce 'MacGruber'. In a world so significantly different from the mid-eighties, the severely underpaid and hopelessly dated missions of the four fugitives could have very much been out of place as well.The reincarnation by the hands of Carnahan however, avoids many of the pitfalls that the outdated format has to offer. For one, the director has brought the well known premise of the series to the present. Vietnam has been replaced by Iraq and the bad attitude of Bosco Baracus is not the only thing that makes the foursome dangerous: the happy-go-lucky stance of a team that rarely asked for enemy casualties has been replaced by an attitude that better suits a group of elite soldiers. What is especially striking is how well the cast handle their roles, and how much fun they have doing so. Understandable, since the characters in Carnahan's installment have been blown up as well. Hannibal in the hands of Liam Neeson, although not as charismatic as George Peppard, is equally complacently on the jazz whenever a dangerous situation can be even remotely relished. Templeton ""Faceman"" Peck in the version of Bradley Cooper enjoys the swindling of both women and all sorts of tools even more than his predecessor Dirk Benedict and the script provides Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson with a philosophical depth to his distinctive character - and evolution thereof - in the BA 2.0 version. The acting skills of the professional wrestler are up for debate, but then again you never questioned Mr. T. either. Even though he played the bejeweled, Mohawk sporting powerhouse with an acute fear of flying as an overly enthusiastic pupil in a school musical, always staring at the next person to speak his lines way long before they had the floor. The biggest fun, however, comes from Howling Mad Murdock in the interpretation of 'District 9'-phenomenon Sharlto Copley, who occupies the crazy pilot with both a zest for life and an absolute fearlessness of death ‚Äì cue the suicidal midair antics. His inimitable flying skills, Murdockian features (sock puppets and his interaction with BA for example) and especially his imitation of Mel Gibson in 'Braveheart' - including stick horse - make him the movies' main asset.The script then. The plot, pretty much a side issue, continuously serves up action excesses ‚Äì equally incredible and entertaining ‚Äì but yields more than a whipped episode of the series stretched to a playing time of two hours. You could say the plot is kind of a cross section of the five years the series ran, if you omit the recurring missions the mercenaries entered into. There is plenty of borrowing from existing story lines, more or less adapted to the new universe of Carnahan. The film opens with a spectacular introduction of the four veterans some years ago - only Hannibal and Face are trusted comrades, BA and Murdock have still to cross their paths - setting up the Alpha team that started it all. Included of course, is a supporting role for the black GMC Van, which can impossibly be disregarded as the fifth member. Cut to eight years and eighty successful missions later, to the operation that sees the team become the proverbial scapegoat the series theme credits were based on ‚Äì something to do with a crime they didn't commit. The bank robbery in Hanoi has been replaced by the hijacking of a truckload of counterfeit money in Baghdad, commanding General Morrison is still here. The CIA is present as well, in a possible set-up for a sequel in which Hannibal's outfit will be contracted by the organization in a reference to Stockwell (Robert Vaughn) of the fifth season of the series. The plot is driven by the aftermath of the robbery, offering supporting roles for Captain Charisa Sosa (the distractingly attractive Jessica Biel) and CIA man Lynch (Patrick Wilson, 'Watchmen'), but it's all a mere hook for ridiculous set pieces and extravagant action to be towed on.Hannibal's crack commando unit must pull out all the stops in order to clear its name, in an adventure that at times offers absolute top entertainment. That is, if you're willing to believe that a parachute suspended tank (as seen in the trailer), wherein the fearless foursome escape from an exploding plane, can be easily maneuvered in midair using the inboard cannon, simultaneously discarding enemy aircraft like it's a game of Duck Hunt. There are enough sequences that ask more than a lot of your ability to shut off your brain, but as said that exaggeration is exactly what this film needed. 'The A-Team' is simply a masterful popcorn spectacle par excellence, offering high-level action entertainment and jokes that are more often than not very decently set up. The cast has great fun working with the pleasantly unlikely adventures and the story is ‚Äì in good tradition - full of references to the 80's hit series it is based on. The plot falters a bit left and right and the credo overkill is underrated is at times perhaps taken a little too far, but that is merely an expected consequence of handing control over to the man behind 'Smokin' Aces'. Regardless, the oncoming release might well feature a well-deserved 'to be continued' by the time the end credits start rolling."
Meet Joe Black,1998,7.2,"Death, who takes the form of a young man killed in an accident, asks a media mogul to act as his guide to teach him about life on Earth and, in the process, he falls in love with the mogul's daughter.","Meet Joe Black is a beautiful film with a talented cast.  Because it is unique, the plot enables humor to be weaved within the dramatic and romantic elements.  The music, composed by Thomas Newman (Shawshank Redemption, Erin Brokovich) truly enhances the movie.  The many string and piano melodies are beautiful, and fit smoothly. There are so many memorable moments, like father-daughter conversations, and the scene in the coffee shop. Brad Pitt, in his portrayal of Death,displays naive and vulnerable feelings, skillfully in sharp contrast his behavior at the beginning of the film.  While some criticize its length and unrealistic aspects of the plot, I found it to be so captivating and quite well-made.  Meet Joe Black has an indescribable effect on me whenever I watch it. The story of Death being apprentice to a respected, accomplished man makes one realize the simple beauties of life-- passion, family, love... and peanut butter."
8 Mile,2002,7.2,"Follows a young rapper in the Detroit area, struggling with every aspect of his life; he wants to make it big but his friends and foes make this odyssey of rap harder than it may seem.","Jimmy 'B-Rabbit' Smith (Eminem) is desperate to be a rapper. It's 1995 Detroit. With the support of his friend David 'Future' Porter (Mekhi Phifer), he aims to overcome his personal problems. His mother Stephanie (Kim Basinger) is a drunk. He leaves his girlfriend Janeane (Taryn Manning) when she tells him that she's pregnant. He chokes on a head-to-head rap battle. He has no place to go but to move back into his mother's trailer. His mom's boyfriend Greg (Michael Shannon) is a jerk. He has a part-time grimy auto parts job and then he meets Alex (Brittany Murphy).Eminem is basically playing himself and he does a good job. He's surrounded by good actors. The sense of the place is the standout of this movie. The Detroit locations have the proper grittiness. The desperation is palpable. The rap battles are exhilarating. The story is relatively standard with nice touches. This is a matter of the perfect story for the perfect lead. He's not really acting as much as being himself."
The Sentinel,2006,6.1,A fugitive Secret Service agent must clear himself of murdering a colleague.,"""The Sentinel"" is an average-at-best action drama that does not come remotely close to reaching its potential. The entire movie feels rushed, with random details about each character's past thrown at you in a poorly-written screenplay. The revelation of the true bad guy in conspiracy films normally elicits at least some form of surprise or intrigue; instead, in ""The Sentinel"" the character is far too obvious and the scene reveals a tangential and unexplained back story that should instead be much more central to the plot.The rush to cram details in every fleeting moment ruins this movie. For example, without spoiling the film, the culminating chase of the movie is ruined by a ridiculous proclamation of certain password to get by people; the ridiculousness of the situation takes away from what should be a tense finish.This review is not meant to be overly disparaging; the film received 5/10 because it is a moderately entertaining summer movie and I did not regret going to see it. However, the skeleton plot seemed to be trying too hard and the characters were not well-utilized. Eva Longoria is very attractive though."
Batman,1989,7.5,"The Dark Knight of Gotham City begins his war on crime with his first major enemy being Jack Napier, a criminal who becomes the clownishly homicidal Joker.","The 1989 Batman is the original Dark Knight and Tim Burton's Classic Dark Knight film. This is my number 1 personal favorite Batman of all Batman movies this is my movie and I love this film to death! Jack Nicholson was well-cast as The Joker he was a wonderful in his lead role performance. Michael Keaton was just great as Bruce Wayne/Batman, he acted like the role of Batman was written on his skin. Kim Bassinger did a wonderful performance as her role Vicki Vale. I think Vicky Vale is very underrated character from all other female lead characters in all Batman films. Michael Gough did a wonderful job as the butler Alfred Pennyworth Batman's helper. Seriously Alfred for me will be always Michael Gough not only that he acted much better than Michael Caine did he even showed more heart and caring in the whole Batman franchise than Michael Caine did. The acting in this film is awesome, the character developments and the story plot are TERRIFIC!Michael Keaton caused an uproar when he was casted as Batman as fans boycotted the idea yet in Christmas 1988 when the trailer hit theaters the silence was shut as it was a nice teaser. This movie was the most hyped movie of 1989 as months audiences including fans had waited even with a second trailer that showed up in the spring of 1989 and merchandise was everywhere as it was the year of the Batman, hell even TV stations had reruns of the 60's Batman show to cash-in on the phenomenon. This movie opened on June 21st 1989 and became one of the highest grossing movies of all time and the biggest movie of the year earning acclaim and making Batman cool again just like Frank Miller and Alan Moore did. The Action and fights sequences were great and awesome. At least so much better than they were in Batman Begins (2005). It was my first Batman film I ever saw and this movie just absolutely Kick Ass. The Batwing that appears by the end of this movie is awesome by using to combat the Joker. When the Joker launches a deadly Smilex gas attack through balloons, Batman came in the Batwing and destroyed the balloons, angering Joker. Awesome! Batman then fired off several missiles and two mini guns, killing many henchmen but missing Joker, who in turn shot it down with one bullet from his long barreled revolver. The Joker Thugs are amazing. The main theme score by Danny Elfman was just amazing and really beautiful. I absolutely love this movie. I would never compare all other Nolan batman films with this masterpiece. Except The Dark Knight that it is the best Batman film. I will say it again this movie is AWESOME! The Batsuit designed by Costume designer Bob Ringwood who turned down the chance to work on Licence to Kill in favor of Batman was AWESOME! Ringwood found it difficult designing the Batsuit because ""the image of Batman in the comics is this huge, big six-foot-four hunk with a dimpled chin.Gotham City, a big city where crime has been occurring lately and a mysterious caped crusader named Batman (Michael Keaton) is wiping streets clean of criminals, it leaves the police especially commissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle) baffled. A gangster named Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson) was dropped into a vat of chemicals which leaves him disfigures with paint-like white bleached skin and ruby-red lips plus green hair which makes him clown-like as he now calls himself Joker, he begins to terrorize the city of Gotham and stalk a sexy photographer named Vickie Vale (Kim Bassinger). Bruce Wayne who is Gotham's richest man falls in love with Vickie yet she doesn't know his true secret that he's Batman, but can Bruce deal with romance and battling with Joker at the same time?Batman is a 1989 American superhero film directed by Tim Burton and produced by Jon Peters, based on the DC Comics character of the same name. It is the first installment of Warner Bros.' initial Batman film series. The film stars Jack Nicholson, Michael Keaton in the title role, Kim Basinger, Robert Wuhl, Pat Hingle, Billy Dee Williams, Michael Gough, and Jack Palance.The Dark Knight of Gotham City begins his war on crime with his first major enemy being the clownishly homicidal Joker.This is definitely my favorite classic Action film from the 80's it was always my favorite childhood movie and it will always be. The action scenes are just fantastic and how Batman saves Gotham City from the Joker balloons of a deadly Smilex gas attack was amazing. Burton's Batman is my number 1 favorite film of all times and it will always be and I love it to death! 10/10Michael Keaton will be the only Batman for me!:P."
Music and Lyrics,2007,6.5,"A washed up singer is given a couple days to compose a chart-topping hit for an aspiring teen sensation. Though he's never written a decent lyric in his life, he sparks with an offbeat younger woman with a flair for words.","There are already 222 reviews of this movie, so the chances of anyone ever reading this are slim. However, I'm a sucker for a longshot. (so if you read this review, please give it a thumbs up or a thumbs down...I'm curious to know if anyone will ever read this, buried under more than 200 other reviews)When a friend suggested we rent this movie, my initial reaction was, ""NO!! It's a chick flick. And besides, it's got Hugh Grant in it. Those are two really big strikes against it."" However, and remember my fondness for longshots, the movie also casts Drew Barrymore in the other lead role. I couldn't resist.To my complete surprise, both actors were excellent, and Hugh Grant doesn't have a bad singing voice. To be honest, if he and Drew Barrymore wanted to record an album of pop songs, I think it could do quite well. Her strength is that she is perky and funny, and that compensates for lack of trained vocal talent. Sometimes you DON'T want to hear Barbra Streisand.Here's the quickie plot summary: Hugh Grant was in a popular band of the 1980s, and now he's reduced to playing for embarrassing venues like shopping malls, amusement parks, and High School reunions. When a Britney Spears-type singer wants him to write her new single, his life changes completely, but only due to Drew Barrymore's help.I now judge movies in part by how my European friends would react to them. I have to admit that some American movies are a little corny, but this movie passed the test with flying colors. A friend from Slovakia not only loved the movie, he insisted on watching the trailers and special scenes.... twice! It was a welcome relief to actually be proud of a Hollywood movie.I now have new-found respect for Hugh Grant, and my admiration for Drew Barrymore is higher than ever. She sure has a lot of talent for playing someone with pluck and a little bit of endearing wackiness."

Batman Returns,1992,7.1,"While Batman deals with a deformed man calling himself the Penguin wreaking havoc across Gotham with the help of a cruel businessman, a female employee of the latter becomes the Catwoman with her own vendetta.","Ah, Batman Returns, is it possible to have a sequel to be almost as good as the original? With Batman Returns, it came pretty close! We have terrific actors and a great plot with the dark knight and two new villains, Catwoman and The Penguin. We have Michael Keaton back as Batman and he's still awesome than ever. Michelle Pfieffer, the perfect choice for Catwoman and was perfectly cast into place. As much as I love and is such an incredible actress Annette Benning, she couldn't have been Catwoman, she doesn't really have the look. Danny DeVito, who could have imagined him as The Penguin? He was just great and terrifying!Batman returns with a more loving community of Gotham City, they are celebrating Christmas time with, Max Shrek played by a creepy Christopher Walken. The perfect villain who mistreats his lovely secretary, Selina who happens to hear too much at his office causing him to push her out the window in hopes that she dies and will never reveal the information of knowing the Penguin and the attempt to make him loved in Gotham.

Her classic moment of just meeting Batman and The Penguin ""Meow"" is classic! There are memorable characters, lines, and sets! You'll have a blast! Trust me!9/10"
Batman Forever,1995,5.4,"Batman must battle former district attorney Harvey Dent, who is now Two-Face and Edward Nygma, The Riddler with help from an amorous psychologist and a young circus acrobat who becomes his sidekick, Robin.","Batman Forever may be the most unfairly criticzed super-hero film ever made. It's sandwiched between the fandom of the Burton and Nolan films while simultaneously blamed for leading to Batman and Robin. If you compare it to the darker and more gothic Burton films and are disappointed Keaton isn't still playing Batman, of course you're not gonna enjoy it. If you compare it to the more serious neo-realism of the Nolan films, again you're not gonna enjoy it. What is it you ask? Batman Forever essentially plays out like a live action cartoon and it does this very well. If you watch it through that lens instead of judging it for what it's not you'll find that Batman Forever actually has superior continuity and pacing than any other Batman film except maybe the 1966 version. This is coming from someone who's favorite film is Batman 1989 and a big Tim Burton fan. It honestly baffles me to hear people rave about how great Batman Returns is and then go on to bash Batman Forever. While Returns has a ton going for it, it really suffers from the same core problem as Batman and Robin; the director getting too cute with creative control. All Joel Schumacher did was set out to make a fun super-hero film with something for everyone to enjoy and I honestly think he succeeded with Forever. With Batman and Robin he went too flamboyant just like Burton went too zany and weird with Returns. The first time around both directors got it right testing the waters with their own respective styles. Everything in the film is very cartoonish and if you appreciate it from that perspective it's really quite masterful in a lot of subtle and not so subtle ways. Although Batman The Animated Series was largely influenced by the Burton movies Forever really seems like it's bringing that onto the big screen with real actors and real sets which is quite a feat. Schumacher just added more color and neon which honestly is a welcome change from the stark art deco gothic flavor present in Returns. Nothing wrong with that flavor in Returns, it's just that Burton went all in and we didn't necessarily need more of the same. Batman Returns actually has considerably different art direction from Batman 1989 yet you rarely hear fans complain about that difference or even acknowledge it.Nicole Kidman is perfectly cast as Chase Meridian and I like Chris O'Donnell as Robin even though he was probably a tad old. Everyone criticizes Val Kilmer for being too bland compared to Keaton but honestly the latter wouldn't have worked at all in the film the way it was done. Since Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey are both such strong personalities a more stoic Kilmer contrasts that well. Batman Forever really is Jim Carrey's vehicle though. You watch Batman Forever for Jim Carrey the same way you watch Batman 1989 for Jack Nicholson."
Batman & Robin,1997,3.8,Batman and Robin try to keep their relationship together even as they must stop Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy from freezing Gotham City.,"I saw this movie upon it's release in 1997 I was just six years old and honestly I loved it so much I even had a Batman & Robin movie poster in my room that I got for attending the movies opening day. I got the movie on VHS for my birthday after it was released and I watched it pretty much every weekend at least twice but now that the movie is over twenty years old and I'm an adult with much better taste in movies I thought I'd watch the movie again on Blu Ray and give a review on my nostalgic experience and see if my opinion on the movie has changed much over the years.The first thing I will say about Batman & Robin is that it's the worst Batman movie of them all hands down no amount of nostalgia or good memories of the movie will change that it is simply awful but having said that it's still a fun movie to watch simply because of how over the top and cheesy the movie is from the over the top acting down to the absolutely terrible Batman jokes like the Bat Credit card and the hilarious Mr Freeze one liners told by Arnold Schwarzenegger himself it is impossible not to laugh when watching this movie it's not the serious Batman movie we wanted and it doesn't do the Batman character justice at all.This movie alone was the reason we didn't get a Batman movie for eight years because Batman & Robin failed completely and almost killed the franchise luckily in 2005 we got Batman Begins which introduced the true Dark Knight and would lead to the greatest Batman movie ever made in 2008 Batman The Dark Knight.I love the cast involved Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze is hilarious and Uma Thurman as the sexy, seductive Poison Ivy she really makes a deadly character like Poison Ivy a lot of fun and she really does make the character look sexy as hell.This movie is absolutely hilarious and is a guilty pleasure for me I don't watch it because it's a good movie I watch it simply because it's entertaining and enjoyable it's essentially Batman the parody it's not to be taken seriously it's a bunch of famous actors dressing in spandex so tight we actually get crotch and butt close ups so if you've always wanted to see a Bat suit with actual nipples and a cod peice then your in luck. This isn't the best Batman movie but try and enjoy it for what it is an hour and a half of entertaining fun."
Superman,1978,7.4,"An alien orphan is sent from his dying planet to Earth, where he grows up to become his adoptive home's first and greatest superhero.","Reviewers say 'Superman' (1978) is celebrated for Christopher Reeve's iconic dual role, groundbreaking special effects, and John Williams' epic score. Richard Donner's direction is highly praised. However, criticisms include slow pacing in the first act, lengthy runtime, and campy portrayal of villains like Lex Luthor. The special effects, though innovative, are noted to have aged. Despite these issues, the film is widely regarded as a classic and a major influence on the superhero genre."
Superman II,1980,6.8,"Superman agrees to sacrifice his powers to start a relationship with Lois Lane, unaware that three Kryptonian criminals he inadvertently released are conquering Earth.","Reviewers say 'Superman II' features strong performances, especially from Reeve and Kidder, and an engaging romance. Villains like General Zod add significant threat, but the film suffers from an uneven tone due to director changes. Critics note plot inconsistencies and dated effects, though action sequences and themes of love and responsibility are praised. The debate between cuts further complicates reception."
"Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde",2003,4.8,"Elle Woods heads to Washington, D.C. to join the staff of a Representative in order to pass a bill to ban animal testing.","I went to a free screening and demanded a refund.I was so long ago And it haunts me still. Seriously Don't.I mean it The first was OK.. But this.I mean, it had a sub plot about some dogs.. And there was some pink clothing.I'm sorry. I watched most of it through my fingers.I warn everyone about this movie.I hope you heed mine.Please beware my warning. You cannot Unsee this horror..Turn back while you still can."
Superman III,1983,5.0,"Entrepreneur Ross Webster teams up with a computer genius in order to realise his own evil intentions. When Superman obstructs his plans, he decides to destroy him.","Reviewers say 'Superman III' is criticized for its comedic shift and Richard Pryor's miscast role, which many feel disrupts the series' tone. The absence of Lex Luthor and Lois Lane is noted as a significant drawback. Despite these issues, Christopher Reeve's performance, especially as an evil Superman, is praised. The special effects and action sequences, though less impressive than before, are still commended. Overall, the film is seen as a weaker installment but offers some entertainment and a unique take."
She's All That,1999,6.0,"When Zack's famous girlfriend, Taylor, cheats on him with another boy and parts ways with him, he makes a bet with his friends to turn a socially inept Laney into their high school's next prom queen.","I'd actually recommend seeing it if you don't feel like a heavy movie and just want to watch something fun. The movie is 'another teen movie"" but does have some unique aspects to it, some pretty funny quotes (""what is this, the dork outreach program?"")and moments, but unfortunately, a lot of that average teen movie drama and a few overly two-dimensional characters (Zach's friends and girlfriend). Cool dance scene though, and Freddie Prinze Jr. is bearable Rachel Leigh Cook is likable (I personally thought she was pretty good in it) and notably talented actors like Kevin Pollak, Kieran Culkin, and Anna Paquin give the movie some supporting foundation. Not a bad movie, not a great movie, just simply what it is:'another teen movie'."
Boys and Girls,2000,5.4,A friendship is put to the ultimate test when two best friends wind up in bed together.,"Sometimes you want to watch a film, not to hugely stimulate the mind but to stimulate the heart and this one did it for me. The romantic concept was a familiar one of boy and girl meet but don't seem to get together and they become 'friends' but when they do strife comes of it.  The ending may have been predictable but it was uplifting and very sweet and even though it's just a film you come out feeling optimistic that maybe happy endings do exist."
Down to You,2000,5.0,"College students Al and Imogen meet and fall in love, but fear of commitment causes them to go their separate ways.","What was I thinking? I basically got drawn into seeing this because all my friends wanted to. I figured ""why not"" and while I was watching the ""film"" I found myself asking over and over ""Why me?"" Sure Freddie Prinze Jr. is nice to look at, but worth 7 bucks? I think not.Now, where have I seen this movie before? Oh yes...every other movie directed towards teens in the recent years. I'm sorry, I might just be a teenager but I know crap when it's crap and I know what I like, and this movie I did not. Where was the plot? Where was one spec of originality? And where were the actors?Selma Blair was the best of the bunch. I don't care how good looking Freddie is, he needs to take some acting classes, either that strive to make his characters have a little bit more difference then the name change. I like Julia Stiles, but normally when you have to play off a bad actor it reflects badly on you. I didn't see the chemistry this couple was supposed to have.Yes ""Down to You"" has it's cute moments, some funny moment, and few sweet moment, but worth 7 bucks? Not a snowball's chance in hell. Save your money and your time. Wait for video, or just don't see it at all."
Into the Woods,2014,5.9,A witch tasks a childless baker and his wife with procuring magical items from classic fairy tales to reverse the curse put on their family tree.,"A wonderful cast indeed, and a number of popular fairy tales entwined, but I couldn't help feeling that I was watching a stage play instead of a movie. At times it felt the film was moving in circles, with a sense of deja vu more often than not. I also found the singing just a tad too much, and too drawn out at times. All in all it was a good production, I suppose, but this is an acquired taste, and it just did not tickle my palate. It became too repetitive and boring."
The Prince and Me,2004,5.9,"At college Paige meets Eddie, a student from Denmark, whom she first dislikes but later accepts, likes, and loves; he proves to be Crown Prince Edvard. Paige follows him to Copenhagen, and he follows her back to school with a plan.","This film is a rather light and enjoyable trifle and it does have a very fine performance from Julia Stiles, some very pretty scenery (Prague standing in for Copenhagen), and Miranda Richardson (as the Prince's mom).There is a certain irony to the whole film given that the real Crown Prince of Denmark, HKH Kronprins Frederik, married a commoner from a far flung place...in fact my home country Australia in 2004. (Which has resulted in every Australian becoming an expert on Danish royalty!)But back to the film ...the girl meets boy, girl hates boy, boy falls for girl, girl falls for boy, is as old a story as there is but the film does manage to tell its story with some refreshing touches. Paige's girlfriends are a great collection and the the Prince's valet is very funny.By no means a great film but enjoyable way to waste two hours.But just don't expect to learn anything about modern monarchy in Denmark!!!"
Monsters vs Aliens,2009,6.4,A woman transformed into a giant after she is struck by a meteorite on her wedding day becomes part of a team of monsters sent in by the U.S. government to defeat an alien mastermind trying to take over Earth.,"I honestly don't know what some of these people who've reviewed this film were expecting.Sure, it's called ""Monsters Vs. Aliens."" No, that DOES NOT mean that it HAS to be about five thousand monsters fighting five thousand aliens. You people watch too much Predator vs. Aliens.What this was was a story about one girl, what happens to her and the challenges she faces.And it's funny. Very funny, in an adult, dry and quirky way. It's not trying to be generic, which seems to be what some reviewers want. It's not trying to be a spectacle, like other reviewers expected it to be.It's a well told comedy about this girl Susan.My three year old has seen this movie somewhere in the range of 40 times. I've had to sit through it at least half of that and, quite honestly, it doesn't grow old for me like A Bug's Life or something in that vein might.Too many people with too specific expectations - and no concept of what's good. Must be why Transformers made so much money."
The Raven,2012,6.4,"When a madman begins committing horrific murders inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's works, a young Baltimore detective joins forces with Poe to stop him from making his stories a reality.","On October 3, 1849 Edgar Allan Poe was found wandering the streets of Baltimore, delirious, calling out the name Reynolds. There have been lots of theories as to what Poe died of, from tuberculosis, rabies or to a drunken bender. ""The Raven"" puts forth a more romantic theory and a detective story for the man who invented the modern detective novel.""The Raven"" as a movie demonstrates that you can make a movie that bridges the biographical facts of Poe's life and its own artistic vision and still make an interesting movie. The movie is driven by the premise, a serial killer starts a series of killings in Baltimore that emulate some of the more gruesome murders in Poe's stories. When the first murder is done inside a locked room, police detective Fields (Luke Evans) recognizes it as the setting of an Edgar Allan Poe story. Fields brings in Poe (John Cusack) at first as suspect, but when another murder occurs Poe quickly becomes the first criminal profiler and consultant. Poe helps Fields both in what kind of mind the killer may have and of course in the details from his stories. The killer kidnaps Poe's girlfriend Emily (Alice Eve) with the killer promising clues as to Emily's whereabouts with each new murder he commits.The filmmakers, director James McTeigue and writers Ben Livingstone and Hannah Shakespeare don't try to recast Poe's character as a superhero or give the movie Poe attributes that the real Poe didn't or couldn't possess. As mentioned before, the filmmakers stick fairly accurately to the known elements of Poe's last few days, although there are some artistic liberties taken, and they still present an entertaining movie with a few twists and turns as to who the murderer is.Cusack is spot on as Poe from his look, thin with a black mustache and goatee, to (more importantly) Poe's character. Poe was a writer who had the ultimate confidence in his own abilities as a writer and was dismissive of his contemporaries, especially if they were more successful. Cusack is supported by a cast that hits every note right.If you think a movie about Edgar Allan Poe won't have enough action for you, this is a movie for you. If you're more literary minded and think this movie will have too many inaccuracies or violate Poe's character or will throw in too much action, you won't be disappointed."
Better Living Through Chemistry,2014,6.2,Douglas leads a simple and uneventful existence as a pharmacist in a small town.,"If you never start, you'll never finish. Makes sense, also if you don't break out, you'll stay imprisoned. Both those things do apply to our main hero here (played with much gusto by Sam Rockwell, whose presence alone elevates any and every movie). You also get Olivia Wilde who takes her last name literally ... well her character does.For a ""small"" movie that is quite an impressive cast that assembles here and it does show on screen. There are a few things that might feel a bit clich√©, but that can be attributed to once cynicism or the fact that one has watched too many movies (I'm mainly talking about myself here). But even through all this the movie has heart and does keep you guessing and rooting for the main (naive) guy ... Sam Rockwell can do that to you (the character he's playing)."
The Skulls,2000,5.6,"A senior at an ivy league college, who depends on scholarships and working on the side, gets accepted into the secret society The Skulls. He hopes it betters chances at Harvard but The Skulls is not what he thought and comes at a price.","Joshua Jackson plays a very smart student who is eager to get into law school. Then he is approached by Paul Walker's character who manages to get him to join a secret society only for the smartest of the smartest students known as The Skulls. It seems that everything is going well but then things start to get much more darker.On the face of it, it seems like a brilliant idea for a movie. A good breakaway from the typical teen movie. However, it didn't really make good use of the potential it had to be a great movie. The story was made too thin than it should have been and some other details including character development and about this secret society itself were left rather sketchy.I believe that if these details are elaborated on then this would be a much better and more memorable movie than it actually is."
Something's Gotta Give,2003,6.7,A swinger on the cusp of being a senior citizen with a taste for young women falls in love with an accomplished woman closer to his age.,"I kept thinking, while watching this movie, ""I wish I could write a screenplay as good as this.""  Jack was Impeccable Jack.  Diane was delightful and sexy and a wonderful role model for older women.  Keanu showed more range than people give him credit for, and did an excellent job playing the role he was cast as - a supporting character, who is not supposed to outshine the lead roles, but rather enhance them (which he did). I was very pleased with this movie!  It did have ""several endings"" which, actually, didn't detract but instead made me think, ""Well, that's closer to the reality of what might happen,"" instead of being annoyed.  As Jack's character says, ""Finally, closure,"" and I was happy.  It was a good movie and I liked it quite a lot.  It'll be on my mind and in my thoughts for a while, which is the sign of an impactful movie."
Because I Said So,2007,5.6,A meddling mother tries to set her daughter up with the right man so her kid won't follow in her footsteps.,"At a pre-screening and Q&A with Director Michael Lehmann and writer Karen Leigh Hopkins hosted by critic Leonard Maltin, the soon to be released film opened with mixed reactions before the 365 member audience of USC film students. The narrative gets off to a slow start with on opening sequence that fails to arouse much interest or laughter. Only until a joke is shared between Millie (Moore) and her mother (Keaton) about a man's uncircumcised entity does the audience begin laughing. This is fairly representative of the movie's humor. It is consistently funny, but only through cheap and superficial jokes and scenarios. At times it even verges on slapstick. However, credit must be given to both Moore and Keaton who put out stellar performances. Moore proves her ability to be an actress following initial debut in Saved and will hopefully be able to move past her image as teenie-bopper musician. Keaton convincingly portrays an over the top single mother who cannot keep her nose out of her daughters' business. The film will have wide appeal for female audiences as it is about the mother-daughter relationship. But men will also find humor throughout and should not be discouraged to accompany their wives and girlfriends. (Note: Guys, this is a good chance to compromise on seeing a romantic comedy that will not bore or disgust.) The film sticks to genre conventions but the comedy aspect of the film veers from typical. The set design and editing are both noteworthy. The film will provide a fun evening for couples, old and young, at the theater and home."
Sex Tape,2014,5.1,"A married couple wake up to discover that the sex tape they made the evening before has gone missing, leading to a frantic search for its whereabouts.","Okay, in case you haven't already heard, 'Sex Tape' has been pretty much slated everywhere. Currently it's up for goodness knows how many 'Razzie' awards for how bad it is. And, if you check out the online reviews, you'll see that most people pretty much agreed with its nominations.So, I sat down to watch it, confident in the knowledge that I'd probably be turning it off at about the half hour mark. I actually sat through it all the way.Yes, it's not that good. If you're looking for a laugh-a-minute comedy then you won't find it here. Also, if you're looking for some sort of touching, heart-felt comedy, you won't find that here, either. However, if you're generally okay with comedy which is totally based around sex and don't have your expectations too high, then it's not as bad as some people are making it out to be.I read that much of the hate towards this film centres around the on-screen chemistry between Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel. I can see where this is coming from. Most of the time the pair of them play off each other pretty well, but there were certainly a few scenes where their relationship felt very awkward, forced and even scripted. Diaz handles it better than Segel and she's definitely doing her best to keep the film going.Before you watch this film, stop for a moment to ponder its title. Sex Tape. Does that really conjure up images of high-brow drama and sophistication? Hopefully not. It's pretty much telling you what to expect on the label. I think the trick to getting something out of this is to suitably lower your expectations and accept it for what it is ‚Äì a pretty run-of-the-mill comedy which has its moments, but, ultimately, you probably won't remember for too long. Don't hate it based on what you've heard, just make sure you're in the mood for what it is before you contemplate sitting down for an hour and a half to watch it."
Morning Glory,2010,6.5,An upstart television producer accepts the challenge of reviving a struggling morning show program with warring co-hosts.,"Rachel McAdams is what makes this movie so likable and cute. Her spunky optimism and always-on attitude is what drives the movie forward and gives it heart.This is one of Harrison Ford's funniest roles - he plays the grumpy, I'm too good for this, I will do what I want and you'll just have to deal with it, asshole extremely well.The witty banter back and forth between Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford is at times laugh out loud hilarious. I loved their chemistry and the weatherman's antics were the beginning of when my ratings for the movie started to go up. Once it all got going I thought to myself, ""I'd watch that morning show!"""
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,2012,5.9,"Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, discovers vampires are planning to take over the United States. He makes it his mission to eliminate them.","If you take this movie so serious you'll be disappointed 'cause it's not. But if you take it as fun movie, fulled of action/fantasy/horror scenes and as what it is then you can give it a chance. Maybe, the character of Abraham Lincoln defined as vampire slayer is naive and childish and is not what you expected to see for historical important figure. Maybe someone thinks that this is disgrace for the character. And finally maybe someone thinks there is a storyline abstraction 'cause the book is better and I don't doubt that even I haven't read it. All this defects are not so important if you like movies in this kind of genre like Underworld, Resident Evil etc. This was a movie that deserves attention and give it a try."
The Informant!,2009,6.5,"The U.S. government decides to go after an agro-business giant with a price-fixing accusation, based on the evidence submitted by their star witness, vice president-turned-informant Mark Whitacre.","Layers, more layers, it goes on and on when corporate informer Mark Whitacre (Matt Damon) starts blabbing to the FBI about dodgy shenanigans at his mid-west corn-producing employers.
Who do we believe? Where are the truths? Things are not a simple as they may initially seem.
This is a quirky production, y'know the type, kinda colourful in a cartoon postcard kind of way with an optimistic voiceover from our main character.
It is not one of those heavy, heavy expose's investigating the workings of huge corporations with tense court scenes and the like.
No, the touch is certainly kept light and the subject-matter all the more interesting because it focuses in on the individual rather than the faceless corporate edifice.
Not laugh-out-loud despite being described as a comedy, but reasonably entertaining and worth checking out."
The Adjustment Bureau,2011,7.0,The relationship between a politician and a contemporary dancer is affected by mysterious forces keeping them apart.,"Jan 11: I was invited to see and rate this movie at a free audience screening. While biting the hand that feeds you is incredibly bad form, this film is not worth paying a full price admission. DO see it on the big screen, but go to the matin√©e instead.Caveat, I'm not the target audience, (and hadn't read the short story source first) so for you to calibrate: I rated Jumper at 7; Avatar at 6 bumped up to an 8 for CGI; and Last Airbender at 3.This film has all the individual elements for a great time: The opening draws you into the story; Blunt is engaging and sensual; Stamp is villainous; Damon/Blunt have fabulous chemistry including a great meet; initial mystery, sophisticated humor, snappy repartee, wonderful score, and superb scenery. The supporting characters are well cast and acted. However, the thin plot doesn't sustain the whole movie, and it takes too long for the minimal plot to unfold, even though there are myriad chase scenes to divert you at first.The movie was seemingly created for chase scenes, with a poorly contrived reason for the ""boy meets girl, boy loses girl but continues to search for her storyline"", tossed in to justify all the chasing. In attempting to make everything mysterious, the audience is kept as ignorant as the characters to the point where it became ""THATS the reason he's been chasing after her? How DISAPPOINTING!"" when the cause for separation is unveiled. The secret meetings which presumably either advance or reveal the mystery were annoying instead. Finally, in the last portion of the movie, the opening doors and running become so repetitive, you can feel like the Blunt character, who has her hands over her head and is screaming. The ending is abrupt, contrived and disappointing, a veritable deus ex machina version.Conversely, my companion who loves everything sci-fi or sci-fantasy, and reads Phillip K Dick (including the short story on which this was based) rated the movie ""excellent"" as opposed to my ""ok"". Even though the movie diverges from the short story, he suffered no confusion or disappointment with the story line, big reveals, or ending. He also thought the cast, romance, and humor were great.We both agree--do see the movie on the big screen as it certainly enhances the suspense and startling moments (political crowd scene, adjustment scene, car crashes, action scenes and finale) and shows off the great NYC locations. He says go ahead and pay full price,the movie is worth it"
The Five-Year Engagement,2012,6.2,"One year after meeting, Tom proposes to his girlfriend, Violet, but unexpected events keep tripping them up as they look to walk down the aisle together.","I went into this film with low expectations. Very rarely do I actually take the time to watch romantic comedies but this one had such an excellent cast that I decided to give it a try. So glad I did. This film is fantastic. It knows when to be smart and it knows when to be serious, and both of these things it pulls off perfectly.Probably the thing that surprised me the most about this film was the fantastic chemistry between Jason Segal and Emily Blunt. I never would have guessed that they could work so well with each other! Chris Pratt and Alison Brie are also great together. In fact, the whole cast is great. It was very refreshing to see Kevin Hart in a smaller role in which it didn't feel like he was trying the steal the entire scene.The only reason that I took two stars off my review is because I did feel at times that the pacing was a little bit off. Some of the scenes probably could have been tightened up a bit to make them that much more effective and there may have been a few short scenes that weren't really needed. This is my only real complaint about the film.Overall, I highly recommend this movie. Though it is quite long for a comedy, it's also totally worth it. ""The Five-Year Engagement"" has a lot of charm to it and also has a very interesting metaphor tied into the plot. The film has a great story, a great cast, and should make for a great date night movie!"
Kis Vuk,2008,1.3,A young fox's world turns upside down when a circus captures his father and other woodland creatures. He teams up with a disabled boy and an acrobat girl to save the animals and reunite his family.,"Even if this ugly thing does not even looks like a cartoon movie, probably been a prosperous business - if money laundering and wasting national sponsorship is considered to be a success. This is a picture perfect specimen of the deeply rooted corruption that so sadly penetrates its developer country at all level.Don't be mistaken, it is simply not a movie to watch, its sole purpose was described above. Frankly, it still has a positive side: so very filled with primitive errors that you definitely not want to commit if you ever make animated films that you can actually learn from it. However, it is quite long for a ""how-not-to-do-a-cartoon"" tutorial, and there are continuously repeating faults that are tiresome.Truly a visual poison, should be forbidden to minors, its not made for them. It is made for the money, and the money only."
The Muppets,2011,7.1,A Muppet fanatic with some help from his 2 human compatriots must regroup the Muppet gang to stop an avaricious oil mogul from taking down one of their precious life-longing treasures.,"Warm, charming and funny, just like the Muppets I remember from my childhood. I'm not often one for musicals, but this one - aided by the brilliant combination of fuzzy puppet singers and Flight of the Conchords composition - hits all the right notes. It's funny without nudging into blue territory, a talent that's becoming more scarce by the minute, with a heartwarming reunion storyline that slowly reintroduces the cast and reminds us why we grew to love them in the first place. Loaded with unexpected cameos and sly winks at the troupe's long history, it's clear that a lot of love went into the making of this picture; the screen positively resonates from beginning to end. Though I was hesitant to revisit this old territory at first, by the final act I was grinning warmly and nodding right along, utterly entranced."
√Ålom.net,2009,1.3,"Once-popular girl Regina needs to make new friends at her conservation new school. Problems arise when she makes an enemy of L√≠via, the school's queen bee, and falls in love with M√°rk, a musician. And as if those weren't enough of a start, she decides to organize a cheerleading team.","Even though I heard from many independent and reliable sources that this movie is bad, nay, one of the worst high-budget films ever made, I was skeptical. I have now watched it and can confirm it as one of the all-time low of international filmmaking. A drama without a single trace of suspense or excitement, a love story without a single romantic line, a teen comedy with very few traces of very trite and embarrassing humor, this movie is a MUST. Without having seen it, one will forever lack the experience of a truly, authentically, genuinely bad film.The only mystery that remains is who on earth sponsored this celluloid waste and what on earth made some of Hungary's prominent comic actors (notably G√°bor Reviczky) subscribe to it.To sum up: the trite and/or hilariously out-of-place dialogs, the embarrassing discontinuities, and the sub-YouTube-dilettante quality of acting and directing make it difficult to believe that this movie was ever meant to be taken seriously to any degree, but the lack of even the slightest trace of irony leaves one with no other option than to assume that it was."
Unknown,2011,6.8,"When a man awakens from a coma only to discover that someone has taken on his identity, he teams up with a young woman to prove who he is.","Beforehand I didnt expect anything from this movie, I just wanted to watch a B-movie, with lots of action and thrills, to keep me awake. But I got more than I expected, and although I was sleepy when I started watching it, I was wide awake midway through. This is just another one of those unmistakable well made Liam Neeson thrillers.If you liked the Liam Neeson Taken series then you will surely love this movie as well. It' s fast, suspenseful and with lots of slick and cool looking photography and editing. I mention these technical details, because lots of action movies just dont get it right when it comes to fastpaced action photography. This one does.Liam Neeson travels abroad with his wife for business. He gets into a car accident by himself and when he wakes up in a hospital, someone else has taken his identity.This story might sound ridiculous, and for sure, it is a bit of a ridiculous story, but it is executed in such a way that is still quite suspenseful and captivating.There are many resemblances with the Bourne movies. Memory loss, being chased by assasins in foreign countries (Germany), fast action sequences and lots of suspense. It is a really decent action thriller, which the fans of this genre will surely have a good time with. It is a bit better than the average action movie, although dont expect originality either..."
Get Him to the Greek,2010,6.3,A record company intern is hired to accompany out-of-control British rock star Aldous Snow to a concert at L.A.'s Greek Theater.,"This movie was great. I expected considering how much I enjoyed Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and how much I enjoy Jonah Hill in general. I was not disappointed. The only reason that I did not give this movie a higher rating was because it was so ridiculous and unbelievable. I could not stop laughing out loud in the theater and neither could the rest of the audience (which was decent sized for a mid week night time showing after release). If you do not like drinking, drugs, and sex than I would recommend that you do not even come close to this one. It is above the top in all three of those aspects. You may be offended by some things, but that is the whole point of the movie... enjoy it. See it soon, I foresee this one growing in popularity as word of mouth spreads. 8/10."
Captain Phillips,2013,7.8,"The true story of Captain Richard Phillips and the 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates of the U.S.-flagged MV Maersk Alabama, the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in two hundred years.","Paul Greengrass has proved his talents with two fantastic Bourne films, The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, and two impressive real-life dramas, Bloody Sunday and United 93. Green Zone, while being a little like Bourne in Baghdad, was also a worthy thriller. Captain Phillips sees Greengrass deliver another true story to the big screen, proving that he is indeed the current king of cinematic re-enactments.Tom Hanks gives one of his finest performances in a long time. His Captain Phillips is a professional, serious man that keeps his emotions in check while sternly ensuring his crew understands his expectations. As the situation escalates, his emotions begin to creep through. Leading towards a final release that is both heartbreaking and relieving. Hanks' character isn't explored too deeply, but we are nevertheless with him every step of the way.In a fantastic casting choice, Tom Hanks is more than matched by Barkhad Abdi, who truly shines as the lead pirate. We're given more access than expected to this character ‚Äì to all four pirates for that matter. Abdi manages to evoke empathy from a character that could have easily succumbed to stereotypical villainy. His performance provides a complex level of emotion to the proceedings. He knows that the situation has easily ran away from him, yet he naively decides to re-assure himself ‚Äì and Captain Phillips ‚Äì every chance he gets.This is no-nonsense filmmaking of the highest order. Paul Greengrass' kinetic camera rises above the sometimes dizzying approach from some of his last films. The hand-held factor works beautifully here, ensuring the you-are-there level of realism is cranked to a ten at every second. As the events escalate, we are always kept aware of what is happening. While skipper jargon and navy terms are exclaimed every which way, care is placed on making sure we still know exactly what is going on. Billy Ray (Breach, State of Play, The Hunger Games) constructs a taut and clear screenplay that compliments Greengrass' filmmaking style.To call this tense is an understatement. Henry Jackman's score pushes every sequence to an almost unbearable level of tension, Barry Ackroyd's cinematography beautifully captures the sweat and intensity of every moment, and Christopher Rouse's masterful editing brings it all home.Exhausting and thrilling, Captain Phillips is all the more powerful with the knowledge that you're witnessing a true story. Paul Greengrass and co. have crafted an experiential film that you won't be forgetting in a hurry.thereelword.net"
Taken 2,2012,6.2,"In Istanbul, retired CIA operative Bryan Mills and his wife are taken hostage by the father of a kidnapper Mills killed while rescuing his daughter.","The movie was very good and Liam Neeson is one my favourite actors. it is great that Liam Neeson visited Turkey. I am sure that he impressed very much while he was there. However I just hated director's point of view about Istanbul, and Turkey. In some scenes you see some women wearing pitch black clothes as if they live in a country governed by Islamic rules . No!!! Turkey is not like that!!! Its constitution is more democratic than many 'democratic' countries in the world. And especially women had their rights before many 'democratic' countries in the world. For example Turkish women can vote or can be elected since 1934! Just check the history. You will see Turkish women had such rights before millions of others women living in other countries. But, I do not understand why there is not any Turkish women seen in the movie. All the movie was taken in very weird and suburban areas, and you do not see any women, but the guys. This is not Iran, this is Istanbul! I am very sorry about the director's attitude and I did not like it at all.Turkey is a secular, democratic and modern country. You can see the people with very modern looking all over the city, not ninjas! The people of Turkey do not wear such a pitch black clothes like the people living in an Islamic country. Not only the appearance, but also the thoughts are modern and contemporary in Turkey! Why did director say a big lie to the world? Is there a political reason? Should a director act like a horrible politician?I am fed up with seeing such horrible movies hiding the truth! Make movie of what you see, not hide the truth!Movie certainly deserves 7 out of 10, but the director does not deserve even 0!I hope my review was useful to correct some mistakes/lies about Istanbul..."
Hitchcock,2012,6.8,The relationship between Alfred Hitchcock and his wife Alma Reville during the filming of Psycho (1960) in 1959 is explored.,"A love story between influential filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock (Anthony Hopkins) and wife Alma Reville (Alma Reville) during the filming of Psycho (1960) in 1959 . As Alfred decides his next film will adapt the lurid horror novel, Psycho by Robert Bloch , but the novel's inspiration haunts his dreams , including the series killer Ed Gein (Michael Wincott) , then Alma finally loses patience .The film mainly deals with filming ¬®Psycho¬® , Hithcock masterpiece and his most accomplished and perfect movie . Psycho was not only Hitchcock's biggest successful movie,but was a phenomenon in its own right , the picture is a magnum opus of the terror genre and its immediate impact and its future influence was enormous and cannot be over emphasised . It also concerns on the relationship between Hitch and his wife Alma Reville , perfectly played by Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren respectively . Helen Mirren had met the real Alfred Hitchcock when he approached her for a part as a murder victim in his penultimate film, Frenzi (1972) ; Mirren turned down the role, a decision she later regretted. Although many reviewers criticized the film for inventing an intimate relationship between Alma Reville and Whitfield Cook, the facts are documented by more than one Hitchcock scholar, as exemplified by Patrick McGilligan in his biography of Alfred Hitchcock. There are developed various scenes about ¬®Psycho ¬®shooting as when Marion (Scarlett Johansson as Janet Leigh) leaves her fianc√©e and heads with her car toward California , when is caught in a storm she leaves the highway and enter to Bates hotel . The hotel with twelve rooms (and 12 showers) is managed by a strange young named Norman (James D'Arcy as Anthony Perkins) who seems to be submitted by his overbearing mother . The shower images are well recreated , these scenes are one of the most studied ,copied and analysed sequences in cinema history and has obtained a notoriety what exceeds of the movie itself. The character of Ed Gein was included in the original screenplay. In subsequent drafts, the role of Gein was either eliminated completely or reduced in importance. Terrific acting by Anthony Hopkins as Hitch and sensitive performance by Mirren as Alma , in fact , this movie is a perceptive homage to a great screenwriter , and Hitch's supporter , Alma Reville . The movie has a fine support cast playing notorious characters who had an important role on Hitch films such as Jessica Biel as Vera Miles , Toni Collette as Peggy Robertson , Michael Stuhlbarg as Lew Wasserman , Ralph Macchio as screen writer Joseph Stefano , Wallace Langham as Saul Bass , Paul Schackman as Bernard Herrmann and Spencer Garrett as George Tomasini . Nice production design , as scenes set in Alfred Hitchcock's Paramount suite of offices were filmed in Hitchcock's actual office on that studio's lot.Colorful as well as evocative cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth . Lively and atmospheric musical score by Danny Elffmann . The picture was well directed by Sacha Gervasi ; it was shot in 36 days with exquisite taste and intelligence by the master Hitchcock who makes an impeccable control of every scene and maneuvers your emotions, infusing with a deliciously wit and ironic"
The Scarlet Letter,1995,5.3,An affair between a young woman and a pastor has disastrous consequences.,"For starters, I have read Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter, both for high school and personal enjoyment, and I absolutely loved the novel, but most high school students would disagree with my view of the novel.  When seeing this film, one must remember the phrase ""freely adapted from,"" because that's what it is.  Things are changed, yes, but that doesn't stop this movie from being wonderful.  The movie gives background to the Hester/Dimmesdale romance that Hawthorne left in the background, and so beings the tale to life and makes it more understandable to the modern population.  Depsite its inaccuracies and liberal use of literary lisence, the movie is a hypothetical ""What if?""  It asks what would have happened had Dimmesdale come forward, had Pearl been a more congenial, innocent character, and had the Indian troubles played more of a part in Hawthorne's work.  As Dimmesdale, Oldman performs marvelously, depicting the tortured soul of the Puritan priest in love with a strong, undaunted woman.  This movie is a must see for all the historical romance lovers out there as well as those who need a reprieve from Hawthorne's often long and difficult prose.  Just don't use it to pass your tests; that's what Sparknotes are for..."
The Theory of Everything,2014,7.7,Stephen Hawking gets unprecedented success in the field of physics despite being diagnosed with motor neuron disease at the age of 21. He defeats awful odds as his first wife Jane aids him loyally.,"The Theory of Everything tells the uphill struggle that world renowned genius Stephen Hawking went through when dealing with his, now, infamous disease and trying to maintain his relationship with his loving wife, Jane. The strengths of this film rely solely on Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. These two actors are absolutely, one hundred percent, PHENOMENAL in these two roles. Stephen Hawking is the role that Redmayne was born to play. Hawking is portrayed as a charming and intellectually superior individual that behaves just like any one else. After a bit, we start to wonder what was every so amazing about him...then the heartbreak starts. Jane Hawking is a sweet, loving and determined person that will go to the lengths of the universe to make sure her husband, Stephen can survive. I get chills just thinking about certain scenes, some of which will most definitely be requiring a large box of Kleenex. The truth is, anything that I say here about these performances, no matter what it is, is still criminally underselling the sheer brilliance of them. Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones are simply incredible and I'd be even willing to go to the extreme to say that both actors will not only be nominated, but I'd be surprised if they didn't win the Oscar gold. Now, with that being said, this film's structural issues are severely hampering this film's chances at being a classic. I wasn't completely sold on the structural integrity of the film. It showed enough of the relationship aspect behind Stephen and Jane but it very briefly touched base on Hawking's intellectual discoveries and I thought that if it was a bit more balanced in that respect, it would be a near perfect film. One plot point that I did find utterly enthralling is the idea that Hawking struggles throughout the film to do simple things. These scenes are, by far, the most heart wrenching scenes to watch. James Marsh directs his actors effortlessly and can evoke the type of emotional response out of his audience through them, but when left with telling a story, Marsh falters. Marsh, known for 2012 IRA drama, Shadow Dancer proves that he is an actor's director. He cares about human drama over anything in a tangible sense, which benefits this film greatly but also harms it in the way of progression. Despite these minor infractions, The Theory of Everything is a film that everyone can enjoy and turns into a real audience movie. It is a film that will have you laughing one minute and crying the next, no easy feat for any film, and this one does it effortlessly."
In Good Company,2004,6.5,A middle-aged ad exec is faced with a new boss who's nearly half his age... and who also happens to be sleeping with his daughter.,"Got in to see one of those audience recruited screenings. I was expecting sort of vanilla type movie, but was VERY PLEASANTLY SURPRISED...it is GOOD! Not superb, but definitely fun, original and very very topical! Dennis Quaid plays an ad exec whose company is taken over by a big conglomerate. Topher Grace, who is half Dennis' age, becomes his boss, and we see the dramatic and comedic dynamic (too may ""ics"") of the two men as they try to cope with an in flux work and home life. Dennis Quaid and Scarlett Johansson are very good, but Topher Grace is the body slam surprise performance here. Also, as a bonus for the audience, all the supporting cast is filled in with great character actors. I hate spending ten bucks on a ho-hum movie, but this one is definitely worth it. Story-9, Acting-8, Humor-9, Drama-8....OVERALL: 8.5"
Legends of the Fall,1994,7.5,"In the early 1900s, three brothers and their father living in the remote wilderness of Montana are affected by betrayal, history, love, nature, and war.","I can't believe the bad reviews Legends of the Fall got when it was released. This would have to be one of the best movies around. Everything from the acting to the directing was brilliant and the scenery was breathtaking.Anthony Hopkins gave another knockout performance as Colonel Ludlow and Brad Pitt was brilliant as Tristan.Aidan Quinn, Henry Thomas and Julia Ormond were perfectly cast as Alfred, Samuel and Susanna.The one thing I liked most about this movie was the ending - which I won't spoil. It is rare when watching a movie, you cannot pick the ending. The ending to this movie was so amazing, and the fact that it wasn't obvious what was going to happen made this movie more enjoyable.James Horner is a master. Just like he did with Titanic, the score for Legends of the Fall took the movie to another level."
Home Alone 3,1997,4.6,"Alex Pruitt, an 8-year-old boy living in Chicago, must fend off four international criminals who are seeking a top-secret microchip in his toy car.","This is NOT part 3 of ""Kevin's Adventures"", but rather a brand new ""home Alone"" situation. The setting is still suburban Chicago during the Christmas season, the family is still ""upper middle class"", and even the theme music is very similar to the predecessors. This time, however, the ""kid"" is NOT abandoned by his entire family who took off for their Christmas Vacation. This time our pint sized hero is left unattended only for hours at a time, while he is at home and sick with the measles. A gang of foreign spys is after a top secret multi-million dollar computer chip stolen from the US Air Force. Of course, they hide it in a battery-operated toy that ends up with ""the kid"".Although the ""boobie trap"" routine could be viewed as just another rip-off from the first two films, the ""gags"" seem a bit more sophisticated and less forced in ""3"". The mere fact that our hero is not dealing with ""wet bandit idiots"" this time around makes the whole show less of a ""kiddie circus"". The third running is also leaving out the mushy side plots which would've gotten tiresome by now. All in all this is a fun show for the whole family. I showed this film to my 4th grade class and they gave it 20 thumbs up. Not for the ""grown-up"" comedy critic, but definitely a winner with kids."
Secret Window,2004,6.5,A successful writer in the midst of a painful divorce is stalked at his remote lake house by a would-be scribe who accuses him of plagiarism.,"Secret Window's tag line ¬ñ ""Some windows should never be opened"" ¬ñ is so snarkily appropriate in its unintentional damning of this ridiculously overwrought psychothriller that it's a wonder some smart underling at Columbia hasn't leapfrogged up the studio ladder by pointing it out to the powers that be. Their error is the critics' gain, though, and even the presence of Johnny Depp, as novelist Mort Rainey, can't save this film from its own unintended melodramatics. Secret Window lacks a B-movie sucker punch, and by the final reel it degenerates into a hackneyed mishmash of obvious revelations and cheap, ineffective horror theatrics despite Depp's mangy fun. There's no car crash in this one as in his current television project Kingdom Hospital and much of his recent writing ¬ñ King penned it before that wayward van almost took him out of the running forever ¬ñ but the film itself is an effective enough metaphor for out-of-control bs that frankly was part and parcel of King's novella from page one."
Mallrats,1995,7.0,"Both dumped by their girlfriends, two best friends seek refuge in the local mall.","I was originally going to write how ""Clerks"" managed to accomplish allot more than Mallrats with a much much smaller budget, but why kill the fun. This movie is great and a welcome addition to the world that Kevin Smith has created.  Instead of the wise-ass remarks from the ""loveable"" Randal, we have the great Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee) ripping up the screen with his rude and crude observations.  Mallrats is fun, enjoyable, and the one Smith movie you don't have to pay attention to, to enjoy.This movie is about TS whose girlfriend breaks up with him after they get into yet another fight.  His girlfriend's father seems to have it in for him and wants nothing more than TS and his daughter to part ways.  After the breakup TS winds up at his buddy Brodie's house.  From here it begins. Brodie will keep you laughing the rest of the way.  Jason Lee made this character and this character made the film.  Unlike in ""Clerks"", Jay & Silent Bob have a large part in this movie.  They are in charge of helping TS get back with his girlfriend, which involves much sabotage.  There is one main storyline and a couple of other ones along the way.In all this is a great movie and who cares how it was put together.  Allot of people felt it was a big jump for Kevin Smith (writer/director, Silent Bob) and Scott Mosier (producer) to go from a small independent budget to a Studio backed million-dollar budget.  I might tend to agree, but who cares, this movie Rocks"
"Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves!",,5.0,"This time, the adults have shrunk themselves, and the kids need to fix it.","This movie was really boring. First of all, the only character from the original one is Rick Moranis. If Marcia Strassman, replaced by Eve Gordon, was the mother, I would've enjoyed this movie a little more. There wasn't even Nick & Amy mentioned, except in the two minute camp discussion sequence. There were the new family included, Gordon, Wayne's brother & his family. This movie was starting to bring me down, when they got totally off-subject when Jenny's party went underway. This movie I would not suggest to anyone who's looking for a good movie (because it's not), loves sequels (because this will be the first one you don't like) & anyone over the age of ten, either sex. (because it will amaze the little ones, but it's tetious for the older ones)The only good thing was that it was a little over an hour, so if you really got sick of it, there wouldn't be much more. I own this movie, but I got it for a gift. I only watch it as a last resort."
Flightplan,2005,6.3,"A bereaved woman and her daughter are flying home from Berlin to America. At 30,000 feet, the child vanishes, and nobody will admit she was ever on the plane.","I have not seen that many Jodie Foster films, but being that she is a fairly well known actress and Flightplan's premise seemed as good as any's I gave it a shot when invited to an opening showing with two friends.What followed was a mixture between humor, failed tension, and borderline entertainment.Flightplan derives its plot from a Hitchcock standpoint: A woman (Foster) boards a plane with her daughter, falls asleep and discovers that the little girl is missing. In a frenzy to locate her missing child she frightens both crew and passengers alike in a search that may be only in her mind.Trouble is Flightplan never builds much excitement, leaving the audience caught between wondering the truth behind the film's mystery and not really caring but hoping things get interesting before everything is over.Jodie Foster plays a good anxious, worried mother and I had the urge to just reach up, slap her and say ""Cut that out!"" A well done acting role on her part that sparks empathy and emotional responses from those watching, bravo. Now if only the other characters could have been as successful...A few seconds into Foster's flight we are introduced to Pigeon Eyes,(Peter Sarsgaard) a shady looking character who explains himself to be an air marshal. He sports a monotonous disposition that could rival Hayden Christensen's Anakin Skywalker impression, except when situation demands a slightly more energetic tone of voice.The entire films manages to hold itself together without boring the viewers but not exactly showing them the time of their life either. A few predictable plot twists manage to change things up just enough to have it stand out much better than some suspense thrillers (The Interpreter with Nicole Kidman springs to mind.).Overall, Flightplan stands as an easily forgettable and average entry in the Jodie Foster film history.5/10"
Phone Booth,2002,7.1,"Publicist Stuart Shepard finds himself trapped in a phone booth, pinned down by an extortionist's sniper rifle. Unable to leave or receive outside help, Stuart's negotiation with the caller leads to a jaw-dropping climax.","Director Joel Schumacher preserves his reputation with a script by Larry Cohen about personal morals and hopefully the truth providing some kind of redemption. This is a white knuckle nerve wrecker about a self-serving publicist(Colin Farrell)making the mistake of his life by answering a public telephone. On the other end of the phone is a self empowered mad man(Kiefer Sutherland) inflicting demands on the fast talking, fast thinking publicity dealer who just happened to be walking by the phone booth he passes every day. The mystery voice on the phone demands the publicist to stay in the phone booth until he tells his wife(Radha Mitchell)and the TV watching public of his cheating, lying and making use of others. Of course behind the demanding voice is a sharpshooter that is not afraid to pull the trigger. The senior officer on the scene(Forest Whitaker)tries to make sense of the situation while fighting back thoughts of his own past personal problems. At least 90% of this thriller is made up of witty, threatening and revealing banter between Farrell and Sutherland. And talk about a clever twist to end this flick. Also of note in the cast are: Katie Holmes, Richard T. Jones and Paula Jai Parker. Think twice about answering that ringing phone."
The Air I Breathe,2007,6.7,"A drama based on an ancient Chinese proverb that breaks life down into four emotional cornerstones: happiness, pleasure, sorrow and love. A businessman bets his life on a horse race; a gangster sees the future; a pop star falls prey to a crime boss; a doctor must save the love of his life.","First of all, this film did have problems. There were a lot of flaws, and some of the coincidences seemed stupid and irrelevant, but it does not fail to show emotion. The emotions are all scattered. Not just one person can have one, and I think that is the point of the film. My first time seeing it, i thought it was just a GOOD film. After seeing it over three times, i can really say it is a very great film. The Acting is phenomenal, and Sarah Michelle Gellar gives her best performance to date. She really shows what she is capable of. She portrays the right signs of Sorrow. Andy Garcia was also great. The direction, from a first time director, was really amazing. The were a lot of beautiful scenes, great cinematography. It is a pleasure to watch. Some of the songs played, are kinda cheesy, but those songs go away fast. BUT the score is truly amazing. It totally captures the right feel that the film portrayed. The film should have been longer. It was only 90 minutes, it was very fast paced. They should have shown more screen time with Gellar and Bacon. The rushed feeling has a positive side to it. The film never gets boring. It grabs you completely(and for some people, that is what they want). Yes, the biggest problem is the screenplay, which at times seems silly, some of the dialogue, but the film also has powerful moments and some GREAT dialogue(sort of like the 2004 film Crash). Overall, I have fallen in love with it. It is very underrated, and some of the negative feedback it has received is not worth it. See it, expect flaws, but see it expecting something big, something about human complexity, and you will not be disappointed."
Disturbia,2007,6.8,A bored teenager under house arrest starts spying on his neighbors and discovers one of them might be a serial killer.,"This movie was extremely well paced -- there was very good character development without excessive dialog. The story is exciting and thrilling: a modernized Rear Window. The acting was very solid, and every actor, major or minor, sold their part. Shia LeBeouf was a likable protagonist, Carrie-Anne Moss did a great job in her role as the mother, and David Morse played an exceedingly ominous and creepy neighbor. The climax is very suspenseful, although it did contain a few minor lapses in rational behavior by both the heroes and the villain, but I suppose that could be written off as desperation. Overall, it was refreshing to see a well-paced thriller with great suspense, humor, and character development."
Big Miracle,2012,6.5,"In small-town Alaska, a news reporter recruits his Greenpeace-volunteer ex-girlfriend on a campaign to save a family of gray whales trapped by rapidly-forming ice in the Arctic Circle.","Big Miracle looks deceiving due to its advertising. Looking like a sappy, clich√©d mess of a cash in. Even at first impression, it's deceiving. Characters like the oft-seen charismatic ex-boyfriend, the spunky animal rights activist, the street-smart young kid, the pretty fish out of water journalist, the local elderly wiseman, the mean old oil tycoon turned good guy, the unlikely geniuses who provide comic relief, and even the self-absorbed douchebag news anchor had me fearing for its quality.However, something about this true story just sticks. The script is overly clich√©d, but there's a surprising heart and lack of cheap corniness to it that feels more honest than its sappy sounding premise may let on. It also boasts another surprising element: actual intelligence. It may not be groundbreaking, but it's done plenty of justice by an excellent cast. Even if it's not always focused, the powerful ending is happily earned, adding up to a satisfying family drama.***1/2 / *****"
Don Jon,2013,6.5,"A New Jersey guy dedicated to his family, friends, and church, develops unrealistic expectations from watching porn and works to find happiness and intimacy with his potential true love.","""Don Jon"" (formerly known as ""Don Jon's Addiction"") is the feature directorial debut of the talented and ridiculously charismatic Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He also wrote the script and plays the title character, a young man from New Jersey who's developed: a) an unhealthy addiction to porn; and b) such unrealistic expectations about sex and love (and sex) that not even a ""10"" like Barbara (a hilarious Scarlett Johansson, in what is easily her best work since ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"") can satisfy him in real life.""Don Jon"" reminded me of a great, half-forgotten French film: Bertrand Blier's ""Too Beautiful for You"" (1989). In that film, a wealthy car dealer (Gerard Depardieu) who has everything ‚Äì including a beautiful wife (Carole Bouquet) ‚Äì falls for his plain, slightly overweight secretary (Josiane Balasko). ""Don Jon"" is also like Blier's film in the sense that Jon finds his ""10,"" yet he's still unsatisfied. Both films are very different in tone, aesthetics, and geography, but they delicately touch in the realm of our own emotional misconceptions and immaturity. We live in a world where our ever-growing concern about self-image, and the belief that we must abide by unattainable beauty standards in order to find a decent match, have grown so out-of-hand that all we ever do is find obstacles to getting to know anyone who doesn't meet our own ridiculous requirements. We are always waiting for the illusory perfection. Levitt sharply illustrates this issue by way of porn addiction; it might be crude for some, but he manages not to fall into excessive vulgarity or toilet humor.Also featuring the always wonderful Julianne Moore in an important role, plus Glenne Headly (I've missed her on the big screen), Tony Danza, and Brie Larson as Jon's parents and sister, respectively; ""Don Jon"" is worth the visit. Here's hoping for more JGL directorial efforts!"
De Rouille et d'Os,2012,7.4,"Put in charge of his young son, Alain leaves Belgium for Antibes to live with his sister and her husband as a family. Alain's bond with Stephanie, a killer whale trainer, grows deeper after Stephanie suffers a horrible accident.","¬®What have you done with my legs? ¬®Forget about Amour, Once Upon a Time in Anatolia, or A Royal Affair; the best foreign films of 2012 came from France. The first was The Intouchables, about a quadriplegic millionaire who hires the help of a young man from the projects, while Rust and Bone centers around another unlikely relationship between a killer whale trainer and a boxer. These two were my favorite foreign films by far, and I especially enjoyed this one because I am a huge fan of director Jacques Audiard who in 2009 directed the Oscar nominated A Prophet. That film was much more suspenseful as it centered on a prisoner who manages to survive inside a corrupted prison system. This time, Audiard focuses on a dramatic romantic story between two tortured souls who truly learn to live after they have suffered severe physical injuries. More than a character study, this film is a soul study as the two lead characters find healing under extremely rare circumstances. We are introduced to these characters in a very realistic manner. These people are afflicted in some way or another; they aren't your usual likable lead characters; they are deeply flawed, but we sympathize with them. Like he did in A Prophet, Audiard adapted the screenplay with the assistance of Thomas Bidegain based on the short stories from Canadian author Craig Davidson. Audiard's film was nominated for the Palm d'Or in last year's Cannes Film Festival and is really worth checking out. Some people had an issue with the ending because they thought everything fit together a little too neatly, but I thought the final act was probably the best and most satisfying part of this film. Our physical struggles and bonds can end up strengthening our tortured souls and making us better human beings.A former boxer, Alain (Matthias Schoenaerts from Bullhead), decides to move from Belgium to the south of France where his sister, Louise (Celine Sallette), lives after he is put in charge of his young son, Sam (Armand Verdure). He isn't very responsible, so he knows his sister can help him raising his son while he finds a job. He finds one as a local bouncer at a disco where he meets Stephanie (Marion Cotillard), a professional killer whale trainer at Marineland, after escorting her back home due to a brawl. They exchange numbers but don't see each other again. Alain find a job as a security guard at a local store where he meets Martial (Bouli Lanners) who convinces him to begin fighting again. Martial runs an underground kickboxing tournament where he introduces Alain and they begin making some money off it. Meanwhile Stephanie continues her life at the marine land, until she suffers a freak accident and loses both her legs. Heavily depressed she calls Alain and the two begin to form a special bond. She begins to go out more and even joins Alain when he goes off to fight. The two begin to support each other, and despite their brokenness they begin to help each other out.Audiard is a master at creating depth and pays close attention to these random characters that end up bonding with each other, but he couldn't have succeeded if it weren't for the two terrific lead performances from Matthias Schoenaerts and Marion Cotillard. Cotillard was remarkable and should have received a nomination, and somehow Schoenaerts manages to make his character likable despite all his flaws. There is something in the way he treats Stephanie that seems to erase all his flaws and make us want him to achieve his personal goals. The actors managed to create a rather unique and authentic relationship and for me it worked really well. Every scene that at first felt unnecessary seems to have a purpose or a symbolism later on, like the way Alain looked at Stephanie's legs when he was escorting her home. Later he wins a fight he was about to lose when he catches a glimpse of Stephanie's prosthetic legs. Somehow in the midst of pain, he finds greater strength, and that is what makes this film so appealing. Everything which seemed so random at first seems to come together perfectly at the end. This is one of those films that stay with you long after the credits roll, and it is deeply touching and moving. This is one of those films that is driven by the performances and the overall narrative of the story. The visual effects of Cotillard 's legs (or lack thereof) are also pretty well done. Everything about this film makes it one you will definitely want to check out. It is real, it is raw, and it is touching.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis,2008,7.1,"A French public servant from Provence is banished to the far North. Strongly prejudiced against this cold and inhospitable place, he leaves his family behind to relocate temporarily there, with the firm intent to quickly return.","This movie is easily the best French film that has come out in the last years. It is an excellent comedy with the two great actors Dany Boon and Kad Merad but the movie has also its philosophical, dramatical and sad parts.This movie is extremely funny, it is really difficult to make me laugh but this film made me laugh really hard several times. The best examples are when the postman and his director are having some drinks with half of the town while they deliver the letters or the scenes in the old mining town of Bergues, This movie is extremely touching and emotional. When the excellent Kad Merad tells his new partners and friends about his lies and mistakes, you feel really sad and ashamed for him. The movie's finale is also very emotional and a perfect and really philosophical conclusion.But the real star of the movie is the whole region, the Nord-Pas-de-Calais, where this movie is settled. This film presents strange and funny accents of the Sticks, their historical and charming towns, their way of living and thinking, their relation to the other parts of France and the clich√©s and prejudices about both sides. The Nord-Pas-de-Calais is more than just a part of France, it is a country within a country and a culture within a culture. I have been in this region for some weeks during an exchange program and I can tell that those people living there are mostly open-minded, very sympathetic and have many reasons to be proud of their region. I really like this movie as it reminds me of a few very positive and unforgettable memories. And I like the movie because it is different and finally a French film that doesn't present us Paris over and over again. The France is way more than just Paris and there are many beautiful and unique regions and people to discover and this successful and charming movie shows this to all the people out there.For everyone that is interested in a touching, emotional and simply profound comedy movie or anyone that likes foreign cultures and lifestyles, this unique movie is an absolute masterpiece. I hope that other French regions will follow this example and make similar movies in the future and take the focus off Paris a little bit."
Amour,2012,7.9,"Georges and Anne are an octogenarian couple. They are cultivated, retired music teachers. Their daughter, also a musician, lives in Britain with her family. One day, Anne has a stroke, and the couple's bond of love is severely tested.","In 'Amour', we delve into the deepest, and most profound type of love seldom explored on screen, examined to it's uncompromising end. It is one of the most moving displays of love, in recent memory. That the couple at the heart of this film are 80-plus year old, bourgeois, retired French-speaking music teachers is surprising. That their story speaks to so many audiences worldwide regardless of their age and culture should not be, it simply reflects the universal emotions at the core of this film told with great honesty and sensitivity.Ironically, as the title suggests, this is (not) another love story. In his most classical and refined film yet, Austrian master Haneke has once again asks questions of the audience in his own subversive, clinical, uncomfortable methods, yet (in what many see as a departure) with profoundly moving results. Some of the signature Haneke 'shocks' still remain, but this time they also carry devastating emotional weight.Paradoxically the emotional force of the film comes from Haneke's characteristic clinical style of filmmaking: static shots, framed in mid to long distance, no score, economical and direct screenplay, however assisted by an always crisp sound design, sharp lighting and cinematography courtesy of Darius Khondji (Midnight in Paris), and naturalistic and honest performances. This time however, the approach feels gentler and respectful without the standard disdain and nihilism one expects from Haneke.Yet there remains a palpable sense of the unknown and danger as film progresses (ironically almost exclusively in their spacious and comfortable apartment) ratcheting up a claustrophobic sense of fear. The film also spends it's time almost solely on the two leads, the emotional weight they carry and the connection to the audience evidenced by genuine laughter, gasps and tears (laughter or sorrow I won't disclose) was incredibly moving for two (real-life) octogenarians that few would admit, they have more in common than they would believe.I've not said much about the film's story - an elderly French couple live in a Parisian apartment until an unexpected event causes them to reevaluate their life - it is simple in it's construction and execution, and the emotional peaks are best experienced by yourself with a friend or family member and a receptive audience. I watched this at the Sydney Film Festival in June, about a month after it's premiere in Cannes in May for which it deservedly won with enthusiastic reception. The theatre was comparatively (and undeservedly) under attended, yet the reception was attentively silent, collectively moved.Following the visceral and subversive Cach√© and the more refined and sprawling White Ribbon, it appeared that Haneke had reached a creative zenith. Almost inevitably however, and especially given with the subject matter, he has restrained his somewhat acerbic style and delivered a film that is superlatively honest and sincere in all it's creative aspects. He has given an honest appraisal of a tender human relationship that should move even the most dispassionate viewer by the often unflinching humanity displayed on screen. One of the greatest and profound achievements seen on screen in many years, this is film at it's purest and most powerful form."
Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut,2006,7.6,"Superman agrees to sacrifice his powers to start a relationship with Lois Lane, unaware that three Kryptonian criminals he inadvertently released are conquering Earth.","This should have been the original Superman II! When you watch it, you finally understand what the hell Superman and his father have been saying all these years. It all makes sense now. Having grown up on Superman, I feel cheated!!! I had to wait until now to finally understand one of my favorite film series! It's just a crime!Not only does Donner's film flow better and enlighten the viewer, it even makes those annoying villains have more purpose. Even as a kid, I thought they were ridiculous. They're still ridiculous in this film, but Donner links them more clearly to Superman's past, so you get pulled into the plot line more.Watch this film and you'll see my point."
Bridge to Terabithia,2007,7.2,"Leslie and Jess create the secret kingdom of Terabithia, a land of monsters, trolls, ogres and giants where they spend their free time ruling as king and queen and fighting evil creatures.",I think the previews were misleading yes .But i was very glad that there was a story instead of a bunch of bad digital junk .Most of the people in the theater were crying. Sad yes but meaningful. Well written and very likable cast .Very brave .My girlfriend and i were the only two adults without kids and i thought this really is a kids movie but by the end i would have to say it was a little much for kids under 6 or 7 it is a very sad movie .The location was very pleasing .The two main girls were very well cast very engaging and you will see the boy in upcoming films as he is a very sellable kid .I would have to say well worth the price of a ticket
Jack Frost,1998,5.5,"A father who can't keep his promises is killed in a car accident. One year later, he returns as a snowman who has the final chance to put things right with his son before he is gone forever.","I will never understand why so many viewers dislike ""Jack Frost."" It is a movie with heart warming and refreshing storyline. Michael Keaton stars as Jack Frost in this awesome movie about getting a second chance at being the world's greatest dad. Kelly Preston, Joseph Cross and Mark Addy co-star.I first noticed Joseph Cross, Charlie Frost, in the 100th episode of ""Touched By An Angel"" and since then I knew he was a talented young actor. Cross once again teamed with Keaton in ""Desperate Measures"" another awesome movie overlooked by the viewing audience.""Jack Frost"" is the kind of movie that has heart-warming moments intertwined with comedic wit. Keaton and Cross seem to have a lot of fun making this movie together and it showed in their performances. Scenes like the one that had Jack Frost throwing snowballs at the school bully and his friends as well as the chase that followed made it all worthwhile to see because this is what makes movies so good.Watching this movie, it reminded me of ""Ghost"" because of its sweeping and heartwarming storyline.Chemistry is one of the elements I look for in a great movie. ""Jack Frost"" has this element and more. While an unusual but a brilliant pairing, Keaton and Preston bring chemistry to ""Jack Frost,"" a movie that seems to be better than others I've seen before.I think Michael Keaton is one of the best actors I've seen and his performance in ""Jack Frost"" is one of his best films to date so WATCH it."
xXx,2002,5.9,"The US government recruits extreme sports athlete Xander Cage to infiltrate a Russian criminal ring, which is plotting the destruction of the world.","This blockbuster concerns about Xander Cage, a macho-man with natural athletic abilities, he's an extreme-sports expert. When he is by force recruited by NSA agent Gibbons(Samuel L. Jackson) for dangerous mission and as avoid going to jail but he has some problems with the law . Xander can succeed where other US Government agents have failed. He must to go underground Praga and infiltrate as undercover agent into Russian ring called Anarchy 99, led by a ruthless mobster(Marton Csokas) who uses nuclear weapons. Xander Cage must combat a cruel enemy far beyond his possibilities, he's only helped by a gorgeous girl(Asia Argento). Furthermore, Xander is supplied with technological arms by an agent(Michael Roof), similar to Q-James Bond.The film contains high-energy action, noisy thrills, struggles, emotion and spectacular scenes. It's over-the-top action movie plenty of explosions, firepower, gun-play and breathtaking pursuits as when a motorcycle runs afoul with bounds and leaps. The picture is stirring and exciting, though also a routine actioner with no much sense. Tough Diesel as one army man is cool, he's co-executive producer. Lively musical score by Randy Edelman , adding hard rock, heavy metal and disco-music. The film is produced with high budget by Neal H. Moritz, an action movies producer and usual of Rob Cohen movies. Cohen is a nice director of hits, such as ¬®Stealth, Fast and furious, Daylight, Skulls, Dragonheart¬® among others. It's followed by an inferior sequel starred by Ice Cube and again with Samuel L Jackson and directed by Lee Tamahori."
The Legend of Zorro,2005,6.0,"Despite trying to keep his swashbuckling to a minimum, a threat to California's pending statehood causes the adventure-loving Don Alejandro de la Vega and his wife, Elena, to take action.","Considering that the first one was absolutely terrific in delivering top notch action and delivering a solid story, this sequel is surprisingly average. The film has the feel and good ideas of the first, but the film mostly feels strained and forced. The film is still an entertaining film but its also disappointing in the fact that the first one was so good. I thought The Legend Of Zorro delivered average action and an average plot, I felt that there was nothing special about the film. The film feels like they're trying to outdo the first one which of course was great. This sequel is at times silly and really doesn't live up to the original. Overall the film is bordeline good fun, it's nothing truly excellent or good. The film is average. I found the acting to be quite sloppy too. The kid annoyed me and he was probably written into the script to give the film a ""needed"" edge that almost every sequel needs, a kid that gets himself into a shitload of trouble for the sake of putting the main characters at risk. This is too bad, because The Legend Of Zorro could have been something truly terrific, but the end results is that of a strained sequel that tries to overdue it's predecessor. The Legend Of Zorro will disappoint fans of the first, and some will think that this is an average or mediocre film with a watered down plot. Borderline decent, but not good or great at all. I was disappointed."
The Flintstones,1994,5.0,"In a parallel modern-day Stone Age world, a working-class family, the Flintstones, are set up for an executive job. But they learn that money can't buy happiness.","""The Flintstones"" is a film that tries hard to be likeable and succeeds for the most part, but with that said this is only a fair film at best.  The cartoons come to real live and the nostalgia carries some of the film. However, the paper-thin plot destroys any chance that the film has to be a complete success.  Naive Fred Flintstone (John Goodman) has been promoted and is now a big-time businessman.  Of course the villains, Halle Berry and Kyle MacLachlan, are just using Fred to steal from Mr. Slate's company. Wilma (Elizabeth Perkins) quickly becomes jealous of Berry, but overlooks everything because Fred is raking in the cash.  Barney Rubble (Rick Moranis) meanwhile is unemployed because he had the lowest score on an IQ test (he actually switched tests with Fred because Fred had lent him money to adopt Bamm-Bamm).  Throughout his financial crisis, Betty (Rosie O'Donnell) stands beside him.  Fred finally becomes wise to what is going on, but MacLachlan has a devious scheme up his sleeve.  All in all ""The Flintstones"" is a good looking film with high production values, but ultimately the screenplay and direction cannot save this film.  The characters play well on television, but are somewhat out of their element on the big screen.  The cast is hard-working in spite of the fact the material is just not present.  2.5 out of 5 stars."
Mona Lisa Smile,2003,6.6,Katherine Watson teaches art history in 1953 at the respectable all-female Wellesley College. She encourages her conservative students to question and disregard the outdated societal mores for women.,"In 1953, free spirited and non-orthodox art history teacher Katherine Ann Watson (Julia Roberts) accepts the challenge of teaching in the conservative Wellesley College. She leaves her boy-friend Paul Moore (John Slattery) in California and share a house with the teacher Nancy Abbey (Marcia Gay Harden) and the nurse Amanda (Juliet Stevenson).On the first day, her class fails under the leadership of the arrogant Betty Warren (Kirsten Dunst) and her friends Joan Brandwyn (Julia Stiles) and Giselle Levy (Maggie Gyllenhaal), but Katherine is advised by her mates and the Italian teacher Bill Dunbar (Dominic West) to not fear the students. Soon Katherine learns that the girls are only waiting to catch Mr. Nice Guy and get married and she fights against the status- quo of Wellesley and to keep her independence.""Mona Lisa Smile"" is an entertaining movie about a woman living ahead of time in a conservative environment. The performances are top-notch, highlighting Julia Roberts, Kirsten Dunst, Julia Stiles and Maggie Gyllenhaal. I bought this DVD many years ago and only today I have seen this movie recommended by a friend of mine. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Sorriso de Mona Lisa"" (""The Smile of Mona Lisa"")"
Fireflies in the Garden,2008,6.4,The Taylor family is devastated by an accident that takes place on the day their matriarch is due to graduate from college -- decades after leaving to raise her children.,"OK there two versions of this movie. The 2008 version I give 3 1/2 stars. Great score and good ending. The 2011 American release with entirely different score (score sucks), is mediocre at best. The score made the 2008 version good. I don't know why the producers ruined the original version, probably just to get an American release. I don't why Hollywood takes a potentially good idea and turns it into crap. This movie was Oscar worthy until they changed the entire me with it's crap 2011 ending. Watch the 2008 version online or import DVD...2008 9 stars. 2011= 5 1/2 stars. Crap bag producers butchered a very good movie."

Divergent,2014,6.6,"In a world divided by factions based on virtues, Tris learns she's Divergent and won't fit in. When she discovers a plot to destroy Divergents, Tris and the mysterious Four must find out what makes Divergents dangerous before it's too late.","""Divergent"" is the first Sci-Fi movie of this trilogy and in this movie we watch a world that is divided into factions and each person has to be a part of one. Unfortunately Tris cannot be a part to any of these factions because she is a divergent. Divergents are considered as the most important and dangerous people and have to be eliminated but why?I liked this movie because it has a different kind of plot from other Sci-Fi movies and that's something that made this movie interesting at first. The direction which made by Neil Burger was very good with many good action scenes. Also the interpretation of Shailene Woodley who played as Tris was very good. An equally good interpretation made by Theo James who played as Four.Finally I have to admit that I did not expect much from ""Divergent"" but it was a very nice surprise. This movie made a very good start for this trilogy and I hope to continue like this and even better."
Coco avant Chanel,2009,6.6,The story of Coco Chanel's rise from obscure beginnings to the heights of the fashion world.,"Coco avant Chanel focuses, quite literally, on the roots of Coco before the whole Chanel business.I noted the movie seemed to frustrate those with no grasp of the French language at all. Many seemed to go in unaware that the movie was set before her 'Chanel' days and I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment at the end from others; via looking at their faces, overhearing conversations and talking with friends. It's interesting, but it does plod on very slowly.We are treated to a very rude, harsh character in Coco. Full credit goes to Audrey Tautou for her performance though. She really does fit into this movie's feel and tone very well. Her cheeky performance is definitely a highlight.I don't know what to make of Alessandro Nivola as 'Boy'. The character was and looked rather sleazy. I'm not sure if that was meant or if that was Alessandro. Other than that, mentions go to Beno√Æt Poelvoorde for his solid performance and Emmanuelle Devos as the sexy and self-assured Emilienne d'Alen√ßon.Other than that, it's a solid biopic. 7/10"
La d√©licatesse,2011,6.6,A French woman mourning over the death of her husband three years prior is courted by a Swedish co-worker.,"What I didn't quite get from this is why the recently bereaved ""Nathalie"" (Audrey Tautou) would have moved on from the cute and cuddly ""Fran√ßois"" (Pio Marma√Ø) to the rather stockily structured Swede ""Markus"" (Fran√ßois Damiens). Anyway, when the former man in her life goes for an ill-advised jog, she finds herself widowed, back at work and largely rudderless. Her boss (Bruno Todeschini) has always been keen, but she makes it rather abruptly (and entertainingly) clear that not even on a desert island. Then - well after about three years - she encounters her new Swedish colleague. She doesn't exactly mince her words (or actions) and that leaves him in a semi-pleasant state of confusion. To say she initially blows hot and cold would be an understatement, but as things settle down it might just prove possible that something substantial might happen between them - but first she must come to terms with, and try to deal with a grief that still lingers. Along the way, there are some entertaining swipes at the politics of the office and of friendships where opinions are never far away - wanted or otherwise. The denouement is a little quirky. It's not what I was expecting but did somehow top off this meringue of a film. It's got just enough of a frame to hold it together, but is pretty mushy underneath. Tautou has a charm about her - she reminds me slightly of Audrey Hepburn, and the direction allows her to present her characterisation engagingly as the essence of the film. Even though it's all a little listless at times, I did quite enjoy it."
Indul a bakterh√°z,,8.2,Story of a mischievous outspoken kid in a small Hungarian town.,"Dear Non-Hungarian Readers/Movie Watchers!I am really sad to say, but I think this film was made only for Hungarian people. I respect Non-Hungarians who try to understand this movie, but I'm sure they wont. Even not if they read the book, tried to study the language... I don't want to hurt anybody... The characters use an accent that is funny on its own. Bendeguz is a 'Hungarian farmer' (Paraszt) kid with a very simple but totally positive view of the world - and has conflicts with people who don't have the same emotions. These conflicts and his tactics to avoid them - or cause them - are really fun. But for Foreigners, this film is a nice memorial of the Hungarian farmer-society and its life between the two World Wars, and I guess nothing more."
Feh√©r teny√©r,2006,7.4,"Having suffered as a boy under a brutal Communist-era coach, champion Hungarian gymnast Miklos moves to Canada years later in search of a new start - only to find himself unwittingly perpetuating the very same cycle of abuse among his own pupils.","The traditions in East and West for training gymnasts have been long known but perhaps never more starkly portrayed than in White Palms.Based on autobiographical elements involving his brother (and the film's star), Hungarian director, Szabolcs Hajdu, brings us a tale of a gold medal standard gymnast, initially training at age ten under a regime of brutal corporal punishment, then later adapting with difficulty to very different attitudes in Calgary, Canada.As a boy, Dongo (played by athlete Zolt√°n Mikl√≥s Hajdu), receives little mercy in the hands of his trainer. The boys are asked to line up, but Dongo's feet are a fraction over the drill line, and he is punished with a blow from the side of a sword which leaves a blood-stained bruise on his thigh. When questioned, he tells his parents that he has thrown a knife at the girls, as they think he is lying when he claims his punishment was only for a minor incident. Parenting seems authoritarian and distant, although they don't hesitate to show his athletic skills off to relatives, and Dongo is forced to 'perform.' A background song later intones, ""Summer has flown, far has it gone, over, all over, and I still question why."" For Dongo and his classmates, it must seem that the joys of summer have eternally left their lives; and when he arrives late one day for practice, fearing the chastisements that will surely follow, he runs away.In the Canadian scenes, shortcomings of the Western system are equally challenging. With little in the way of sanctions for unruly students, teachers are stretched to cope with rudeness and laziness. Through a friendship with a younger athlete, Dongo not only learns to look at the world through new eyes, but finds a part of himself that has long been abandoned.White Palms is carefully edited to juxtapose more than one edge-of-the-seat moment. Tension is skilfully built into a story that is part documentary, part drama, and casting real gymnasts adds to the feeling of authenticity. Stark contrasts in the use of colour emphasise isolation - cold bluish tones for the scenes in Hungary are punctuated only with the bright red of the girls' outfits (in a sectioned-off area of the gym). Before going to Canada, Dongo's only venture into the latter world of brightness is when he is humiliatingly punished, providing a spectacle for the girls. The soundtrack has some haunting songs, although I felt the opening music was off-key - possibly intentionally - which I found a bit off-putting.White Palms brings some emotion-laden content to a fairly dry subject, as well as providing useful contrasts between the former Soviet bloc and the modern Western way of thinking. It might not make the mainstream market, but is a very watchable contribution from Eastern European cinema."

I have not seen too many Hungarian movies, unfortunately, but I thought this movie was good in comparison to all movies.All the characters were well defined and although the ""american"" film director did not sound entirely American, to Hungarians, he was very convincing.The whole thing about the soundtrack and the advertisements- I really could care less, considering the genre of the movie. This is not some kind of profound drama that's meant to explore some major psychological issue. It's a hilarious comedy that gives some insight to Hungarian culture and their perception of America.Like the other guy said, it's got some really hot chicks. I really wonder why the movie is not internationally renowned. Maybe everyone's thinking: where's HUNGARY, anyway? It's a shame..."
Taxidermia,2006,6.8,"Story about three generations of men: pervert that constantly seeks for new kinds of satisfaction, an obese speed eater and a passionate embalmer.","Oh my god! I just got out from seeing Taxidermia at MIFF 2006 and I was literally speechless. As I was one of the first to leave the theatre, I took it upon myself to stand out the front and watch the expressions on the faces of other patrons as they exited. Most were laughing in disbelief at what they had just seen, some were white as ghosts and some looked plain baffled. Whatever way you look at it, Taxidermia will certainly make a strong impact on you.I saw Gyorgy Palfi's ""Hukkle"" a few years ago at MIFF and although that was an interesting film, he's really excelled himself with Taxidermia. One thing's for sure, you'll need a strong stomach to watch Taxidermia a) for the gore & b) cause you're gonna laugh your head off! Outstanding cinema! 10/10"
Valami Amerika 2,2008,6.8,"The three brothers, Akos, Tamas and Andras - known from the first part - try to get back their 60 million forints stolen by impostor Alex who ran away with the money and the girlfriend of the oldest brother.","I wonder that I'm the first one who's writing a review on this Title, coz' I have to say this sequel is more fun than the first one. The playground is wider, the sounds are great, no wonder that it accomplished to get an award for it, but the hungarian form of the maffia made me laugh, it was really characteristic from the view of hungarian nation, and original. The theater part of the movie was delightful, I think they mostly took pressure on everything: vision, music, actors, effect, humor, story etc. It's a great experience from getting know about hungarian movie-production, so tally ho, you gotta see this, if you either liked/disliked the first part."

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,2008,6.2,"In 1957, Indiana Jones is called back into action when he becomes entangled in a Soviet plot to uncover the secret behind mysterious artifacts known as the Crystal Skulls.","Many years and the shine has been tarnished, the fascia has cracked like old varnish, though there's still a small spark, that carries some kind of arc, there's enough to enjoy and be cherished."
Macskafog√≥,1986,8.3,An agent delivers plans to save mice from a feline syndicate dedicated to eradicating rodents.,"So this was my favorite cartoon movie for years. In this world the cats are the top predators, but they live side by side with the terrorized mice. When the Internouse have no more chance to stop the robberies of the Mafia like cats, they call their forgotten agent: Grabovski.The speeches are very ironic, and funny. Some could be translated: -Remember what Julius Caesar said? -The guy who smuggled heroine in his wooden leg?? -Sure......I don't want to involve politics, but it was visible that the cats looked like the west: tweeds, smoking Cuban like smoke, champagne etc. The good boy mice: presented the eastern block: uniforms, cigarettes....I can only recommend for all family who want to have a good day.

The Mask of Zorro,1998,6.8,"A young thief seeking revenge for his brother's death is trained by the once-great, aging Zorro, who is pursuing his own vengeance.","Don Diego de la Vega (Anthony Hopkins) is the original Zorro who battled the tyrannical Spanish rule of Governor Montero. On the verge of liberation, Zorro is imprisoned, his wife killed, and his daughter abducted. Twenty years later, Montero returns to take advantage and Zorro escapes with Alejandro Murrieta (Antonio Banderas). Zorro decides to train Alejandro as the new Zorro.This is a good adventure flick. It has fun sword play especially with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Antonio Banderas. They have good chemistry together. And so does Hopkins and Banderas. It keeps the tone light and irreverent. It's an entertaining romp."
L√∫das Matyi,1977,8.2,"A young peasant boy stands up to tyranny, aided by his trusting friend- a goose.","This is one of the most well-known children's story in the Hungarian literature, the original goes back to 1816 by Mih√°ly Fazekas. It's not just a well drawn, cute story of the poor boy who suffers great unjust from the rich lord, and gets big (and funny) revenge, but the whole movie flows on beautifully selected music which really gives a special feel to it. Unfortunately, as almost always happens with animated movies, it's only best when listening to the original voices, so non-Hungarians lose here some of the beauty. (DVD release did a fair job on translating the voices to English.) If you want to break free from the Hollywood-style ""flashy tricks, simple story, pop music"" animations then check this by all means. Recommended."
Zimmer Feri,1998,6.4,A 50 year-old entrepreneur Mr. Fik√°sz rents a small resort at lake Balaton. He tries to make a lot of money for his family but along the way he makes a lot of bad decisions.,"this movie is undoubtedly hilarious. i just cannot believe why critics reviewed it as a failure. I mean, Peter Timar is probably the most creative director in Hungary, his ideas are fantastic, he has a great sense of humor, we could already notice in the movie Csinibaba.Judit Pogany and Gabor Reviczky are great in the leading roles, but its Natalia Nagy and Miklos Galla who steal the show with their unbelievable comedic performance ( no wonder they were once members of the same comedic team, called L art pour L art) . Natalia shines, a wonderful comedienne, playing the ultra/modern, sporty, fashion/fanatic. Mikos Galla is just exceptional in the role of the detective. The other part of the cast also does its job well. I laughed so many times....If somebody wants good fun...please do not miss this movie."
√úvegtigris 2.,2006,6.8,"In the sequel to the surprise hit √úvegtigris (2001), we witness the 6 losers again as they run amok around the roadside buffet, which again fails to make their dreams come true, but which serves as the basis and end station of numerous funny adventures.","√úvegtigris 2, as its title shows is a sequel. As it is a sequel to a successful movie, I had high expectations, as well as fears when I bought my ticket for the movie. In the beginning, as I was sitting in the cinema and the characters came marching in, one by one, without any order I was scared. Csoki arrived with his old motorbike, carrying loads of beer and shouted ""Easy Rider my bro!"" as in the movie before. It seemed it would be nothing more than the first √úvegtigris re-told. But later the actor-director P√©ter Rudolf (Lali in the movie) came up with bright ideas, which went over the standard before: A funeral where the mayor's speech makes everyone laugh, the two stock-policeman characters, who try to run in front of their own speed cameras to exceed the limits themselves as no one is around. Scenes like these make the audience laugh. The most brilliant parts in the movie are the bits which look like music videos a'la Hungarian style. Being a bit like a ""re-make"" of the previous √úvegtigris, the movie fails to come up with a totally satisfactory effect on the audience. There is one thing, however that has a brilliant conception: the sense of being alone depicted. The sense that time has stopped, that nobody cares. With all their swears, all their jokes and easiness, the guys are a bunch of losers after all, stuck in the Hungarian reality. Watch it if you liked the first part, forget it if you did not!"
Argo,2004,7.0,"The crew of Tibi Balogh sets out on a journey across Hungary to get the ancient Gold Owl statue, as well as the Milk Man. The treasure is worth millions, who gets there first?","Actually this movie can be liked by those who understand the director's ""enfant terrible""-way of life. It is a good comedy, anyway, but if you understand all those unsaid comments Arpa implemented, then it's a great movie - unfortunately these things will not be understood by non-Hungarians.You don't need brains to laugh on the jokes but you need brains to understand the jokes between the lines.Many viewers loved it, some just simply liked it and then there are the shallow-minded ones who didn't like it because they don't like the director himself. And yes, Arpa is - just as well as his movie - something special, not made for the dumb crowd and people with prejudice but for film lovers who appreciate courage and personality.Sure, ARGO has mistakes, that's why I am waiting desperately for the next movie. Because whatever this guy did so far, he always knew where he was with himself. That's something not too many people can say about themselves.I understood Arpa's next movie is a romantic Thriller. If that is true: BRING IT ON!"
A miniszter f√©lrel√©p,1997,6.7,A Minister and the Secretary of the Opposition party go to a 5 star hotel to conduct a secret affair. Their plans are ruined when they discover a corpse lodged in the window of their room.,"An easy, but humorous and somewhat intellectual flick. The male leads give a reasonably good performance, and the minister's romantic interest is voluptuous enough to let us ignore her total disability as an actress. This movie is a classic, situation-driven comedy, recommended to any who speaks Hungarian. Don't miss it."
√úvegtigris 3.,2010,6.4,Roadside buffet runner Lali grabs the opportunity to leave everything behind and heads to the big city in a fine sports car with a gorgeous young lady.,"Previously I've checked many reviews on the net, mostly saying this movie doesn't worth a cinema ticket. Well, after watching it, I must agree with the most, and I must say the only nice thing in this movie is the ass of Erika Szab√≥. √úvegtigris 3 has tried to be too popular, thus losing the genuine and identical atmosphere presented in the first part of the trilogy.The characters well known from the previous parts were overacted, the dialogs were rigid. It was all about clumsy idiots, and not about the weird stuff happening with ordinary people. The spice-like bittersweet feeling of the Hungarian casual lifestyle was gone, and the poor loser's disadvantages came to the place. Well you know the difference between funny and pathetic.How could I describe... the whole taste was synthetic and the feel of this ""I-will-be-funny-or-die-trying"" was awful. Despite that I have no regrets about watching it; Erika is _really_ a jewel for the eyes. That' all."

But there's only one way to do it: money. For that, Richie goes back in time to eradicate mammoths and turn them into oil he'll be able to sell later.","I watched this movie in it's original language with subtitles at the Fantasy Film Festival in Stuttgart/Germany and I enjoyed it very much indeed!This animated feature is not for the faint of heart or for people who do care about PC things ... so it's not for children either or Bush sympathizer's! But for lovers of great dark comic humor. There are so many gags hidden here, you might not get them all at your first viewing ... But unfortunately you might not get them the second time around. It's not the movies fault, it will be because you don't get all the nuances of the original (you have to speak Hungarian and maybe even have lived there to get some things ... at least that's what I've heard from other viewers, who must know ... Hungarians of course)"
Kontroll,2003,7.6,"A tale about a strange young man, Bulcs√∫, the fellow inspectors on his team, all without exception likable characters, a rival ticket inspection team and racing along the tracks - and a tale about love.","The Independent Film Channel has been screening the full length version of Kontroll (111 minutes by my reckoning), widescreen, with nice clear subtitles. I watched the first 3 minutes and was hooked, open-mouthed, for the duration of the movie. The stunning ""railing"" sequence, a spine-tingling dolly shot that simply refuses to cut away, is like one of those dreadful nightmares wherein one is being chased by the dark, hooded figure who gets ever closer ... in fact the entire movie is a dream-state, a blossoming of those flowers of evil any city dweller has sensed in a subway late at night, when there are few people around ... it took me back to my days (or nights) working late in the West End of London, and catching the last, late underground train home ... Strange that nobody has commented on the way the movie navigates the low-key sexual tensions between the (almost entirely male) characters, with the leader of the rival ""railing"" gang making a gay-baiting comment about his antagonist ... and thus it is even more interesting that the young woman - Bela's daughter - is reductively described by many reviewers as Bulscu's 'girlfriend' when she doesn't really fulfil that prosaic a dramatic function, any more than the 'pusher/shadow' is a literal serial killer in the manner, say, of Lustig's 'Maniac'. She occupies a similar space to the magnificent owl, a being that sees what is going on in the darkness (and that also is sacred to Athena, goddess of -among other things- wisdom). And while the subtitles refer to her as wearing a ""bear"" suit, viewers on IMDb and amazon seem to think she's in a ""bunny"" suit, while I would swear she's in a kangaroo cozzie. In fact the presence of real or masquerade animals in the movie is mythically interesting - I counted 3 dogs, for instance, and was reminded of the 3-headed dog Cerberus, the Guardian of the Underworld in classical mythology (also a reference Fincher made in 'Se7en') I could write reams about this astounding movie. Dream-like, nail-biting, humane and terrifying in equal measure, it's a work of which all involved in its making must be amazingly proud. And can anyone identify the brilliant young man who plays the dazzlingly choreographed fare-dodger, spraying Tibor's face with ... what ? Crazy Foam ? Shaving cream ? ... and parcouring magnificently down the escalator before meeting his (shocking) fate ?"
A P√°l-utcai fi√∫k,1968,7.8,"In Budapest, two rival gangs of young boys lay claim to a vacant lot. The hostilities escalate yet never quite boil over into actual violence. The film poignantly portrays the struggles and resilience of youth amid the harsh realities of war.","Like many of the other commentators, I saw this (once only!) when roughly the same age as the boys in the movie. 30+ years later I still find myself thinking about it from time to time. The themes of friendship, loyalty and commitment should be equally appealing to an adult viewer.I seem to recall the subtitle ""The War"" appearing on the screen all those years ago. Maybe it is a false memory, driven by the film's notion of ""the good us"" vs ""the evil them"" - which is the undercurrent of the book & movie, and is usually the undercurrent of most actual wars. Even as a kid you could understand the not so subtle message that the movie was delivering.The original 1906 book was written by Hungarian Ferenc Moln√°r during the long spiral of European politics into WWI. The book is still a standard read in many European grade schools. It was also voted the second favourite book in Hungary in 2005.This movie, about Hungarian kids, was filmed in Finland. I wonder if the language might be the reason for this film not being available on DVD in an English version. Quite unfortunate, as this was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film - losing to the Russian 8 hour version of War and Peace (Voyna i Mir)."

The center of the movie is a food shop in a caravan in the middle of nowhere, somewhere in Hungary, and the locals who live their life, do their business there or just hang around to spend the days, and where every day is just the same... but different. Everybody is real and fighting for survival... and they're unreal as much as the world is. (I've just seen ""Clerks"" and the movie reminded me of ""that day"" there, when ""everything just happens"".) This is one of the best Hungarian movies nowadays (doesn't contain politics and doesn't revolve around sex, truly an exception). Watch it."

However, to ensure the certain, Mr. Simon, block-trustee and ever-watching bastion of socialist order and decency steps into action.","This is a movie that wants to display the past communist era in Hungary as one where life was cheery and happy, only a few did encounter the government. This is quite a false opinion, as it does not mention that terror and fear ruled the people's everyday lives. When people did not trust even their closest relatives there could not be such a barbiegirl-like world. Some may suspect that this was quite propagandistic. People who do not know the communist world might think it was good. However, this does not meet the truth."
Freedom Writers,2007,7.6,"Erin Gruwell, a young teacher in a racially divided Los Angeles school, inspires her class of at-risk students, deemed incapable of learning, to learn tolerance, apply themselves, and pursue education beyond high school.","What a wonderful movie - my teenage daughters enjoyed it as much as I did. Not an easy to feat to accomplish! I had seen ""Bobby"" in the afternoon and went home and cried like a baby. Then, a few hours later took my daughters to a screening of Freedom Writers and left feeling so uplifted. The movie made be believe in the power that one person can hold to improve the lives of others. Education and empathy are also powerful tools in eliminating prejudice and intolerance. The movie made me feel that the time I spend volunteering at my children's' schools is so worthwhile, but maybe I could do more! Let's use this holiday season to help others as we help ourselves."
Freelancers,2012,4.7,"The son of a slain NYPD officer joins the force, where he falls in with his father's former partner and a team of rogue cops.","OK, I recognized a few names in this movie: Robert De Niro, Forrest Whittaker, Dana Delaney, and 50 Cent. Based on the aforementioned names, I rented this movie. The bottom line is I got duped. The movie is below-average in every aspect:screenplay, acting,and directing. Basically, the whole film feels generic and half-assed. What is surprising is that the characters are all superficial and one-dimensional. This is to be expected from the likes of 50 Cent and some of the supporting characters, but from Robert De Niro and even Forrest Whittaker, it is incomprehensible.In the past, the name Robert De Niro would have conjured up memories of incredible movies from the 70's and 80's such as Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Godfather 2,Mean Streets, The Deer Hunter, etc. However, Robert De Niro has not made a quality film in almost a decade. What happened? Has wealth and fame completely enervated his passion for acting?Very Disappointing."
Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,2010,6.2,"Now out of prison but still disgraced by his peers, Gordon Gekko works his future son-in-law, an idealistic stock broker, when he sees an opportunity to take down a Wall Street enemy and rebuild his empire.","I was looking forward to seeing what Oliver Stone & the ensemble he got together could do with an updated version of an even greedier Wall Street that was gambling with obscene amounts of money & making their own rules that the S.E.C. didn't do anything about or even try to understand it seems.I was very disappointed. This follow up didn't fare well against the original...which is almost always the case. But with Stone directing again & Douglas in again...I thought this may have a chance. Some part 2's are just laughable...I guess they make money or they would stop doing them. The big exception of course was ""The Godfather part 2"".Anyway - this movie just didn't have the snap, crackle & pop of the original. And I think the movie spent way too much time on the Jake & Winnie relationship played by Shia LaBeouf (wasn't that Glenn Campbell's name in the original ""True Grit"", well....maybe it was LaBeef) & Carey Mulligan. By the way...very sad about Campbell's Alzheimers admission.When I saw this movie I knew that LaBeouf had been in a lot of Hollywood movies & must have been well thought of....but it was the 1st movie I had seen him in. I thought he did OK with the part he was given. But Mulligan was such an annoying character as Winnie....or was it Whiney? Every time she was in a scene it was like fingernails on a blackboard. Did anybody else feel that way about Mulligan's performance?And as others have said...the ending was just not very good."
"Two Days, One Night",2014,7.3,"Li√®ge, Belgium. Sandra is a factory worker who discovers that her workmates have opted for a EUR1,000 bonus in exchange for her dismissal. She has only a weekend to convince her colleagues to give up their bonuses in order to keep her job.","You absolutely will be disappointed if you are looking for a ""robot fighting robot"" movie or anything superficial, or beautiful woman. (Well no one can say Cottilard is not beautiful, but she deliberately gives up her beauty to fit the character.)This movie shows us what real emotions is. It reveals life in such a vivid and convincing way that you'll think about your own life, although you may be a lot better off than the characters.After all this movie is a feast of fine acting, a reason that movies are still called art, and a spirit lifting experience that is going to linger on for a long time after you finish it."
Biblioth√®que Pascal,2010,7.0,"In order to regain custody of her daughter, whom she left in the care of her fortune-telling aunt, Mona must tell a social worker her story. The tale she spins---and the movie we watch---is a wild, surreal adventure in which people are able to project and enter each other's dreams, and our heroine is sold into slavery and lands in a swank, debauched Liverpool brothel ...Read all","I do not have a shadow of a doubt to rate this movie with a 10 out of 10 , and I know I am not the only one who like it a lot. Probably is the best movie of the year 2010. Maybe if you already read the plot you got an idea about the movie but as the expression states:SEEING IS BELIEVING you we'll realize that this is exactly the case; You have to see it ! It is so rare nowadays to see real directors with good ideas , imagination and directors who tells us stories , now when everything is cheap and kitsch most of the Hollywood movies are remakes or you got the impression they got nothing to offer .As I mentioned in the title this movie is marked by a magical realism but is not like Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Isabel Allende or another Latin American writer the magical realism is European or should I locate it to the central and eastern Europe. They are no stereotypes about eastern europeans or politics in this movie , and there is a story , you just have to be patient , actually the movie is about story telling from the moment Mona starts to tell the story of herself and her daughter and later on at the fair and at the end in the furniture store."
Torrente 2: Misi√≥n en Marbella,2001,6.4,"Torrente now lives in Marbella; after losing all his money, he returns to private investigation. One case puts him in the middle of a villain's missile plot to destroy the city and his own uncle's blackmail operation--and he knows nothing.","I've seen Torrente 1. GREAT. Torrente 2 is Great too. It is an outrage that Torrente 2 is not available in the Netherlands. I have just ordered a copy in Spain with English undertitles. Torrente 2 is raunchy, dirty and full of big and small jokes. Santiago Segura is the KING.... Torrente rules and i hope he will makes lots of other Torrente's. The More the better. I liked the part in T2 where he is sitting and peeing in a swimming pool making racist remarks with his white FAT belly. Segura makes Torrente look like a real loser who thinks he is great. Wrong closes, sunglasses and foul language completes this dirty old ba****d.These movies are my favourite in my dvd collection. I'd never knew that Spain had such fantastic humor. My compliments to you...."
The Railway Man,2013,7.1,"A former British Army officer, who was tortured as a prisoner of war at a Japanese labor camp during World War II, discovers that the man responsible for much of his treatment is still alive and sets out to confront him.","This is arguably one of the best WW2 films I have ever seen. There aren't many films that tell the story of the situation outside of Europe and this tells it brilliantly. Collin Firth portrays the emotional struggle of a man plagued by the war extremely well, and I was gripped from start to finish. I've been to Thailand and this was possibly why I was so affected by the film, but I thought it was extremely touching and thought provoking. The story affected me to the point of tears (as no other film has ever done). There is so much depth and beauty to the film and characters and I think it's a shame it hasn't been rated higher."
Two Lovers,2008,7.0,A Brooklyn-set romantic drama about a bachelor torn between the family friend his parents wish he would marry and his beautiful but volatile new neighbor.,"I use the word ""normal"" to mean ""real world normal"", meaning NOT perfect. These people have issues, they don't know necessarily what they're doing with their lives, they are on medication, the film begins with a suicide attempt. And yes, in the real world this is certainly more normal than chasing through an airport to a swelling symphonic soundtrack and declaring a perfectly rehearsed monologue to the person you love, followed by rapturous applause from everyone at the gate. ""Two Lovers"", while lacking in the sort of clich√©s and melodrama that makes theatergoers all starry-eyed, delivers one of the best love stories I've seen on the big screen.Don't be fooled by the title; this is not a steamy tale of infidelity and illicit passion. It's about a person who is faced with a mostly theoretical choice between 2 lovers. We've all been there. Whether you're married, in a new relationship, playing the field or just dreaming ""what if"", in matters of the heart there's the sure thing, and then there's the crazy impulsive route.Jonquin Phoenix plays ""Leonard"", a man whose life recently underwent an upheaval and who simultaneously meets 2 women: ""Sandra"" who is the sure thing (Vinessa Shaw) and ""Michelle"" who is the crazy route (Gwynneth Paltrow). As the relationships slowly develop (very slowly, at a real world pace), we start to see the conflict not in terms of passion & romance but in terms of life choices.Refreshingly, Leonard is a character who knows what he wants from the beginning, so the audience isn't insulted with annoying ""what should I do"" scenes. Rather, Michelle is the one who represents the unknown, speculative bet in Leonard's world. As the story progresses, all of Leonard's actions are consistent with his feelings, and it's just a matter of seeing how things will play out. Again, this is such a great, unusual, non-Hollywood approach to love stories which, if you really analyze your own experiences, is probably much more in line with the way you handle yourself.Despite this stability of the main character, the story remains unpredictable right up to the final minute. No sappy airport chase scenes here, but I guarantee you'll be riveted in the final act. If you want to see a story that you can apply to your own love life, regardless of your situation, check this out for some deep insight."
The Purge: Anarchy,2014,6.4,"Three groups of people intertwine and are left stranded in the streets on Purge Night, trying to survive the chaos and violence that occurs.","Much better could ever expect! Originally saw in the theater I just wasn't reviewing then, happily enjoying this glorious action/thriller with lots of great madness and creepy gestures. James DeManco's Purge films might not be appreciated much but Anarchy, Election Year and his writing for The Negotiator is so damn good! Such a great concept that is perfectly executed in this adaptation."
Zero Dark Thirty,2012,7.4,"A chronicle of the decade-long hunt for al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden after the September 2001 attacks, and his death at the hands of the Navy S.E.A.L.s Team 6 in May 2011.","This (slightly) fictionalized dramatization of the decade-long hunt for Osama Bin Laden is often difficult to watch, for a variety of reasons, but that doesn't mean it isn't any good. It's just not your typically polished, glistening Hollywood rendition, and that takes a bit of getting used to. Flubbed lines are left in the final cut, which serves to humanize the cast. Quiet, unsuspecting character moments are unforgettably interrupted by sudden explosions of violence - effectively mimicking (or so I have to imagine) the bloodrush of a real-world terrorist assault. The methods of torture employed in America's hunt for Al-Qaeda's leader are brazenly featured, as are the mixed spoils of their occasional success. The first act points a firehose of information at the audience, leaving them just as overwhelmed and buried by minutiae as the lead. Jessica Chastain is fiery and confident in that role, essential traits for the complicated character she occupies, but the rest of the supporting cast fades into the wallpaper when she's around. The actual onslaught on Bin-Laden's compound, which eats up the last hour of the film, is the smoothest and most accessible scene by a longshot, remaining factual and vividly lifelike while also ratcheting up the pacing and the tension. As a whole, though, the film is well-acted and effective, but often slow and over-inflated. Though it paints just one side of the story, it refrains from drawing any final conclusions and instead leaves the viewer to deal with the validity of America's motives and methods."
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,2013,7.3,"When both he and a colleague are about to lose their job, Walter takes action by embarking on an adventure more extraordinary than anything he ever imagined.","One really has to wonder what the professional reviewers are really thinking. We looked over the family movie list and barely decided to go to this one based on lackluster reviews. Six out of six of us REALLY liked it and found it deep and entertaining, and easy to watch. By all means, if you are looking to enjoy a movie, go see this one.If you are looking for a connection to the original story, the connection happens during the first 45 minutes and then seems to go in its own direction. Big deal. The movie moves through characters development, plot lines, and geographies smoothly, and does not reveal its final hand until the end."
The Purge,2013,5.8,"A wealthy family is held hostage for harboring the target of a murderous syndicate during the Purge, a 12-hour period in which any and all crime is legal.","The Purge (2013)* 1/2 (out of 4)Annoying, dumb and eventually cruel film dealing with the one day of the year when America allows you to kill anyone who want without being punished. This ""purge"" is supported by a security system seller (Ethan Hawke) and his wife (Lena Headey) but during the 12-hour period they find themselves the target of a gang of murderers. THE PURGE pretty much gave away its story during the theatrical trailer and I thought to myself that we were going to get something fresh or something that has a few interesting ideas but just didn't work. Sadly there are some interesting ideas floating around but the screenplay is simply so bad and so clich√©d that it pretty much kills anything positive. The biggest problem is that the film is never scary, which is just downright disappointing. Another problem is that the film itself doesn't know what to do with its ""free day to kill"" idea. It takes a while for the viewer to warm up to this futuristic world where we can kill but as soon as you accept this ""law"" the screenplay then pulls a quick one and starts to challenge the morals of such a thing. We then get a bunch of political non-sense thrown in just to make us question the whole thing. Why sell a film on an idea and then not know where to get with it? Even more annoying is that this film contains some of the dumbest and most annoying characters in the history of cinema. Yes, the history of cinema. The couple's young son is someone I wanted to be off the screen ASAP. The daughter isn't much better but just wait until the two twists that happen. Both Hawke and Headey give good performances as does the rest of the cast. If you're expecting a horror film then you're going to be disappointed because even though there's quite a bit of violence, for the most part this is nothing more than a rip-off of STRAW DOGS but set in the future with this one ""change."" Sadly, THE PURGE just never works and in the end you're left with a major disappointment and just a cheap excuse to kill."
The Gunman,2015,5.8,"A sniper on a mercenary assassination team kills the minister of mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. His kill shot forces him into hiding. After returning to the Congo years later, he becomes the target of a hit squad himself.","'The Gunman' opens with the BBC footage that civil war has erupted in the Democratic Republic of Congo between rebel militia and governmental forces locked in a bloody civil war for the control of the country's prized natural resources. Enter Jim Terrier (Sean Penn), a NGO worker providing security while an airstrip is being built. In the middle of chaotic Congo, Jim has fallen in love with Annie (Jasmine Trinca), a Doctors Without Borders volunteer. Annie has attracted the heart of not only Jim but also co worker Felix (Javier Bardem). Felix's jealousy is readily apparent and can only spell disaster for Jim and Annie's relationship. Only a few minutes into the film we discover that both Jim and Feliz are living dual lives. Jim is a hired assassin for a multinational mining company, which is set on protecting their interests in the war torn Congo. Felix is the civil liaison for the foreign mining companies and Sean Penn's assassin team. When the Minister of Mining in the Congo nullifies all mining contracts with foreign companies, Jim is activated by his employer who wants the politician assassinated. The team of four assassins is lead by Cox (Mark Rylance) who announces to his sharp shooters that Felix will decide which of the assassins will take the fatal shot and then said assassin will have to flee the continent immediately after. No surprise Felix chooses Jim to take the shot and having accomplished the mission, Jim is forced to leave Africa and Annie without so much as a goodbye. 8 years later Jim has reunited with the African continent as a UNICEF employee drilling wells when suddenly his past assassination comes back to haunt him. For the next hour and a half, Jim must circumvent Europe to track down who has knowledge of his past deeds and understand why he is wanted dead. Without giving any spoilers, the reason 'The Gunman'never gets off the ground is because the film is unable to sustain any intrigue. Jim is a glorified henchman for a multinational corporation, he is hardly the hero that you want to root for. Jim's character is drawn so thin you know very little about him to care enough whether he lives or dies. Additionally his relationship with Annie earns so little screen time before being abruptly halted that you invest almost nothing in the possibilities of Jim and Annie rekindling at some later date. The questions that Jim seeks answer to could have easily been solved with a couple phone calls, but instead his contacts send him on a treasure hunt around Europe. Apparently the information Jim needs is only accessible with a change of location at each turn. Each new venue invites its share of killers and combat. While Jim is on his mission for answers, we catch wind that Interpol, headed by Idris Elba, has Jim on their surveillance. Interpol seems one step ahead of Jim in terms of solving the puzzle, however they are convinced Jim is the linchpin to cracking the case. The final act of the movie is very predictable not to mention familiar and even a bit silly. Sean Penn's physique in the film is impressive and we are constantly reminded how much the actor got in shape for the role considering how much screen time his giant biceps earn. There are hardly any production credits that are distinguishable and worth mentioning here. Ultimately, the film underwhelms and feels like it wants to cash in on the fan base of the retired Bourne franchise."
Close Encounters of the Third Kind,1977,7.6,"An Indiana electric lineman finds his quiet and ordinary daily life turned upside down after a close encounter with a UFO, spurring him to an obsessed cross-country quest for answers as a momentous event approaches.","When I saw this movie for the first time I was barely six or seven years old in former Yugoslavia.It has left a huge impact on my childhood world , I was so consumed and mesmerized. That much I wanted to become an astronaut for a long time afterwards .Now , as a 50 year old I feel pretty much the same. And , I didn't become an astronaut unfortunately.I don't know what more to say . It is as realistic, as magical and feel good movie about benevolent aliens as it could be.I hope one day it will become true , so that we all know there is something beyond this world, but not something bad.For everyone who wants to dive into beauty with depth , I can only recommend it."
The Rover,2014,6.4,"10 years after a global economic collapse, a hardened loner pursues the men who stole his only possession, his car. Along the way, he captures one of the thieves' brother, and the duo form an uneasy bond during the dangerous journey.","This film tells the story of a desperate and lonely man whose car is stolen. He goes to extreme lengths to recover his car, killing many people along the way.""The Rover"" is compared to ""The Road"", which I really enjoyed. ""The Rover"" tries to create the desolation and desperation in ""The Road"", but it doesn't quite work. Where the story is going is not clear in the film, and hence it looks as if Guy Pearce's character is a mad man going on a killing spree because someone has done him a little wrong. The pacing is super slow, and therefore it doesn't captivate my interest. Do the characters really need two minutes to walk from a car to a house? That is really dragging screen time unnecessarily.The only redeeming feature is the performance of Robert Pattison. I thought he was just a pretty face that made it big because of a wildly popular series of films. In here, he gives a memorable as a mentally challenged young man. If only the rest of the film is as good as his performance!"
Thor: The Dark World,2013,6.7,"When the Dark Elves attempt to plunge the universe into darkness, Thor must embark on a perilous and personal journey that will reunite him with doctor Jane Foster.","Reviewers say 'Thor: The Dark World' delivers thrilling action and impressive visuals, with standout performances from Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston. However, the plot is criticized for being generic and rushed, with weak character development, especially for Malekith. Humor feels forced, and the direction, though competent, lacks the impact of the original. Despite its flaws, it remains an enjoyable watch for fans."
Space Jam,1996,6.5,"In a desperate attempt to win a basketball match and earn their freedom, the Looney Tunes seek the aid of retired basketball champion, Michael Jordan.","NOTE: This film was recommended to me by Ryan Clevenger for ""Steve Pulaski Sees It.""Living in Illinois, Space Jam is a film that hits the tender spots of the last two generations; one generation that got to experience Michael Jordan's unfathomable legacy as arguably the greatest basketball player who ever lived, and the other, mine, that reflects on his legacy through highlights and documentaries to keep the memory of such an all-star alive. Jordan's legacy didn't stop at on-court talent, as he was one of the most marketed athletes of his time and helped popularize the NBA, let alone the Chicago Bulls, on a previously unforeseen international level.If we remove the nostalgia factor from Space Jam, which is a very difficult thing to do by the way, then the film serves as Jordan's versatility. After retiring from the NBA at a relatively young age to pursue a career in baseball, Jordan only became more of a fascinating person, in addition to someone with impeccable charisma. Space Jam exists as a response to Jordan's departure from the NBA to the MLB, as the Looney Tune gang of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird, Sylvester the Cat, Porky Pig, and Lola Bunny all call Jordan out of retirement when they challenge a group of intergalactic invaders from ""Moron Mountain"" to a basketball game in exchange for the planet.The Looney Tunes thing this will be an easy win, until the aliens from Moron Mountain, who are relatively puny in size and strength, find a way to steal the talents of star basketball players like Charles Barkley and Larry Johnson and become the ""Monstars"" of the court. Meanwhile, Jordan agrees to play for the Looney Tunes team, but it takes all of the five minutes of practice to show that the team is disproportionately talented towards Jordan. As a result, the team indulges in some aggressive training tactics to beat the Monstars and save the planet.As an amalgamation of live-action and animation, especially in an age where Pixar was coming on the scene and traditional animation was soon to be phased out, Space Jam is bright and vivid. The real-life characters of Michael Jordan, Wayne Knight, who has an amusing role, like he always does, Larry Bird, and even Bill Murray's interactions with the animated characters of Bugs Bunny and the like in a convincing, believable manner. The result is a beautifully colored and nicely executed mix of whimsy.Because both worlds of reality and animation are explored here, Space Jam has the luxury of being a film that can go beyond traditional boundaries of a sports film, and the Looney Tunes are no better characters to incite such zaniness. The animated bunch are quick-witted and ecstatic, and Jordan is clearly doing this for fun and excitement rather than a phoned-in project or another endorsement. Had Space Jam been more of a lackluster cash-in, sports fans and Jordan fans would've seen it from a mile away and dismissed the film immediately. However, because everyone involved recognizes what a zany project this is, they don't try to fight the lunacy, but instead, play along, and that provides us, the audience, with a wickedly entertaining stride into a lively sports film that is so fun you almost, almost miss the clich√©d underdog element.Starring: Michael Jordan, Wayne Knight, Bill Murray, and Larry Bird. Directed by: Joe Pytka."
State of Play,2009,7.1,An investigative journalist probes the murder of a Congressman's mistress.,"About a month before State of Play came into theaters, I read an article in The Washington Post (I live in the D.C. area) about the realism of the news industry as portrayed in the movie. One of the Post reporters served as a consultant on the set and I must say that he seems to have done his job. Almost every aspect, from the constantly chaotic state of the newsroom to the reporter-lingo, feels authentic and true to reality. While there are occasional times when the movie's main character, the reporter Cal McCaffrey, strays from the usual ethical and professional guidelines, there are logical explanations for such instances that are given in the movie. At one point, Russell Crowe even ad-libs a line about the outdated technology he has compared to the state-of-the-art computers given to Della Fry, Rachel McAdams's gossipy blogger: ""I've been here fifteen years, I've got a sixteen year old computer. She's been here fifteen minutes and she's got enough gear to launch a f***ing satellite."" This line was inspired by the feud between print journalists and their online counterparts that, according to the Post reporter, exists in real-life. Because journalism is so crucial to the story of State of Play, every minute detail contributes greatly to the believability of the film as a whole and it is this attention to detail that really elevates State of Play above the average political thriller.The cast, which includes three Oscar winners, though Ben Affleck won for screen writing, could not be more perfect. With his long, shaggy hair, bulging belly and old, trash-littered car, Russell Crowe looks appropriately scruffy and he disappears into his role, becoming one of the most convincing journalists on screen in recent years. It is impossible to imagine anyone else in the role, especially Brad Pitt, who was originally signed on for the part. As his partner on the story, Rachel McAdams delivers, giving her character a very energetic yet idealistic flavor. Della Fry is, at least in the beginning, a rather obnoxious woman but, in large part due to McAdams, she gradually becomes more likable and we learn to accept her for who she is. Helen Mirren is splendid as Cameron, McCaffery and Fry's insistent boss, and every time she appears, the screen comes alive (not that it's dead when she isn't there). Ben Affleck once again proves that he can act when given the right material. He gives his character, a promising congressman, an air of detached arrogance mixed with frustrated vulnerability. Representative Stephen Collins certainly has his principles but throughout the film, that sense of morality is largely shrouded in secrets and mystery and the audience is forced to constantly guess and re-guess his true intentions. Aside from the main actors, the supporting cast does a terrific job with a slightly comedic, almost delightfully over-the-top performance by Jason Bateman as a pretentious PR agent. Also worth noting is Viola Davis, who plays a contact of McCaffrey's in the morgue, and even though she only appears in one scene, she makes the most of that short screen-time that, in turn, makes us remember her well.Other than the superb cast, one of the most impressive things about State of Play is the script, which was written by Tony Gilroy, Billy Ray and Matthew Michael Carnahan and based on the 2003 BBC mini-series of the same name. However, it bears Tony Gilroy's distinctive mark not only because it involves corporate conspiracies and unending twists, but the witty dialogue could have been written by almost no one else. Occasional instances of humor help lighten the otherwise rather dark mood. Also, the writing is highly intelligent and makes the audience actually think rather than simply go along with the complicated plot. This can also be contributed to the direction of Kevin MacDonald who, after winning an Oscar for his documentary One Day in September in 1999 and directing the Oscar-winning feature film The Last King of Scotland, proves that he has loads of talent and hopefully, will remain prominent in the film-making industry.Other noteworthy aspects of the movie are the cinematography and the score, both of which help carry the tension throughout the entire two-and-a-half hour film, even during quieter scenes. However, State of Play is not quite perfect. The main, and perhaps only, flaw is the minor plot holes that, while virtually unnoticeable during the actual viewing of the movie, become more obvious upon dissecting the movie afterwards. It is impossible to discuss these errors in detail without giving anything away, but they do make the conclusion a little less satisfying.Nonetheless, the movie is so good in all other areas that it is still easy to overlook the implausibility of the ending. From the virtually flawless cast and writing to the authenticity of its portrayal of journalists and the thought-provoking political themes, State of Play stands out among all the conventional political thrillers churned out by Hollywood in recent years. Go see it!"
Red Tails,2012,5.9,"A crew of African American pilots in the Tuskegee training program, having faced segregation while kept mostly on the ground during World War II, are called into duty under the guidance of Col. A.J. Bullard.","Red Tails is a movie about the Tuskegee Airmen. A squadron of black Army pilots who served with distinction in Europe in World War II despite facing racial prejudice.The film was produced by George Lucas and it has some top notch CGI with the aerial battle scenes. The script is rather corny and flat as well as being fictionalised.The four main characters are Marty 'Easy' Julian (Nate Parker) who likes to drink a lot. His best friend, Joe 'Lightning' Little (David Oyelowo) a hotshot pilot who is having a romance with a local Italian woman. Samuel 'Joker' George (Elijah Kelley) is good for laughs. Ray 'Junior' Gannon (Tristan Wilds) is the baby of the group.The film is too uninspired, cheesy and cliched. It manages to get glorified cameos from Terrence Howard and Cuba Gooding Jr."
Leap Year,2010,6.4,"Anna Brady plans to travel to Dublin, Ireland to propose to her boyfriend Jeremy on February 29, leap day, because, according to Irish tradition, a man who receives a marriage proposal on a leap day must accept it.","Get over the negative reviews. This is a lovely film, sweet, with charming characters and a lovely setting. If you believe in the power of romance it may even make tears well up in your eyes. Not meant to change the world just meant to be a fun film. Louis, as in Louis Vuitton the suitcase, is one of the best characters right to the end of the film!"
A tan√∫,1969,8.6,A poor Hungarian dyke-keeper is caught in the politics of illegally slaughtering his pig by a corrupt and deceitful system of government.,"This movie did what the other Hungarians couldn't: Really enjoyable and makes the Hungarian '50-s era understandable even for foreigners who have never lived under communist regime. No need to say more.Well, OK. Just because of the commenting rules.This movie is full of unforgettable characters. Comrade Vir√°g and the old logopedist lady are my favorites. This aspect is one of the many strong points of the Tan√∫. And so on, the play of the actors, the sentences and termini technici which became part of the national culture, the great atmosphere, the unique sense of humor made this movie a masterpiece. After more then 20 times of watching, it still can't become boring."
Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason,2004,6.0,"After finding love, Bridget Jones questions if she really has everything she'd ever dreamed of having.","The problem with a sequel is that expectations are high - particularly after a film as successful and engaging as BJ1. I knew already that the new film did not adhere to the second book so I didn't expect to be making comparisons. However, this movie was frankly ridiculous.My problem with the film in main was that the character of Bridget was over-parodied. She is not supposed to be so much fatter than everyone around her, or as scatty and ungainly as she is portrayed in the film, which makes it harder to believe that there are 2 men and a woman after her.The first film's success was due to the protagonist being charming and endearing - she made ""human"" mistakes (for example, the ""blue soup"") and fell for an unsuitable man who cheated on her. We felt sorry for her but also felt that she was funny and kooky and wanted her to ""get her man"" in the end. In this new movie she is frankly annoying, and we are almost incredulous that Mark Darcy should want her at all. They have nothing in common, the reason they break up at the beginning is not believable in any way, and the reasons they reunite are just as difficult to comprehend.I also felt that the characterisations were not as layered as in the first movie, and the stupid lesbian twist didn't seem to make any sense.It is a shame that they were so close yet so far with this new film, because in a way it negates the success and hilarity of the first one, which was a classic, intelligent portrayal of a 30-something singleton looking for her man. BJ2 is just a badly-made slapstick about a fat, unattractive girl who looks a complete mess and doesn't seem to have any self-awareness whatsoever. Sorry to be so harsh, but with the weight of the various names attached to the film, expectations were high......."
Escape Plan,2013,6.7,"When a structural-security authority finds himself set up and incarcerated in the world's most secret and secure prison, he has to use his skills to escape with help from the inside.","This is a simple plot movie that symbolizes everything about Silvestre and Schwarzenegger glory days. There is no thick plot or real complexities, it's a simple bad guys Vs good guys action flick. However, the movie does not disappoint, its very entertaining and full of action and hard core scenes. The acting is as expected, nothing Oscar worthy but good enough from action legends like them. The idea is simple and is easily understood. The one difference in this movie is that the chemistry between Schwarzenegger and Stallone is excellent and they deliver some humor also. The only downside that I can think about is the fact that this movie is really meant for both the stars fans and not people who are looking for real ideas or excellent cinematography. Bottom line go enjoy the movie and don't forget your popcorn."
Entrapment,1999,6.3,"Insurance investigator Virginia Baker deems that the thief Robert MacDougal has robbed a Rembrandt painting. To retrieve the painting, she poses as an art thief, cooperating with him in criminal acts.","I have this film two chances and liked it much better the second time. I guess I expected more on the first viewing, but why not? Sean Connery usually is good, Catherine Zeta-Jones was a hot, new commodity at the time, and I usually enjoy heist films.This movie had not just one but TWO heists in it, so it should have been really good.....but was fair, at best.It just wasn't that entertaining, too flat in too many spots. Connery looked at times like he was just going through the motions. His usual spark was missing. It's not bad....so-so as a thriller goes, but really not memorable and certainly not as dramatic as it should have been."
The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,2000,3.7,"In this live-action prequel to The Flintstones (1994), the Flintstones and the Rubbles go on a trip to Rock Vegas, where Wilma Slaghoople is pursued by playboy Chip Rockefeller.","I was surprised by this movie.I hated the original, I suppose because none of the cast of the original (except Elizabeth Perkins) resembled the Cartoon cast.I'll probably get stoned alive for saying this, but I didn't like John Goodman's Fred Flintstone. I think he played him awkwardly as though, he didn't really want to be in the movie.But Mark Addy was a lot lot better. OK, he didn't have the voice down to a tee, but he resembles Fred, when made up, a whole lot more than Mr. Goodman.I just wish they would have asked Elizabeth Perkins to re-create her role as Wilma. She did a great job in the original, and resembled and sounded like the cartoon character, where Kristen Johnston, didn't quite do it for me in the role. She looked far too mature to be playing Wilma, and didn't have the voice either.But full marks to Stephen Baldwin and Jane Krakowski as Barney and Betty. They were also a lot better than Rick Moranis and Rosie O'Donnell from the original film. Mostly because, again, they sounded like the cartoon characters and Krakowski resembled Betty. (Baldwin in no way looked like Barney though - oh, well, can't be perfect, but he makes up for it with the voice and laugh).Joan Collins is also hilarious in the film, as the Filthy Rich Mother of Wilma, and again, does a better job that Elizabeth Taylor from the original.Also watch out for Alan Cumming. He almost steals the film with his ""Mike Jagged"" from the Stones, while also playing an alien in a dual role.With great creatures (Jim Henson workshop), good gadgets and an all-round enjoyable film, I give this an 8 out of 10."
The Recruit,2003,6.6,A brilliant young CIA trainee is asked by his mentor to help find a mole in the Agency.,"Ironic this movie's made by Spyglass? Or is it? Isn't there ambiguity there as well?Nothing is what it seems.Yes the writers could have gone over their screenplay and given it another one-two and that may have raised the caliber another notch, but this is still good entertainment. It won't change your life, but it will be a well spent couple of hours.And it's true the movie could in theory have had a more sophisticated (ambiguous) ending, but there comes a time, after wading through all the trollop on the market, that one just sinks back and decides to enjoy a better movie for all it's worth.And this is such a movie: directed by the capable Roger Donaldson who directed the taut thriller No Way Out and co-authored by a writer on The Natural, this one keeps going at a brisk pace with excellent editing and super soundtrack from Klaus Badelt of POTC1 fame. Farrell - who actually comes off smaller than life what with all the tripe written about him, and that's not a bad thing - and former fashion model Moynahan make the sparks fly. You feel for the protagonists and that's an essential ingredient of any good movie.But Pacino: he's great at whatever he does but is he fated to have secondary roles now? Bah.There's a bit of a 'Spy Game' feel to things but there's no shameless copying going on. There just aren't many movies in this genre. And Spy Game doesn't have the thrill and suspense this one has. Yes, you might eventually figure everything out before the denouement, but you won't be upset. And odds are you won't figure everything out anyway - some yes; all of it - no.As for that ending: some people would perhaps prefer more ambiguity. On several planes. Others would say the ending is ambiguous enough. At least on one plane, perhaps several.Nothing is what it seems."
Larry Crowne,2011,6.1,"After losing his job, a middle-aged man reinvents himself by going back to college.","This movie was lighthearted and just what I needed to brighten my evening! There was no raunchiness which was very refreshing. Tom Hanks was is usual wonderful self. Julia Roberts' character could have been developed a bit better but overall this movie was hysterical and my grandkids loved it also. Of course, it was a bit far fetched in some parts but then you have a comedy, that's the way you make people laugh!! My daughter let me borrow it for the evening and I wish she had given it to me. I may buy it. Yes, I liked it that well. And even though a comedy, it was very relevant to today's problems facing our nation."
The Chronicles of Riddick,2004,6.6,"The wanted criminal Richard Bruno Riddick arrives on a planet called Helion Prime and finds himself up against an invading empire called the Necromongers, an army that plans to convert or kill all humans in the universe.",It was very refreshing to watch a science fiction movie with a great story and fantastic acting. I enjoyed Vin Diesel's performance as Riddick. He made the movie with his one-liners. Casting was very good. Special effects were incredible. I would give it 9 out of 10 stars. I hope there is a sequel to follow this movie. There appeared to be a time span between Pitch Black and Chronicles of Riddick but they bridged the gap quite well. A prequel to Pitch Black would help to establish who Riddick is and where he came from. This movie definitely took me to a place few science fiction movies do now days. I predict that Riddick will be entertaining us with more movies in the future.
Stuart Little,1999,6.0,"When the Littles adopt Stuart, the mouse, George is initially unwelcoming to his new brother, the family cat, Snowbell, is even less enthusiastic. Stuart resolves to face these difficulties with as much pluck and courage as he can muster.","This movie is really sweet, and I enjoyed it enormously. Sometimes it is a bit overly sentimental, and the human characters aren't as charming as the animal characters. Jonathan Lipnicki was sweet as George, but doesn't quite have the charm he brought to the The Little Vampire. Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie do amiably as the parents, but both seem subdued. Luckily, the human characters don't interfere too much with the animals, and still bring a certain charm to the screen. Stuart is wonderfully voiced by Michael J.Fox, and he joined by a hilarious Nathan Lane as Snowbell and a villainous Chazz Palminteri as Smoky. The script is intelligent and sweet, and there are plenty of charming scenes with Stuart and George. All in all, really sweet, fun and memorable. 8/10 Bethany Cox."
88 Minutes,2007,5.9,"On the day that a serial killer that he helped put away is supposed to be executed, a noted forensic psychologist and college professor receives a call informing him that he has 88 minutes left to live.","This movie uses time to create some urgency and a fairly fast pace to keep interest. These devices are used effectively so that combined with Al Pacino and a decent script we have an interesting thriller.The story is a bit extreme, but the pace really did help me not to question that (too much) in the final analysis. The character played by Al Pacino is unsympathetic even though he harbors a terrible past that haunts him. That changes as everything falls apart around him in just over an hour. His struggle to find a killer that he believes will kill him, as well as others, overshadows his obnoxious ego. Has he met his match? Does he have some moral issues that either way are going to be his downfall? It makes for a pretty interesting plot.This isn't the best psychological thriller...but, it's respectable enough to warrant a solid 6 and that is due to Al Pacino largely."
Wild Wild West,1999,4.9,"The two best special agents in the Wild West must save President Grant from the clutches of a diabolical, wheelchair-bound, steampunk-savvy, Confederate scientist bent on revenge for losing the Civil War.","So much potential and ALL of it wasted!We have:1)  A good director, Barry Sonnenfeld, with two great comedies to his name (""The Addams Family"" and ""Addams Family Values"");2)  An Oscar-winning actor, Kevin Kline, well-known for his comedic work (""A Fish Called Wanda"", ""Soapdish"") as well as dramatic (""Sophie's Choice"", ""The Ice Storm"");3)  Another Oscar nominee, Kenneth Branagh (""Hamlet"", ""Henry V""), famous for directing, as well as writing and actingAND THIS IS THE BEST THEY COULD DO !?!?!?! What gives?First and foremost, it should be noted that just because Will Smith is popular, that doesn't mean he's good.  There's something about him when he acts that makes him appear as more of a ""ham"" than an actor, a scene-stealer who's insecure with being the star of a film so he overacts to conceal (albeit unsuccessfully) the limitations of his acting abilities.And for Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh to play second fiddle to HIM?  Absolutely criminal.  What's next?  Jack Nicholson playing a supporting role to Pauly Shore?Then there's the storyline - are we really supposed to believe that James West (as played by Smith, a black man) is a hero of the Civil War?  Of course, the casting of Smith serves primarily as a set-up for all the racial humor (which gets old fast).  Logically, though, it's an asinine premise, a fact which audiences obviously picked up on given the tepid reaction to Smith's so-called ""star power"" in this weak take-off on a really good television series.Who's responsible for this mess? Maybe it's the fault of all the writers (a total of 6) for writing it, or Sonnenfeld's mess for directing it, or Jon Peters' (and Sonnenfeld's) mess for producing it, or Warner Bros.' mess for distributing it?  Whose ever it is, it should just be shelved and forgotten as an embarrassing mistake."
Bedtime Stories,2008,6.0,A hotel handyman's life changes when the lavish bedtime stories he tells his niece and nephew start to magically come true.,"In 1974, Marty Bronson (Jonathan Pryce) builds the Sunny Vista Motel in Los Angeles, California, with the intention of raising his son Skeeter and his daughter Wendy in the place where he works. However he is not a good businessman and the hotel goes bankruptcy. Marty is forced to sell his motel to Barry Nottingham (Richard Griffiths) that promises to hire Skeeter in a general manager position when he grown up. Years later, Barry builds a new hotel; forgets his promise to Marty; and Skeeter Bronson (Adam Sandler) is only the handyman of his hotel. The general manager is the arrogant Kendall (Guy Pearce), who is engaged with the shallow Barry's daughter Violet Nottingham (Teresa Palmer).When the Webster Elementary School where Wendy (Courteney Cox) is the principal will be closed to be demolished, she needs to travel to Arizona for a job interview. Wendy asks her friend Jill (Keri Russell), who is teacher in the same school, to watch her son Patrick and her daughter Bobbi during the day and Skeeter to watch them during the night. Skeeter meets the estranged kids with his best friend Mickey (Russell Brand) and makes up bedtime stories to help them to sleep but the kids add details to the stories, changing their endings. Soon Skeeter realizes that the plot of the stories are coming true and affecting his life. Meanwhile Barry Nottingham decides to give a change to Skeeter to dispute the manager position in his new hotel with Kendall like in one of his stories. But Skeeter has told to his nephew and his niece that stories do not have happy endings.""Bedtime Stories"" is a family entertainment from the Disney Studios surprisingly good. Adam Sandler is very funny in this fantasy and it is impressive how this actor that is not handsome and actually has a sort of stupid face shines with his charisma. I have seen most of his movies and enjoyed most of them.Based on the Metascore (33/100), I dare to say that fortunately I am not a professional critic. ""Bedtime Stories"" is not a movie to win awards in any film festival but is a delightful fantasy to be appreciated by those that have the concept of family and dreams. It might be very sad to have the absence of these feelings in the heart and give such low rating to this beautiful fantasy. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Um Faz de Conta que Acontece"" (""A Make Beliefe that Happens"")"
After Earth,2013,4.8,"A crash landing leaves Kitai Raige and his father Cypher stranded on Earth, a millennium after events forced humanity's escape. With Cypher injured, Kitai must embark on a perilous journey to signal for help.","What is going on with M. Night Shyamalan lately? I used to like him in earlier films like Unbreakable and Signs, but he hasn't made the critics and audiences gifted as it would probably if his directing career is in serious jeopardy. One of the biggest and toughest question is that simple: Why is M. Night Shyamalan directing in a new post-apocalyptic adventure starring Will and Jaden Smith? Did he ever asked to direct After Earth or did Sony wanted to choose any director that Smith had previously worked for instead of Shyamalan? For those who don't know, this is the first lowest-rated movie for Will Smith since 1999's disappointing mess ""Wild Wild West,"" one for Jaden since ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" and another bomb for Shyamalan.After Earth feels like a re-cut of ""Battlefield Earth"" (Ya know, the Travolta movie we don't even care anymore) and sometimes half-""I Am Legend"" and half-""Hunger Games."" But to me, maybe it's the whole Scientology thing that starts to ruin the whole story.The story is ridiculous, poorly acted (Smith sounded like James Earl Jones), mediocre sci-fi elements. How can this movie be much worse? I wished the late Roger Ebert was here giving a harsh review on ""After Earth."" Bottom Line: It's not going to be a big summer success, but it's another letdown for fans of Will Smith. I'll just pass on the movie instead of renting it on DVD.** 1/2 out of 5 stars"
Torrente 4: Lethal Crisis,2011,5.4,"The rude, lewd and crude Spanish ex-police officer Torrente finds himself facing jail time. Can he survive a twisted irony that places him where he has put so many others, both guilty and innocent?","This is the fourth movie about Spanish private detective Torrente. The main character Jos√© Lu√≠s Torrente played by Santiago Segura is an absolute anti-hero. He always has a bad luck and gets in to really difficult situations. On top of that he always looks dirty and does disgusting things and has no manners at all. The whole movie is full of dirty jokes, naked breasts, farts and sneezing. Most of the movie cast are Spanish comedians, actors,famous people and even football players or Real Madrid.If you like this type of humour and you know a bit Spanish culture, you have to see it. I laughed out loud in a lot of moments but there were some jokes related to Spanish media or celebrities that I had to ask my friends for explanation.In my opinion Torrente 4 and Torrente 2 are the best of all Torrente movies."
Seven Pounds,2008,7.6,A man with a fateful secret embarks on an extraordinary journey of redemption by forever changing the lives of seven strangers.,"This is the first time I have ever posted. I saw this movie and it made me want to post. IT seems Seven Pounds is getting a lot of negative press and I felt like I need to do my part to let some people know that this movie is SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL! For me, this was a rare movie that stays with you. I found everything about this movie beautiful..the acting, the music, the directing and especially the beautiful story. A story of giving..sacrifice with purpose. I am not the biggest Will Smith fan, but I must say that his performance for me was ASTOUNDING. I felt his pain and was moved by what his character was doing. This is not a easy story to tell in 2hrs and I think they did a really fantastic job. This movie will not be for everyone...it moves slowly and may be confusing..until you figure it out...then the reality of his purpose will crush you emotionally and at the same time it is so beautiful....SWEET PAIN (it did for me anyway)....Seven Pounds is a wonderful movie that will stay with you long into the night and next day.....Thanks"
Bachelorette,2012,5.3,Three friends are asked to be bridesmaids at a wedding of a woman they used to ridicule back in high school.,"A dark comedy starring three women. That's all the basic information you need to know this was not going to bide well with film snobs, much less the misogynistic ones. Bachelorette is a very humorous and fun movie that I had a great time with. I knew as soon as I got through watching it to come rate it on IMDb though that people would be bashing it, but I had no idea the backlash would be this harsh.The story is simple enough: Four high school friends all get together to relive their glory days as one, the most unattractive (Rebel Wilson), is about to get married. The bridesmaids consist of high-strung Kirsten Dunst, burnout Lizzy Caplan, and dim-witted but lovable Isla Fisher, which in my opinion Isla Fisher absolutely stole the show. I loved it. It is very mean and in your face with it's brutality. You almost wonder why these women are even friends to begin with, but unlike everyone saying there is no reason, the film ties up all it's loose ends and shows how all of the women have their own battle scars and shining personalities in the end.Don't let the comments and rating shy you away from this one, there are some gut-busting scenes. Like I said, Isla Fisher was magnificent. I thoroughly enjoyed and believed in her character, not to say the other stars didn't deliver, she just outshines them!"
Coraline,2009,7.8,"Wandering her rambling old house in her boring new town, a young girl discovers a hidden door to a strangely idealized version of her life that seems too good to be true.","""Coraline"" is simply one of the best animated films ever made: The plots is brilliantly developed, the animation is detailed and beautiful to look at, the characters are fascinating and interesting, and the world created by Neil Gaiman and Henry Selick it's simply captivating, but mysterious and dangerous and well.Clearly influenced by ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Coraline"" is charming and macabre at the same time: At first ""The Other World"" seems like a dream come true, but there is also a constant sense of danger in the air.Dakota Fanning makes a great work as the main character, and Teri Hatcher is flawless in her role of the Mother (And the Other Mother as well) of Coraline, not to mention the excellent performance of Keith David as the cat.""Coraline"" is one of the best movies of the recent years, and it is the best movie of Henry Selick as director since ""The Nightmare before Christmas."""
Torrente,1998,6.8,"Jos√© Luis Torrente, a former policeman fights against the oriental mafia in Madrid.","This was movie of the year in Spain in 1998 following Ulloas success with Airbag the year before. It's about a truly revolting cop in Madrid. He's a sexist,egotistical,dirty pig. There are some memorable scenes in the film and it's quite funny if you don't have any problems with political correctness. It's probably more fun to a Spanish audience who get the jokes about Atl√©tico Madrid fans, ""in"" expressions and other national references. A Spanish viewer can also appreciate all the cameos.  Some of Spain's most renowned actors appear in little parts and add an extra twist to it all. The pace of the movie is fast and there are no dull moments. Go and see it if you can but have a couple of beers before you go."
Prometheus,2012,7.0,"Following clues to the origin of mankind, a team finds a structure on a distant moon, but they soon realize they are not alone.","Don't get me wrong. It's gorgeous to look at, and I'm definitely going to go and see it again. It's really impressive.But... It's stuffed with scenes without any payoff. Again and again it sets stuff up and then just... walks away from it.In at least one unforgivably stupid scene, someone *literally* just walks away from an antagonist and leaves it there. And then doesn't tell anyone about it. Some of it's really effective. There are some scenes that are absolutely gripping. But so much of it doesn't make any sense...Having said all that I think it's very clear that what I just saw was Prometheus part 1. It's very definitely supposed to have a sequel and I will certainly go to see the sequel. I think both movies taken together might score a 10.But this movie by itself doesn't."
"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?",1969,7.8,The lives of a disparate group of contestants intertwine in a grueling and inhumane dance marathon.,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Set in the 1930s, it revoleved around a group of people entering/running a depression dance marathon. The group entering the contest(The principle characters being Fonda, Sarrazin, York, Buttons, Bedilia, Fields)Can't pass up the seven meals a day, or the top prize of 1500 dollars, no matter how grueling the dance will be. Fonda, is a drifter looking for money, Sarrazin wanders into the contest by accident, York and Fields are an actor and actress hoping to be ""Discovered"", and Buttons is also looking for money. The management of the contest is represented by Young, Lewis, and (To a lesser extent)Conrad. While this is not a ""Pick me up"" movie, it is definitely worth seeing. The cast is excellent, and the movie moves along well. Director Sydney Pollack filmed the movie in sequence, which helps to show the fatigue that the characters are feeling. They Shoot horses was nominated for nine academy awards, inglinging Best actress(Fonda), Best Supporting Actress(York) and Best Director(Pollack).However, only Gig Young walked away with the statuette(For best Supporting Actor) and he deserved every inch of it. Playing against typecasting, he knew he was getting the role of a lifetime and he gives one of the best performance of his career. I actually liked Rocky, with his White Tux and his ""Yowza!Yowza!Yowza!"" I don't know if I would have liked the character if Gig Young had not been in the role.Overall, this movie is definitely worth seeing. If you have a chance, give it a look.10/10 ***** out of *****"
Kick-Ass 2,2013,6.5,"Following Kick-Ass' heroics, other citizens are inspired to become masked crusaders, but Red Mist leads his own group of evil super-villains to get revenge, kill Kick-Ass, and destroy everything he stands for.","Violence,Vulgarity,Humor and Suuperheroes.... What's there not to like? So we have Kick Ass(Aaron) and Hit Girl(Moretz) who had marked the presence of superheroes and started the revolution! Christopher Mintz- Plasse reprises his role and come back as a new super villain and now consolidating a team to take revenge. Hit girl tries to balance her life as a student which is a very realstick approach and I liked it a lot! There is a team of superheroes led by Colonel Stars and Stripes played by Jim Carrey who totally pulled it off! The movie had emotional scenes and intense elements just like previous part! If u liked Kick ass 1 , you will definitely love this fantabulous sequel! Truly , it is a stupendous sequel of a meritorious movie!"
Blue Is the Warmest Colour,2013,7.7,"Ad√®le's life is changed when she meets Emma, a young woman with blue hair, who will allow her to discover desire and to assert herself as a woman and as an adult. In front of others, Ad√®le grows, seeks herself, loses herself, and ultimately finds herself through love and loss.","This is a good movie. I liked very much the way in which it describes the birth, maturity and end of a love interest among two young and attractive humans. The scenes in the park and the interplay of sentiments and nuances between the two lovers are very emotional and engaging. The difference of characters is very well presented.The other good point is the sometimes humoristic way in which the down to earth and pragmatic family and social environment of Adele is juxtaposed with the artistic, intellectual and avant guard family and friends of Emma. I think this is the best part of the movie when one compares the realism of Adele with the artistic license of Emma. The scenes where both eat with each others family and the ensuing dialogues are a treat.And now what you are all waiting for: the sex scenes. They are long, hot and explicit. I can not pronounce with conviction whether they served the artistic purposes of the movie or not. If someone wanted to watch the full bloom of a lesbian love story, the scenes may be considered indispensable, if you just wanted to watch a human love story between two people that happen also to have the same sex without caring for so much carnal detail, the scenes could be shorter and more circumspect. The point nevertheless is that those scenes caused a sensation and created a furore and debate from which the movie profited in terms of advertisement. People may now blame or praise it for the wrong reasons.Both actresses where very good in playing their roles. The portrayal by Exarchopoulos of Adele as a teacher in a kinder-garden reading to the children didactic stories with animals or of her abilities as a cook and her insistence that Emma should eat something while Emma is consumed by a telephone call in which she raves about her artistic personality, integrity and vision ignoring Adele and the immediate environment are superb. She is also an actress which made feel empathy for her character. Seydoux is also very credible as the pretentious modernistic and ultimately self-centered Emma. And to conclude with a personal view I liked Adele much more than Emma as a person..."
Elysium,2013,6.6,"In the year 2154, the very wealthy live on a man-made space station while the rest of the population resides on a ruined Earth. A man takes on a mission that could bring equality to the polarized worlds.",What was up with Jodie Foster's horrible overdubbing? It's like watching a spaghetti western when she speaks!Damon plays the flawed character wonderfully and Copley nails it as the evil agent.
A Good Year,2006,6.9,"A British investment broker inherits his uncle's chateau and vineyard in Provence, where he spent much of his childhood. He discovers a new laid-back lifestyle as he tries to renovate the estate to be sold.","I have to admit this 2006 movie based on the book by Peter Mayle (whose ""A Year in Provence"" is a favorite of mine) starts rather unpromisingly since it carries the same smug, self-satisfied attitude that its hero has. Director Ridley Scott takes a while to find the right rhythm for this romantic comedy, but he eventually does, even if it means recycling elements from other similarly executed fish-out-of-water films like ""Baby Boom"", ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Under the Tuscan Sun"". In fact, the whole venture feels decidedly old-fashioned with formula elements feeling like they come from some Universal film made in the 1960's, but the retro-chic aspect somehow works like a fictionalized account of a lifestyle cable channel program since there is little in the way of real dramatic conflict.Atypically cast in a lighter vein here, the naturally pugnacious Russell Crowe seems to be channeling one of the Grants (Cary or Hugh, take your pick) in portraying a Machiavellian-level London investment banker named Max Skinner, who unexpectedly inherits a dilapidated ch√¢teau and vineyard in Provence from his uncle Henry, a figure he loved as a child but has since become estranged due to Max's selfish, greed-obsessed existence. Written by Marc Klein, the bulk of the movie is about what Max does with the estate as he argues with the longtime vintner and becomes entwined with two women - pretty Christie, who claims to be Henry's illegitimate daughter from a tryst with an American, and the too-perfectly-named Fanny Chanel, a beautiful local restaurateur who tries mightily to resist Max's romantic overtures after a most bumpy start. As Max weighs his options, his unforgiving career and jet-setting lifestyle back in London appear to be in jeopardy.More like a Cagney than a Grant, Crowe has the type of aggressive screen persona that takes on all comers, so he seems more in his element being a jerk. However, he acquits himself more than you would expect as the story begins to humanize his character, and he is more deft as a comic actor than even Scott presumes. For example, there are extended sequences in an empty swimming pool and during a tennis match when Scott seems to mistake action for slapstick. Max may be Crowe's most likable role since the loving gay son he played in the 1994 Australian indie, ""The Sum of Us"". In flashbacks, Freddie Highmore, Johnny Depp's prot√©g√© in ""Finding Neverland"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", affectingly plays Max as a child, even though the lack of physical resemblance is a bit jarring. Better is Albert Finney as rhapsodizing Uncle Henry since his casting hearkens back to the actor's youth in south-of-France-set movies like ""Two for the Road"" and ""The Picasso Summer"" in the late sixties.Australian actress Abbie Cornish convincingly portrays a guileless American with more than a passing interest in wine, while Marion Cotillard is a stunning, feisty presence as Fanny (although the obvious age disparity between her and Crowe makes some of the back story a bit of a head scratch). Entertaining though more standard rom-com contributions are made by Tom Hollander as Max's realtor best friend Charlie (in an update of the usual Gig Young third-wheel role), Didier Bourdon and Isabelle Candelier as caretaker Duflot and his playful wife, and Archie Panjabi as Max's jaded but devoted assistant Gemma. The wine-growing region of Provence hardly needs more exposure in movies, but Philippe Le Sourd's cinematography brings it glowingly to life. A most idiosyncratic soundtrack accompanies the film with genre-irrelevant chestnuts like Patti Page's ""Old Cape Cod"", Harry Nilsson's ""Gotta Get Up"" and a French cover of ""Yellow Polka-Dot Bikini"" by Richard Anthony. This is the kind of movie where you can see the ending a mile away, but I have to say for the most part, I enjoyed the ride."
Closer,2004,7.1,The relationships of two couples become complicated and deceitful when the man from one couple meets the woman of the other.,"What an amazing concept. A story that perfectly captures the emotions that we feel when involved in a love spat. The complete desire and need for another person, wanting to hold them close to you, while at the same point in time the mere vision of seeing that person and hearing their voice sends you into utter misery and you feel repulsed by them. Jude Law is masterful in his role, and he is matched equally by the performances of Clive Owen, Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts. A brilliant movie with many mixed emotions. As soon as you think, okay, this is where they live happily ever after, another twisting tale occurs. This is as real as it gets folks. Definitely one worth purchasing when it hits DVD, apart from that, watch it on big screen and you will be amazed at how you relate to this master piece."
America's Sweethearts,2001,5.7,A publicist tries to cover up a feud between movie stars.,"I had bought the DVD of this movie some years ago for $3, probably as a used disc when Blockbuster was closing their rental stores. But I had not gotten around to watching it, until last night. It has a number of fine actors and as a comedy and parody of the movie-making business it is suitably entertaining.John Cusack as Eddie Thomas and Catherine Zeta-Jones
Gwen Harrison are the power couple, generally referred to as ""America's Sweethearts."" The movie begins with a series of short clips from some of their popular movies where their characters are also lovers.Their latest movie is set for release soon but there is a problem. Eddie and Gwen have split up. While still married she has gone off to live with a hot Latin lover. Eddie has not been able to get over the loss. Now the publicist and fixer (Billy Crystal) has to convince both of them to attend the press junket for the movie's release.The other key role is Julia Roberts as Gwen's sister, Kiki Harrison. It seems Kiki has sacrificed her whole existence to help, and cater to, her famous sister who is very demanding and treats Kiki as a servant. That has to come to an end and it does in a most satisfying way.As he does in most of his roles Christopher Walken is the scene stealer as a temperamental filmmaker. His role is rather short but in total might be the most important one, as the final catalyst for change.My wife and I enjoyed it at home on DVD."
I Love Trouble,1994,5.4,Peter Brackett and Sabrina Peterson are two competing Chicago newspaper reporters who join forces to unravel the mystery behind a train derailment.,"When a train crash happens, veteran newspaperman Peter Brackett is sent from the Tribune to cover the story despite him being a columnist.  At the scene of the crash he meets the beautiful young reporter Sabrina Peterson who he tries to hit on without much success, before dismissing her as an inexperienced youth.  The next morning she scoops him in the Globe, getting an angle on the story that he didn't have.  This sparks a rivalry between the two journalists but, as they find out more about the story they find themselves in mortal danger and are forced to form an uneasy partnership.In case you are film-illiterate, this film has even called a character `Thin Man' to help you realise what it is clearly aspiring to be.  The fast talking, battling characters aspire to be like those in the Thin Man series. However the main problem here is that this film has none of the wit, spark or fun of that series at it's best; instead it is all a bit lifeless and flat.  The plot is good but it doesn't decide to be a mystery thriller until very late in the game; the final set piece is good but, because the film had been aiming for `playful' up till that point, it just doesn't work out well and it can't just suddenly create tension out of nowhere.The rest of the film tries to be light and witty but it doesn't manage it either.  A major fault in this regard is with the script; it doesn't have any really good lines or sequences.  As much as I accept that Woody Allen is not everyone's cup of tea, he would have been the perfect part of a writing team here - witty dialogue in The Thin Man style is really his thing.  The other problem is with the cast.  Nolte and Roberts may both be big names, but they sadly have ZERO chemistry and this is a big problem.  The two have no lines and their lack of spark just makes it worse, to compare this with the Thin Man series does that a great disservice.  The support cast fares a bit better and contains quite a few famous faces such as Rubinek, Rebhorn, Loggia, Dukakis, Levy, Martin Smith and Gleason.  They all do OK but they can't help the failings in the script, atmosphere and in the two stars.Overall this is just about watchable but it's hard to ignore what it clearly intended to be.  It is pretty much a big failure as it fails to amuse, excite or entertain on anywhere near the level that it was aiming for."
Was ik maar groot!,1988,7.3,"After wishing to be made big, a teenage boy wakes the next morning to find himself mysteriously in the body of an adult.","This movie is great. I mean, really. That's what every boy dreams of - becoming an adult overnight! It's absolutely gorgeous to see Tom Hanks' performance - that's real acting, it requires a lot to play this part as genuinely and cordial as he did. The message is so clear and so honest. The nostalgic edge is of such profound significance to the story. It's about the differences between being a kid and being an adult. It's about two very different perceptions of the same world that surrounds us. It's just us and how we make the best out of every day of our lives, and all it needs is to see the world through the eyes of a kid. A kid perceives all the things differently, with much more native and modest simplicity - the keystone to imagination and magic, the keystone to cherish the daily miracles in our lives. This movie has a deep and very pervasive message. It has so much charm and vitality mingled with nostalgia and witchcraft. One of those movies I enjoyed watching when I was a kid. Recommended."
K√©t f√©lid√∂ a pokolban,1961,7.9,"On Hitler's birthday, the Germans decide to organize a soccer match between prisoners of war and Germans.","On 6th August 1942 a team of Ukrainian prisoners of war comprising mainly former professional footballers played a team representing National Socialist Germany. The Ukrainians won 5-1. Three days later a 'revenge' match was played, attended by 2000 spectators, in which the Ukrainians again emerged victorious to the tune of 5-3.In 1946 the myth of the 'Death Match' emerged in Stalin's Russia(where else?) which claimed that the Ukrainian players were killed by the Nazis as a punishment for winning. This myth was further perpetrated under Brezhnev in the 1960's but has long since been discredited.Whether or not director Zolt√°n Fabr√≠ regarded the 'Death Match' as fact or fiction, he and his co-writer P√©ter Dacs√≥ have used it as inspiration for this simply splendid film which they have transposed to an Hungarian labour camp.In order to celebrate the birthday of Hitler, affectionately referred to by the prisoners as the 'house painter', a football match is to be played between the prisoners and a German team. On√≥di, the only professional footballer in the camp, is given the well-nigh Herculean task of cobbling together and training from scratch a raggle-taggle team. He agrees to do this in exchange for his players receiving better food rations. To cut a long story short the prisoners have somehow managed to level the game at 3-3 when the impartial Italian referee awards them a penalty. Already under sentence of death for having tried to escape, the team knows that if On√≥di scores the winning goal the chances of survival are slim. Will he take the penalty.......?I have only recently discovered Zolt√°n Fabr√≠ and my admiration for his skills increases with each one I see. His films show a grasp of character, sense of composition and an unbeatable combination of measured pace and momentum. He has here the services of his favoured Ferencn√© Sz√©cs√©nyi behind the camera and a tremendous cast headed by Imre Sinkovits as On√≥di, none of whom is ever caught 'acting'.There are those who say that Football brings people together but from what I have observed of fans' behaviour, it would seem to have the opposite effect. In Fabr√≠'s film of course it is not just a game but literally a matter of Life and Death.Subsequent versions cannot hold a candle to this one and that it has thus far only attracted two reviews(including mine!) is deeply depressing."
Keeping the Faith,2000,6.4,"Two friends, a priest and a rabbi, fall in love with the same woman they knew in their youth, but the religious position of both men denies them romance.","""Keeping the Faith"" is just hip enough to breathe some fresh air into a stagnating genre without sacrificing the requisite ""feel good"" moments in the process. The film's 2+ hour run time is a bit long for it's simple plot, but it manages to stay focused and dish up enough creativity to make it time well spent. A very enjoyable fun flick."
Carrie,2013,5.8,"A shy girl, outcast by her peers and sheltered by her religious mother, unleashes telekinetic terror on her small town after being pushed too far at her senior prom.","Disclaimer: this movie can prove to be ""scarrie"" for those who are not a fan of the horror genre in general. For those of us who are, at least for me, this movie was everything but scary. First of all, when I heard that Chloe Moretz will be taking the role of Carrie, I was afraid that she might not be able to pull it off. In fact, the only thing I was pleased to hear was that Julianne Moore will be playing Carrie's mother. She is a great choice for the role but the way she handled it, as well as everything else about this movie is - over the top. I could sense the idea of wanting to make a good remake of a classic, but in the end they just missed it... Chloe Moretz is a very good, promising young actress, I don't even wanna talk about acting abilities of Julianne Moore, but they just didn't seem real here. What makes the original Carrie truly disturbing is that it's really slow paced. In its essence, it's a drama about a teenage girl that is being deprived of an ordinary teenage life and experiences that come with it due to her fanatically religious and psychologically extremely questionable mother, to put it lightly. And yes, the plot is pretty much the same and everything, but the general feel is that they rushed it. As I said, everything is over the top, the acting is exaggerated, the relationships between the characters are unconvincing, but it's biggest flaw is that you KNOW what's coming. You have Carrie doing her telekinesis stunts from the very beginning. It's almost as if she was practicing this skill from waaaaaay back, making pencils float around the room, flying the bread over to the toaster - you know, the usual stuff. So when the real thing was supposed to happen, the x was out of the equation making it quite frustrating to watch. It seems to me that, to make a remake of such a classic film you need to put so much thought and effort into every little detail to make it at least convincing enough, if you're not aiming to top the original. This movie seemed like someone got the idea ""hey let's make a remake of some classic horror movie... hmmm... which one should we pick... the Exorcist? no, that's to heavy. hey, how about Carrie? Sure! it has a young girl as a lead, we sure have plenty of those, and there's a mother - oh, no, don't tell me? are you thinking what I'm thinking? JULIANNE freakin' MOORE!"" And off they went with their brilliant idea and messed it all up. It was to hasty, it was thoughtless, unconvincing and at the end all I could to was to pick the flaws as I was comparing it to the original. I could go on and on about which aspects of the movie I disliked the most, instead I'll just give it a 4/10 and never watch it again. The 2013 version, at least."
The Last of the Mohicans,1992,7.6,Three Mohican trappers agree to protect the daughters of a British Colonel in the midst of the French and Indian War.,"First I saw the movie and got excited by the beautiful backdrop scenery. Then I found out that the two main historical events depicted, the siege and fall of Fort William Henry and the subsequent massacre, actually happened. So I saw the movie again. Then I read the book. Then I read a good book about the French and Indian War.This is an instance where the movie deviates from the book and is the better for it. Then I'm pleased with the fact that history wasn't tampered with, at least not too much. Historians aren't sure how the Fort William Henry massacre was triggered or how complete it was; it IS documented that the massacre actually happened. I find no historical record of Colonel Munro conducting any campaign of lodge-burning against the Huron; but then again it IS documented that Munro did not have any daughters. Those characters are in the book as well as the movie. Cooper invented them himself.The idea of Huron war parties raiding on the frontier doesn't pop up in the book or the historical record, but it's perfectly plausible; the native Americans fought that way all through the Coloinal period. The savagery of Native American warfare is depicted fairly accurately; all accounts I have confirm that. The concept of taking captives is depicted accurately too, for the reasons described.Being of the bent that I am, I find the dual love stories involving (1) the Cora Munro-Hawkeye-Major Heywood triangle and (2) the Uncas-Alice Munro relationship all well and good; they were done well enough. I was more fascinated by the historical backdrop and the very nice North Carolina scenery, which is supposed to mimic the Adirondacks, where the story is set.For those with time on their hands and money to spend, both Fort William Henry and Fort Carillon (better known as Fort Ticonderog) exist; they have been fully restored and are now historical museums. I visited Fort Ticonderoga when I was 12 years old, and found it fascinating. Now that I've seen this movie I want to go out that way again, start at Fort William and Henry and work my way North to Crown Point, learning all I can on the way.What I really recommend is to see the movie once, enjoying the scenery and the love stories, as well as the action. Then read ""The French and Indian War: Deciding the Fate of North America"" by Walter R. Borneman. Then see the movie again, from a different perspective."
Egri csillagok,1968,7.3,"1552, the great Turkish Empire wants to conquer Europe, and the world. The last stand is Hungarian Kingdom, and the castle of Eger. The brave soldiers decides they will fight till the end of their lives.","I just finished watching this Hungarian classic and I must say that it is a really nice movie, even though the movie is full of mistakes about the Turks. The Turkish music in the movie is kind of funny, reminds me of the old American movies about the Arabs and flying carpets. And the clothes, i just can not imagine a place where everybody dresses up like clowns. The director exaggerated some scenes, like the gypsy leaving his tribe and dancing for his death, come on, the real life is not a circus. But still, the movie was one of the best Hungarian movies I have seen. And I guess they didn't expect any foreigners to see this movie so they just wanted to make Hungarians a little bit patriotic. I am not judging this, I mean after seeing thousands of American movies with fake heroes I can easily handle this one. Anyway, I recommend this movie but don't take the script so serious (I know that it is from the famous novel Egri Csillagok but it is full of mistakes, the novel was written to make Hungarians proud since they were a slave nation for hundreds of years)."
Traffic,2000,7.5,"A conservative judge is appointed by the President to spearhead America's escalating war against drugs, only to discover that his teenage daughter is a crack addict. Two DEA agents protect an informant. A jailed drug baron's wife attempts to carry on the family business.","Traffic is a fantastic movie. Let's start with saying that.I just got back from seeing it, and it certainly rates as one of the best story-based drama's I've ever seen.  Being a big fan of movies with different storylines overlapping (as Magnolia) I was highly anticipating this movie. And of course the big oscar nominations and the prizes it already won made it even more desirable.It didn't let me down one bit. The different story's were all excellent. Being that the mexican one was in my opinion the best one. Especially Benicio Del Toro (remember him in Fear and Loathing in Las vegas, the BEST drugs movie ever) being absolutely brilliant. But also the storyline involving Michael Douglas with his problems dealing with a daughter on drugs (well acted out by newcomer Erika Christensen) is remarkable. The topic drugs is clearly highly talked about especially in the United States, and this is actually the first movie which shows all aspects of it. The dealing and smuggling, the addiction, the risks of being a narcotics agent and the political point of view. It's hard to find a film that's so complete, everyone will feel connected to one of the storylines because everyone deals with or has dealt with drugs before, even if it's just a one time mariuhana use. That's why this movie will appeal to a very large crowd.Anyway when you look at the flaws then maybe some will say that it takes too long, or that some of the scenes are a bit slow. But does everything go fastpaced in real life? It just tries to sketch a realistic view of handling with drugs. And maybe there isn't a lot of action going on, but that's not the goal of the movie.The only thing I found when watching the movie was that the switching between movielines happened a little too often. I'd preferred if it stayed with one story a little longer. Just a tiny flaw that I personally noted.Traffic is a film that has to sink in, when you start to think about it it just gets better and better. I can't wait for the official release here in Holland, so that I can see it again.Oscar for Del Toro in any case !!!!!! And throw in an oscar for best film too. It deserves it."
Timecode,2000,6.0,Four frames of simultaneous action that alternately follow a smitten lesbian lover as she obsesses over her partner's dalliances and the tense goings-on of a Hollywood film production company.,"You know, some times an 'idea' has never been done before because it should never be done.  This movie is a perfect example.  Why on earth would anybody think that people want to see a movie split into four quadrants?I mean, I could take a script as bad as this, and film it upside down.  Does that make it good because it is 'daring and original'?"
Eat Pray Love,2010,5.9,"A married woman realizes how unhappy her marriage really is, and that her life needs to go in a different direction. After a painful divorce, she takes off on a round-the-world journey to ""find herself"".","I think this was the first Julia Roberts film that I ever hated. I wanted to leave the theater before she left Rome, but was with my wife. After the film I found out she hated it as much as me. We did chat a little and thought it would make wonderful parody film--- picture Will Ferrell as a husband who is fed up and decides to travel to three cities... and visit The New York Yankees; The Dallas Cowboys; and the Los Angeles Lakers, as a way to get in touch with his inner man. Along the way there could be lots of drinking, cheering and preying on women in bars and cheerleaders. My favorite seen in the film was the end photo where it showed her former husband looking happy in his new family!"
Ut√≥√©let,2014,7.0,"A heavily neurotic young man starts to see his father's ghost, and while he helps the spirit cross to the otherworld, something happens that they could never achieve in their common life: they finally understand each other.","I've read many times in the last few years, that a Hungarian movie is either artsy and indigestible for the average cinema crowd or brainless replicas of brainless Hollywood blockbusters (also replicas). I think this isn't true. I love art movies and I don't think it is a bad thing to digest a piece of art. If you have to think it over and over again, it stays with you. Many of my favorite movies took me a while to chew over and they become part of my life - I refer to them, I think about them, even years after first seeing the movie. A long story short: I'm a fan of art flicks and not against a good(!) mainstream one. Now, Afterlife gets the best of both worlds: you can take it as a weird comedy flick, but you can dig deeper and it leaves you a lot to chew on. Zombor√°cz Vir√°g follows the ""Give the emperor what belongs to the emperor, and give God what belongs to God."" rule. She gives it both: art and entertainment. This is a kind of black comedy where you laugh, but it leaves a bitter taste. It reminds me Anders Thomas Jensen's Adam's Apples, but with an unmistakable Hungarian/eastern European taste. The actors are all great (I could list the whole cast), the casting was really good and the cinematography is excellent: you see great camera work and beautiful images. Everyday places made beautiful through artistic work, eg. in the beginning of the movie when M√≥zes (Krist√≥f M√°rton) sits in his ""cell"" or at the end on the boat. I won't go into details about the plot, because it's best is if you go watch this movie unprepared - don't read too much about it. In my opinion this is one of the movies of 2014, that's definitely worth seeing."
VAN valami furcsa √©s megmagyar√°zhatatlan,2014,7.4,A trip to Lisbon helps a nerdy guy who is quickly approaching 30 finally get his mojo back.,"Although partly set in Lisbon, this is essentially a Budapest movie that is finally able to show how does it feel to be a young adult in Hungary's capital.""For some inexplicable reason""'s real strength lies in its honestly - it doesn't feel like a bigger budget art movie, rather you feel like roaming around with your friends on the streets of your hometown. You may make some detours or find some odd details that may not add up to a thorough story on the way, but that is how real life works, isn't it?So what to expect when you meet those friends? You will laugh sometimes, you will be sad for a while, you will recall your own experiences (especially if you are twenty-something or from Central Europe)... and I guess you will recall some scenes and thoughts from the movie even days later.Surgeon general's warning: watching this movie may make you want to visit Budapest. Avoid it if your normal diet consists solely of Hollywood movie."
Forces of Nature,1999,5.5,A soon-to-be-married man encounters an exciting stranger after his plane suffers an accident on takeoff.,"FORCES OF NATURE / (1999) **""Forces of Natures"" is a romantic comedy that gradually builds for a presumably happy conclusion, but completely disregards its momentum in the end, making this movie a hypocrite of itself. Although advancing through this story is sometimes amiable fun, the ending results are forgettable and pointless.The movie's entire story is a series of uncanny coincidences ranging from heart attacks and drug busts to robbery and fires. Book-jacket blurbologist Ben Holmes (Ben Affleck), is becoming married to his fianc√©e, Bridget (Maura Tierney), in two days. At his bachelor party in New York, a stripper excites his grandfather into cardiac arrest. Ben stays with his relative a little while then catches a flight back to Georgia where Bridget is waiting.Ben meets a young woman making out with her romantic interest at the airport. This woman, the pretty Sarah Lewis (Sandra Bullock), later ends up sitting next to him on the plane. Ben is a very nervous flyer, and when his flight crashes before it leaves the ground he becomes even more profoundly afraid of flying.He and Sarah buddy-up with a man at the port hitching a ride to his wedding destination. This man turns out to be a criminal, however, and is busted with the unlikely pair in the car with him.Many more events occur keeping Ben away from his wedding location. Such circumstances include a train wreck, a striptease, and mistaken identity. His parents (Michael Fairman and Janet Carroll), are not happy with his findings or state of affairs.The film's conflict is getting Ben from New York to Savannah, Ga. to wed with his fianc√©e. No recent structure complicates its initial problem as clearly as ""Forces of Nature,"" imaginatively written by  Marc Lawrence. The gradual increase of passion between Ben and Sarah makes for rich romantic chemistry, although there is none developed between Bridget and Ben. ""Forces of Nature"" concentrates on creating chemistry with Sarah and Ben, but never with Bridget. I did not know what to believe. Is Ben in love with Sarah in which he has known for only a few days, or is his heart with his eagerly waiting to wed fianc√©e?Lame conversations featuring Ben and Bridget on a bed videotaping themselves enhances what little character development present. Such lame dialogue present includes ""I'm scared"" and ""It's the rest of our lives."" Why doesn't the movie show us how the two characters feel about marriage instead of explaining it?""Forces of Nature"" contains an interesting style, consisting of neat camera effects, scenes cut short, believable cinematography and jaunty soundtrack numbers. Some of the film's style is over the top, however. There is a magical hailstorm sequence that plays like a music video on MTV. And most of the film's laughs come from witty one liners, not the many incidences of stylish film making.Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock are the right choices for Ben and Sarah. They bring forth effective performances thanks in part to stylish directing and cleverly written dialogue. Most of the final segments of the second act are spent on Ben making a decision between spending his life with Bridget or Sarah. Though the entire second act  is wasted anyway in the manner this movie concludes itself.""Forces of Nature"" is a movie too silly for serious romantics and overly thought-provoking for audiences looking for a good laugh. Teenagers may identify with the film's glossy look. But for most viewers, this is just a music video with plot."
"Liza, a r√≥kat√ºnd√©r",2015,7.5,"Liza's a nurse, seeking love. Her only company is a long-dead Japanese pop star, who turns her into a fox-fairy out of jealousy. Now, every men who desires Liza shall die horribly. Can she overcome the curse?","Liza, the Fox-fairy is one of the most pleasant surprises I ever had watching a Hungarian movie. The cinematography and scenery were beautiful, the actors did an excellent job. The idea of adding Japanese pop culture and mythology to a fictional capitalistic 70's Hungarian scenery might seem a little far fetched at first, but it really works well. The story was captivating.Most reviewers mention Jean-Pierre Jeunet's 'Am√©lie' and Wes Anderson's movies as probable inspirations. I have to agree, but these influences are not explicit at all, they stay on a vibe level. Also I have to add, it's way darker than those movies and that it has more of a 'Delicatessen' mood, (also) a Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro movie.Anyway, if you like weird love stories with dark twists and dark humor you should definitely give this movie a chance."
Sex Actually,2014,7.0,The secret lives of five suburban couples living in Sydney reveal both the fetishes and the repercussions that come with sharing them.,"This film was written directed and completed to perfection. Initially I was a bit hesitant about getting tickets for it at TIFF. But my instinct and intuition told me to go for it. And as is the case most of the time it was a winner. From the start to the finish the whole theatre was trying to anticipate what would happen next. Never knowing and never being able to foresee the next scene.With every scene change, with every twist and turn we we laughing hysterically. I viewed a number of good films at TIFF this year, like every other year. But this well be one I see again, and have already recommended it to all of my fiends. You must see this film as soon as you can, and i am sure you will find it entertaining, refreshing, enlightening and compared to most of the films out their today this is like a breath of fresh air."
Laggies,2014,6.4,"In the throes of a quarter-life crisis, Megan panics when her boyfriend proposes. She takes an opportunity to escape for a week, hiding out in the house of her new 16-year-old friend Annika and her world-weary single dad.","A woman who is approaching her thirties and still doesn't know what she wants from life (like most of us, I would say), accidentally meets a teenager and uses her to escape responsibility, at least for a short time. A romantic comedy elevated from mediocrity by a rather realistic depiction of the mental state that most of us go through at some point in our lives. Some go through it maturely and responsibly, even painlessly, but many bring themselves into tragicomic situations as the heroine of this film. Partly because I found myself in this story to some extent, and partly because of Keira Knightley and Chlo√´ Grace Moretz, I have to rate it at least a little higher than it objectively deserves.7/10"
Birdman,2014,7.7,"A washed-up superhero actor attempts to revive his fading career by writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway production.","I'm not exaggerating when I rate this movie a 10/10. From the first minute it's intriguing, you want to keep watching, not just for the impeccable performances, but for the incredible montage of scenes and the quality of the script. And best of all, as time goes on, the movie gets better in every way. Without a doubt, it is one of the best films in the history of cinema."
The Invention of Lying,2009,6.4,"A comedy set in a world where no one has ever lied, until a writer seizes the opportunity for personal gain.","""The Invention of Lying"" begins with a series of truths, which in our world today nobody says because, well, we can lie, but in this world nobody can. It's funny in a very basic way, and it gets old quick. But then, Ricky Gervais discovers how to lie.Along with Gervais, we learn a lot about society, and we see all the inherent humour. This humour actually has a fair number of levels to it. On one level, humanity is very base, but the great thing about lying is that we actually get to a level where we can find the good in people. This movie is for everybody who has ever been called short, fat or ugly, and for all those people who see that it's always the good looking people who get everything they want in the world. But Gervais is now here to stand up for us, and just let us laugh.""The Invention of Lying"" is filled with one-liners, intelligent wit and the ultimate truth to our world. It's also filled with many recognizable actors, all there to make the movie shinier and brighter. Jennifer Garner at one point tells our hero, ""I like the way you see the world."" Well, so do I, Mr. Gervais, so do I."
The Paperboy,2012,5.7,A reporter returns to his Florida hometown to investigate a case involving a death row inmate.,"Lee Daniels' follow-up to the powerful Precious is an atmospheric work of Southern Gothic, based on a novel by Pete Dexter. Some might be precious (!) about their favourite books, but great films have been made which bear little resemblance to their source material, as fans of Dr Strangelove will know. I wouldn't call The Paperboy great, but with weightless yawners like Hansel & Gretel and Oz currently clogging the cinema, its rawness and energy is like licking an electric fence. In a good way. Grainy, saturated and wilfully unfocused, The Paperboy is a reminder of the power of 2D.Matthew McConaughey continues his resurgence, tapping into a hitherto hidden vulnerability. He plays Ward Jansen, a journalist who arrives in the back-of-beyond with his partner, Yardley (David Oyelowo). They're in town to write a story about the unlawful conviction of Hilary Van Wetter (John Cusack). To entice him they employ Charlotte (Nicole Kidman, fearless), who's in love with Hilary, or the idea of Hilary. Finally, and centrally, there is scared, smouldering Jack Jansen, played by a very capable Zac Efron.Jack wants to steal Charlotte away from all this: the alligator-gutters and the insufferable heat. Nicole thinks he knows nothing because he's young, but one of the films myriad themes is the value of youthful idealism: Jack is the only one of the main characters yet to plunge down a rabbit-hole of hopelessness and self-service. There is genuine affection on show, though, of the brotherly kind between Ward and Jack, and the motherly kind between Jack and Anita (a subtle and funny Macy Gray; further proof of Daniels' aptitude for bringing the best and least showy from musicians-turned-actors).The film is ramshackle and imperfect - but this kind of works. It skitters along with little attention paid to the audience, with precise relationships between characters rarely spelled out, and chunks of action entirely elided. It's not quite as funny or bleak as the similarly southern-fried Killer Joe, but I do believe that The Paperboy has a more humanist agenda than William Friedkin's film, basically emerging on the side of people, broken as they often become.Like Precious, this is a film containing difficult individual scenes, and a troubling ambivalence about whether we're investing in a set of real characters or peering at them through museum glass. But there's no doubt, when the camera starts rolling, that Daniels sets out to challenge his audience. In that respect, he has succeeded."
Devil's Knot,2013,6.1,The savage murders of three young children sparks a controversial trial of three teenagers accused of killing the kids as part of a Satanic ritual.,"I have seen a lot of people trash this film, and if you are looking for something on the level of Angelina Jolie's ""Changeling"", you will be disappointed. If though, you are tolerant of a low budget but effective dramatization of a very tangled, disturbing, and tragic story about 3 young boys losing their lives to murder and 3 young men losing their lives to a group of detectives and justice system blinded by emotion, you will appreciate this film. Reece is fantastic as the mom of one of the victims. She is the big name in the film, though you will recognize several actors who are not quite up to her level of star power. I am a bit of a junkie on this case, and I was not disappointed. I think it does a fair job of presenting the defense's perspective. Granted, if you think they are guilty, and there are many who do, then you will be angered by its presentation. Nonetheless, I was very pleased with it."
Samba,2014,6.7,Senegalese Samba has worked 10 years in France. He's arrested and befriends the woman helping him with legal matters as volunteer after a burnout at work. He's released after being told to leave France. Chemistry?,"First of all, Samba is not a movie about dancing. I guess we all know that but I really felt like making this joke. Forgive my sometimes childish spirit. Samba is an enjoyable movie about a subject we are all aware of: ilegal immigrants. Unfortunately, ilegal immigrants are not our primary concern and I doubt anyone wastes more than 5 seconds a year thinking about them and their situation.Samba is a nice young man from Senegal who finds himself as close to being deported as when he arrived in Paris ten years back. During this decade in Paris, he worked in all sorts of jobs to take care of his family back home, and hoping to one day legalize his situation. In his particular struggle surviving in France and hiding from the police, he will find 3 people to rely on: his uncle who gives him a roof, a funny Arabic man who like him does not have a visa, and a french girl who is helping immigrants while taking a break from her real job.The adventures of our protagonist will make you laugh, and they will make you sad. Either way, they are a clear representation of the reality for thousands of men who are completely forgotten by the world, and who were born to struggle. More than men, they are like ghosts in our cities.As a conclusion, I would said, this is not the best movie I have seen by any means, but clearly a movie I am happy to have watched. I am not going to become a social worker just yet, but at least, the thought of these brave men will stay with me for more than a few seconds I previously dedicated to their cause."
Goal! The Dream Begins,2005,6.7,The extremely talented Santiago Mu√±ez is spotted by a Newcastle United scout and given a chance at professional football.,"In the mix of all sports movies, when a movie is made for soccer, the expectations of the audience, is a thousand fold. This is because most of the Soccer Movie goers are soccer (football) fans. Football fans are not so forgiving when it comes to the football scenes. This movie captures the scenes fantastically. It shows real football. The filmmaker knows football. The stars know football. The cameramen know football.This is independent film-making at its best. It has the main plot which is the struggle of an athlete to achieve his dream. It has side plots which involve his relationships with his father, his new found girlfriend and his grandmother. His interactions with his brother and his teammates are great. But probably the most important event of his life has to do with the lucky break he gets when a former player turned scout sees him play. From there, the dream begins for the star of the movie and the audience as well.This movie is highly recommended."
Hooligans,2005,7.4,"A wrongfully expelled Harvard undergrad moves to London, where he is introduced to the violent underworld of football hooliganism.","First of all there hasn't been a good film about English Football Hooliganism. Both ID in 1995 and last years FOOTBALL FACTORY either failed to convince or just went down the familiar exploitative road of glamorising the buzz and thrill of violence.HOOLIGANS as the title suggests depicts what these aforementioned films centre upon with the added value of having a story and characters you care about. There's no avoiding the clich√©'s as the ranks of these organised gang members are portrayed as gangsters.Similar to BBC's Gary Oldman drama THE FIRM broadcast in 1986 it also show the characters as normal members of society, family men with respectable jobs. FOOTBALL FACTORY took the extreme and unconvincing scenario that these weekend animals are florist's during the week which might be amusing but the subject matter of organised territorial football hooliganism needs to be given a serious look at.Fortunately HOOLIGANS portrays this more realistically, sure there's the stereo types in designer clothes (The Chavs) as we call them now where loyalty, respect, revenge, dignity and pride are what they live for, not the enjoyment of the actual sport. This simply acts as the excuse to fight in a traditional gang warfare environment. The prospect of West Ham's cup tie with Millwall brings joy to the faces of both sets of fans.Casting Elijah Wood is a bold move, he looks like a Choirboy but this adds to the films main storyline of innocence corrupted. The acting is better than average, despite letting his cockney accent slip on occasions, Gang leader Charlie Hunnam shows a genuine mix of anger, aggression and compassion which holds the film together.This won't win awards but it's refreshing to see a film finally tackling the subject matter that unfortunately has been a shameful factor of Britain's attitude towards football as we are constantly under threat of being disqualified from International tournaments due to the bad behaviour of soccer hooligans."
The 13th Warrior,1999,6.6,"A man, having fallen in love with the wrong woman, is sent by the sultan himself on a diplomatic mission to a distant land as an ambassador. Stopping at a Viking village port to restock on supplies, he finds himself unwittingly embroiled in a quest to banish a mysterious threat in a distant Viking land.","This is an extremely well crafted film, but a poorly edited one. Much like The Ghost and the Darkness it has such a winning historical concept that it is easy to forgive a little narrative incoherency from time to time. This film is a bit muddled when it comes to plot and characterization but hits all the right notes in terms of creating an adventurous spirit and thrilling action sequences. Jerry Goldsmith's score is a real high point, as is the cinematography. This is an absolutely wonderful film to get all caught up in on a lonely night because it makes you feel as if you are on the journey with Banderas' character. It is an action thriller that is actually...thrilling. In particular the scene with the ""fire dragon"" is one of the more memorable battle sequences I have seen in any movie, and I really mean that. The only negative aspects of the film are the feeling that a lot of scenes were left on the editing room floor, which is true, and if there was ever a film that really deserved a director's cut this is certainly one of them so long as Jerry Goldsmith's music (the soul of the picture) remains in. (Greame Revell composed a score for the unreleased longer version, which I have heard and in no way compares to Goldsmith's thunderous adventure music). The lavish costumes, set designs, memorable characters, and brilliant camera work somehow allow this film to overcome its editorial handicaps. All being said, this is a film well worth watching."
Rollerball,2002,3.1,The big thing in 2005 is a violent sport which can have some pretty serious consequences... like dying.,"I was really speechless after watching ""Rollerball"". I expected a dull movie, not something so dreadful. ""Rollerball"" has all the elements to make one of those bizarre cult classics from the 70's and 80's. Except the fun element.The movie starts with the worst police chase in years. Believe me, any Lorenzo Lamas movie, even one featuring appearances from Dolph Lundgren, can be capable of a car chase better than this: we see Chris Klein running from police in a mix of skateboard and racing-car, in San Francisco. Then, helped by his friend LL Cool J., he goes to an Asiatic country. There, the most popular game is the Rollerball, a mix of basketball and roller-skating that seems to be deadly and a great money-maker. Rollerball is controlled by Jean Reno's character, the average ""mad-business-man"" stereotype. Then, we learn that Chris Klein is having an affair with his Rollerball partner, Rebbeca Romjin-Stamos.What comes next is not worth telling. Of course, Chris, LL and Rebbeca will make a rebellion against Jean Reno. But there isn't anything new in this idea. It's wasted by a script that, once tries to make a cheap social critic, then tries to shove action sequences in the screen at all coasts, and both are really bad.The acting is at the last level. It's incredible to see Jean Reno, an actor that is mostly great (watch ""Red Rivers"") making such a mess with his role. It's so stereotyped and has so less to do (despite it's importance in the plot) that you can completely forget about it. LL Cool J. is a special case: he keep going well for a while, and then completely disappears, showing that, maybe, good acting wasn't allowed in Rollerball rules.Oh, the main couple. Chris Klein and Rebbeca Romjin-Stamos. Well, Rebbeca is incredibly sexy in this role, and it's nice to see her in topless scenes, so we can forget she's so bad here. And Klein. Let's just say Chris Klein will NEVER work in an action movie anymore. At least we hope so.In the end, the movie is a complete mess. Is not only a waste of money, but also waste of time, celluloid and Jean Reno. That is a complete sin. It feels like director John McTiernan wanted so badly to make a stylish movie that he forgot to make a good movie."
12 Monkeys,1995,8.0,"In a future world devastated by disease, a convict is sent back in time to gather information about the man-made virus that wiped out most of the human population on the planet.","Normally I try to avoid Sci-Fi movies as much as I can, because this just isn't a genre that really appeals to me. Light sabers, UFO's, aliens, time traveling... most of the time it's nothing for me. However, there is one movie in the genre that I'll always give a place in my list of top movies and that's this ""Twelve Monkeys"" I remember to be completely blown away by it the first time, but even now, after having it seen several times already, I'm still one of its biggest fans. Every time I see it, this movie seems to get better and better.Somewhere in the distant future all people live underground because an unknown and lethal virus wiped out five billion people in 1996, leaving only 1 percent of the population alive. James Cole is one of them. He's a prisoner who lives in a small cage and who is chosen as a 'volunteer' to be sent back to in time to gather information about the origin of the epidemic. They believe it was spread by a mysterious group called 'The Twelve Monkeys' and need the virus before it mutated, so that scientists can study it. But their time traveling machine doesn't work perfectly yet and he is accidentally sent to 1990, where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly, a psychiatrist, and Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert...What I like so much about this movie is the fact that it is never clear whether all what you are seeing is real or not. Is this just an illusion, created in the mind of a mentally ill man or is it real? Does he really come from the future and can he really travel through time? Was the population really wiped out by a virus, released by the army of The Twelve Monkeys? Those are all questions that will leave you wondering from the beginning until the end. If the makers of this movie had chosen to make it all more obvious, I'm sure that I would never have liked it as much as I did now. It's just that mysteriousness that keeps me interested time after time. But that's not the only good thing about this movie of course. The acting is amazing too. Normally I'm not too much a fan of Bruce Willis, but what he did in this movie was just astonishing. Together with Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt he should have won several awards for it, because together with the amazing story, they made this movie work so incredibly well.Even after several viewings, I'm still a huge fan of this movie. Except for this movie, I have only seen one other Terry Gilliam movie and that's ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", which wasn't bad, but didn't really convince me either. However, it's this movie that really makes me look forward to his other work. I give it a 9/10, maybe even a 9.5/10."
Pandorum,2009,6.7,"Two crew members of a spaceship wake up from hypersleep to discover that all their colleagues are missing. Despite this, it appears that they are not alone.","Better than you'd expect. I was shocked that movies like this.. can still sell and be good enough to watch. The theater was packed. Nobody was disappointed. Grade A- acting. Intense action! New superstars will emerge from this one. I won't spoil it by telling you who. You'll see. Rating >> 8.1Antibodies director Christian Alvart takes suspense into space with this tale of two astronauts who realize that they aren't alone as they drift into the darkest corners of our galaxy. Awakening in their hyper-sleep chamber with no memory of who they are or what their mission is, disoriented astronauts Lt. Payton (Dennis Quaid) and Corporal Bower (Ben Foster) gradually surmise that they are the only ones aboard the darkened spacecraft. But how did they get here, and what are those strange sounds coming from the belly of the ship? The only way out of their hyper-sleep chamber is a narrow air shaft, and the only one small enough to climb through it is Corporal Bower. As the younger of the two space travelers shimmies inside, the older remains behind to offer guidance on the radio transmitter. But the deeper Corporal Bower ventures into the ship, the more apparent it becomes that something horrible has happened. Could it be that the survival of the entire human race rests in the hands of these two astronauts stuck on a lonely ship in deep space?"

Eg√©szs√©ges erotika,1986,7.4,"An all-woman crate factory's new fireman installs a hidden camera in the women's dressing room for the male management's pleasure, eventually boosting business.",I can't rate this....the 0 is missing....this is shame of Hungarian movies.
9,2009,7.0,A rag doll that awakens in a postapocalyptic future holds the key to humanity's salvation.,"The first time I heard about 9 and found out that Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov were co-producing it, I was absolutely on board to see it. Anything that the guy who directed such quirky masterpieces as Beetlejuice, Batman, Mars Attacks!, Ed Wood, and Sleepy Hollow got behind had to be worthy of my time. And then you add the genius of Russian director Timur Bekmambetov to the mix and to me it was a no brainer. I was going to see this movie. Burton AND the guy that has brought us such visually complex and action-packed fare as Wanted, Night Watch, and Day Watch supporting a movie? It had to be good.And it was. Director Shane Acker borrows maybe a little more than he should have visually from other such apocalyptic films like Terminator and even Wall-E, but it doesn't end up hurting the film by any means. The scenery and landscapes of the film are beautifully crafted and set everything up for a certain feeling of loneliness and hopelessness. It's more graphic and suspenseful than any children's or youth feature you would take your kids to, so definitely don't let the fact that this is animated fool you. This is not for the little ones.The voice actors all put their best foot forward and deliver. You've got Elijah Wood as 9, once again convincingly leading a group of survivors in what seems to be an unwinnable war against a much larger foe than they could be expected to defeat. You've got Christopher Plummer playing 1 as an interesting paranoid ""keeper of the secrets"" which reminded me of the Dr. Zaius character in the original Planet of the Apes films, if you've seen any of those. Legendary actor Martin Landau plays 2, who is a scientist and fixes 9. Then there's Jennifer Connelly, who plays the strong-willed and rebellious 7 who has left the core group of ""stitchpunks"" to get away from under all of 1's rules. Last but not least, you've got Crispin Glover playing the slightly obsessed and seemingly crazy 6 who has been drawing strange symbols since the big war between the humans and machines.The film had an interesting plot that got a bit more complex in the end. Part of the complexity had a spiritual vibe to it that I didn't necessarily care for. It just seemed almost out of place and like the director was stretching for something that would make the film more ""sophisticated."" I was not disappointed in the movie by any means. It was a visually striking piece of film. It was action-packed and fun without dumbing down the story or sacrificing it. If you're into sci-fi, apocalyptic thrillers, and animation I would highly recommend this."
Tomorrow Never Dies,1997,6.5,James Bond sets out to stop a media mogul's plan to induce a war between China and the United Kingdom.,"It is more like a remake of the overused formula plot of old Bond movies where a megalomaniac steals and strikes the superpowers from a hideout to create a misunderstanding and start WWIII and become the principal bargainer in the process. It lacked intrigue, suspense, twists, not that many of Bond movies have that, but was far too straightforward, predictable and cliche. I always liked Brosnan , he is one of the better Bonds I felt, hope he had something more play to with in the opportunities he got to play this iconic character. 6/10"
The Chronicles of Riddick: Rule the Dark,2013,6.4,"Left for dead on a sun-scorched planet, Riddick finds himself up against an alien race of predators. Activating an emergency beacon alerts two ships: one carrying a new breed of mercenary, the other captained by a man from Riddick's past.","Just saw the movie and loved it. I greatly enjoyed the first and second films so I've been looking forward to this since it was announced. It's a great sci-fi bad-ass action movie. Plenty of cheesy one-liners and good action scenes set in a sci-fi world.The story wasn't anything spectacular, no breaking new ground here but it does set the stage for the next (hope we get a next!!!!). Graphics were well-done, alien life wasn't anything unique but were suitably scary.If you liked the 1st and/or 2nd film you'll enjoy this. It pays more homage to the 1st than the 2nd. Vin Diesel does another great job acting as Riddick and you'll be cheering for the anti-hero as usual.I personally am hoping the series continues, can't get enough of this! hope you enjoy!"
Licence to Kill,1989,6.7,A vengeful James Bond goes rogue to infiltrate and take down the organization of a drug lord who has murdered his friend's new wife and left him near death.,"Licence To Kill is one of the most underrated Bond movies since On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Slipping easily back into 007's shoes with style after his previous role as Bond, Timothy Dalton embodies the character. With a break away from the comic-book villains and fantastical locations, the filmmakers decide to focus instead on a very adult and contemporary story about drug smuggling and revenge. Michael G. Wilson and Richard Maibaum's story is engaging and exciting, with a steadfast confidence in their leading man. This is a Bond movie that took risks -- it was the first 15-rated Bond film in the UK -- and surely deserves kudos for doing so. Make no mistake; this is not a family Bond picture. Its themes require a more mature perspective than its predecessors, and the violence is certainly stronger than anything that had come before. Unfortunately, these factors seem to be what critics of Licence To Kill call 'faults'. But why is change so bad, I ask? Casino Royale is getting major appreciation from critics for its grittiness and its darker edge. So why not Licence To Kill? After all, this is the movie that started the current trend, with Dalton's mature portrayal of Bond paving the way for Pierce Brosnan and, without doubt, Daniel Craig. It always amazes me that people do not give Dalton more respect for what he did with the character. This guy started the ball rolling. And boy did he give it a hard push.The characters in Licence To Kill are one of it's major plus points. James Bond is the most human we have seen him in 20 years, as Dalton brings a real sense emotional depth to the character; a tortured man full of hurt and pain and vengeance, his determined and stony face almost cracking with the burning hatred that is barely contained inside of him. We also get a strong female lead with Carey Lowell, whose portrayal of Pam Bouvier is at once intelligent, sexy, and funny. On the flip side of the coin, we have a genuinely terrifying villain in the shape of Robert Davi, playing his role deadly straight with not a hint of camp. It's a rare scenario where you feel Bond has met someone of equal competence. The Sanchez character is a frightening presence, and an early role from Benicio Del Toro is just as effective; his chilling grin a fear-inducing sight.Technically speaking, John Glen's direction is taught and assured, with the pace never really letting up for the 130+ minutes running time, save at the very end of the movie where the spectacular truck chase sequence perhaps drags just a little. The brilliant Michael Kamen also supplies us with an elegant, sensual and brooding score that is a vital player unto itself, complimenting the visuals excellently.In spite of these pluses, there are some minor quibbles. As I said before, the truck finale is perhaps a bit long, even though the stunt work is amazing, but it does slow the pace a bit. Talisa Soto is indeed beautiful as Sanchez' girlfriend but, bless her, she isn't exactly the most talented actress on the planet. She plays her part well enough, but the role isn't exactly Oscar-worthy, and it's not helped by the fact that the script tends to relegate her to the sidelines. Everett McGill's cigar-chomping Killifer is rather too pantomime for me - he just doesn't stand up to the characters of Sanchez or Anthony Zerbe's Krest but he doesn't stick around long so doesn't get in the way too much.With a striking leading man in Bond's shoes, Licence To Kill deserves a lot more credit than it gets. This is the film that broke the mould, opening the doors to a more adult, violent Bond world that continued briefly with some of the Brosnan films and certainly with Daniel Craig's portrayal of the character. In Timothy Dalton we have a brilliant actor in the starring role who brought us a more human and believable Bond, yet it is Daniel Craig who is currently getting the credit for these exact traits. Don't get me wrong, his characterisation is superb. But Dalton is the one who started it off, and it is a shame that he only made the two films.John Glen says that from all of the Bond movies that he directed, Licence To Kill is the one he is most proud of. And rightly so. Not only do we get a more fleshed-out character in Bond than previous outings, we get a more believable and mature storyline, with great characters and competent direction. Definitely one of the most underrated Bond movies, this engaging film is a great piece of entertainment, and one that I hope will gather praise with time. See it.4 stars."
Dennis the Menace,1993,5.7,"When his parents must go out of town on business, Dennis stays with Mr. and Mrs. Wilson. He is driving Mr. Wilson crazy, but he is just trying to be helpful, even to the thief who has arrived in town.","""Dennis the Menace"" is unique in its own way because it's observant.  This movie made me laugh at stuff i've always laughed at and things i'd never thought I would laugh at.  The film can be surprisingly innocent at times and sincere and heartwarming.  And the kid who plays Dennis is a way better actor than Macaulay Culkin.  I liked the film for its imagination and humor.  A good film.  I also liked how they showed Dennis trying to resist the temptation to do something bad but can't resist."
Flushed Away,2006,6.6,"The story of an uptown rat that gets flushed down the toilet from his penthouse apartment, ending in the sewers of London, where he has to learn a whole new and different way of life.","This film didn't sound appealing to me when I first heard about it; a rat society living in the underground waterways of England wasn't my idea of an interesting movie. But, I was invited to see a screening of it recently, and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised after seeing it! This film is different, exciting, adventurous, and fun to watch! I liked Rita (Kate Winslet) the best, but that's if I had to choose one character. Roddy (Hugh Jackman) was the star though. The little slugs singing on the side are cute in their own way too. The underlying message of how important family and friends are is well done. It's great for the whole family!"
"Back to the future, deel 3",1990,7.5,"Stranded in 1955, Marty McFly learns about the death of Doc Brown in 1885 and must travel back in time to save him. With no fuel readily available for the DeLorean, the two must figure how to escape the Old West before Emmett is murdered.","Marty and doc are back, but in another time. They go to the West in 1885 in order to save Doc's life and from then on the Western adventure takes place. It's a pity that so many people disliked the third movie because, in my humble opinion, it's a great finale to this fantastic trilogy. It is very well written with rich characters and clever dialogues. This third part does differ in the sense that it's set in the West and has less of the futuristic gadgets and gizmos (obviously, since it's not set in the distant future but you'll still see a few including a time-travelling freight train) but it still retains the same energy, a different kind of action and it pays a nice homage to Western classics. Fox and Lloyd continue their roles of the teen hero and the crazy doctor (and it never gets old) but this time there's a new female lead. Mary Steenburgen delivers a hilariously wonderful performance as the ditsy Clara. She and Lloyd are funny and sweet together. Clara is the perfect lady for Doc and Steenburgen fits the part like a glove. This time, Lea Thompson appears as an Irish settler. Zemeckis has brilliantly picked up from where the second one ended. The film ends on a delightful note and I would have liked to see more 'Back to The Future' movies. But, I'm still very pleased with the way it is. There have been only very few trilogies that have impressed me overall. My list includes names like Ray's 'Apu Trilogy' and Coppola's 'Godfather' trilogy and of course Zemeckis's 'Back To The Future' movies."
Turner & Hooch,1989,6.2,A detective must adopt a rambunctious dog in order to help him find a killer.,"Hanks and Beasley make for an odd couple but they are clearly the best thing about the film. In terms of storyline of 'Turner & Hooch' is not developed from a novel concept, the humorous treatment and the hilarious and endearing interaction between the lead pair is what makes it a charming little film. Tom Hanks is totally great in one of his early roles as a policeman who suffers from perfectionism and is challenged by the entrance of a pooch into his life. The guy shows a flair for comedy that has hardly been noticed by many filmmakers. Beasley is fantastic and absolutely adorable (once you get passed the drooling). Mare Winningham is good as Hanks's love interest. They are quite convincing enough as a romantic pair. There are plenty of wonderful moments in the film and it is hard to pick a favourite but the first scenes that come to mind are the stakeout scene where Turner is chatting with a bored Hooch and the scene where he comforts a grieving Hooch. I love the film for its simplicity and heart along Hanks and Beasley. An awesome fun little flick!"
Dirty Dancing,1987,7.1,"Spending the summer at a Catskills resort with her family, Frances ""Baby"" Houseman falls in love with the camp's dance instructor, Johnny Castle.","You cant get any better then this, Mr Jeffries!!  Patrick Swayze is hot and Jen Grey portrays the role of Baby nicely....the dancing rocks and the music is slamming GO Baby GO!!!"
GoldenEye,1995,7.2,"When a powerful secret defense system is stolen, James Bond is assigned to stop a Russian crime syndicate from using it.","After a 6 year hiatus due to protracted legal wranglings as to WHO owned the BOND film rights, GOLDENEYE was finally made! It was worth the wait! With the almost impossible assignment of both retaining the quintessential METHOD of the Connery period and the need to drag Bond screaming into the new millennium and its new technology, Martin Campbell actually pulled it off.Brosnan, though not my personal favorite I have to say, did a damn near remarkable job, by not only bringing elements of Connery, Dalton and Moore to the role, but by stamping it with his own identity (he WAS actually first choice ahead of Dalton but was contractually tied to REMINGTON STEELE and could not gain a release!)Wishing to link back with the earlier mega successful Bonds, the very title of GOLDENEYE was inspirational, immediately bringing to mind the latent image of GOLDFINGER. Not one half bad title song either compared to some recent efforts.With Bernard Lee's sad demise, Judy Dench made a brilliant replacement as M, all balls and bravado. Similarly, Moneypenny is now a strictly new-age secretary admonishing 007 for his sexual harassment of her good self! Dearest of all, Desmond Llewelyn still shines as ""Q"" berating 007 for his behaviour and telling him to ""grow up.""Famke Janssen is a throw-back to the good old days of Bond badgirls as the aptly named Xenia Onatopp. Izabella Scorupco however must be the most beautiful of all the ""good"" Bond girls. Feminine to the core and everything the average man would want to love and protect she is is simply yummy.....no more so than when she chides 007's cold-war repartee with his Russian counterpart as ""Boys with Toys""  Soo cute!Action was at a premium from the rip-snorting bungee-jump (pre-credits) to the climactic battle atop the communications tower. Everything gelled in this movie to elevate it to amongst the top 5 Bond films...no question! Top dialog, state of the art fx, innuendos on tap and a really first rate villain. Shame none of the later Brosnan outings have come close to this one!8.8 out of 10!"
The Wedding Planner,2001,5.4,Mary Fiore is San Francisco's most successful supplier of romance and glamor. She knows all the tricks. She knows all the rules. But then she breaks the most important rule of all: she falls in love with the groom.,"The Wedding Planner (2001) Directed by Adam Shankman. Written by Pamela Falk and Michael Ellis. Starring Jennifer Lopez, Matthew McConaughey, Bridgette Wilson-Sampras. Running Time: 100 minutes.    PG-13Ah romance! They meet. They fall in love. They are kept apart by circumstances of the plot. And finally, by the time we reach the bottom of our popcorn boxes, they get back together again. Whether it's Gable and Colbert in 1934, or Lopez and McConaughey in 2001, we love romantic comedies. But let's face it, some are better than others (and few are better than Frank Capra's Oscar-winning classic, ""It Happened One Night"").Mary Fiore (Lopez) is a whiz of a wedding planner who seems to be leading the glamorous good life, until you learn that she spends her off hours watching ""Antiques Road Show"" or playing scrabble with her father (Alex Rocco), a first generation Italian. While hurrying across a San Francisco street one day, her Gucci pump gets caught in a grate just as a runaway dumpster hurtles towards her. The white-coated white knight who comes to her rescue is pediatrician Steve Edison (McConaughey), and thus the familiar cycle of the romantic comedy is set in motion. This ""cute meet"" is followed by a cute date, her first in four years (if you can believe that of a Lopez character!). Then, of course, come the complications: He is about to be married and she is the one who has been hired to plan it; and her own marriage is being arranged by her determined dad.In the best romantic comedies, the filmmakers set up interesting and believable barriers for the characters to overcome on their way to the Big Kiss. In this film, the question is: Why they don't just get together right away? The answer: contrived plotting won't let them. One doubts, for example, that a character as smart as Mary would even consider consenting to her father's meddlesome matchmaking.But rather than tell a compelling story, the filmmakers seem satisfied to simply provide an attractive vehicle for the two stars, and to furnish a few good laughs along the way. The attraction of the leads is unquestionable, and that alone has filled theaters with admiring fans. Supporting characters, though not fully developed, provide a full measure of amusement: Joanna Gleason and Charles Kimbrough, rescued from canceled TV shows, are hilarious as the newly rich, tipsy parents of McConaughey 's would-be bride (Wilson-Sampras). The direction of the film is snappy, with accomplished camera work, brisk editing and lively choreography during the forties-style dance scenes. The look of the film is also greatly enhanced by its San Francisco setting.So, if you want to see two of today's good looking stars looking good, see this film. If you want to see an excellent romantic comedy, rent ""It Happened One Night.""Rating: 2 stars out of 4###"
My Blueberry Nights,2007,6.6,A young lonely woman takes a soul-searching journey across America to resolve her questions about love while encountering a series of off-beat characters along the way.,"Wong Kar Wai's English-language debut is a home run, thanks to his superior craft and thanks to the remarkable group of individuals he has brought together, from his star-studded cast to Ry Cooder on lead guitar and Darius Khondji as director of photography. Khondji is the lonesome lens man who made Pollack, Allen, Fincher, Boyle, Polanski, and Bertolucci look so fine, and he is at the top of his game as he makes Wong Kar Wai's trademark layered look shine like never before. Singer-songwriter Norah Jones' acting debut is impressive, as is Rachel Weisz' performance in the part of the Southern Belle, keeping the dialect coaches busy. Natalie Portman, cast against type, may be the prettiest face in Hollywood, but she tries very hard and, predictably, fails to come across as a trashy gambler. She even slips out of her fake accent twice: Once when she wakes up in bed with Norah Jones (understandable) and again when they split (""You're hopeless""). Similarly, Jude Law is unconvincing in the part of the philosophical bartender. I know everybody loves him, but I just don't see what they see. My money is on David Strathairn and his touching portrayal of Arnie, the quiet drunk. I wish they had kept his tab open a little longer and cut the lame Las Vegas leg of the script."
The World Is Not Enough,1999,6.4,"James Bond uncovers a nuclear plot while protecting an oil heiress from her former kidnapper, an international terrorist who can't feel pain.","I first saw this in the early 2k on cable tv.Revisited it recently.This is the nineteenth in the Bond series and the third to star Pierce Brosnan as James Bond.In this one Bond is assigned to protect an oil tycoon's daughter who had previously been held for ransom by an ex KGB turned terrorist. During this assignment, Bond unravels a scheme to increase petroleum prices by triggering a nuclear meltdown in the waters of Istanbul.This one has an amazing pre credit scene (not the lousy window jump sequence). The boat chase sequence is amazeballs.The villain, Reynard, is truly sinister n Carlyle did a fine job but his character ain't developed well.The story ain't engrossing n none of the henchmen is memorable.This time Bond faces Reynard who is hell bent on causing chaos n destruction.Bond faces many henchmen, Gabor, Mr. Bullion, etc. But the most noteworthy is the attractive cigar girl (Giulietta da Vinci).Bond gets to cool off with Serena Scott Thomas, Denise Richards and Sophie Marceau.Some info on Reynard:
His real name was Victor Zokas n his childhood was particularly traumatic as he was raised in poverty.At the age of fourteen, he ran away from home and joined the Soviet Army. Due to his vicious nature n brutal methods, he was given a place in the KGB. Due to his cunning and effectively discrete ways, he got the nickname, ""Renard The Fox"".Aft his expulsion from the KGB due to his evident mental instability, Zokas took ""Renard"" alias and became one of the world's most feared terrorists.It was 009 who shot Reynard in the head n although a doctor was able to save Renard's life, he was unable to extract the bullet from his patient's skull. Due to its retention within his brain matter, Reynard lost most of his senses and pain was never felt by him.This allowed him to push himself much further than the ordinary human limits."
The Last Temptation of Christ,1988,7.5,"The life of Jesus Christ, his journey through life as he faces the struggles all humans do, and his final temptation on the cross.","Has there ever been a more misunderstood film than Martin Scorcese's The Last Temptation Of Christ? Released amid great controversy and accused of being an offensive and unholy film, the truth of the matter is that it is a deeply reverent work which has the courage to ask challenging questions about the pressures and doubts Jesus must have experienced as the appointed Messiah. It also shows the violence of the times in graphic detail. If viewers consider it blasphemous to explore on film the immense burden of duty that Jesus bore through his life, then they are narrow-minded and ignorant. If people feel that to show the brutality and harshness of life in Roman times is tasteless and inappropriate, then they are guilty of glorifying difficult but factual truths. There is NOTHING offensive about this film. There is, however, much that is challenging.Jesus (Willem Dafoe), an honest carpenter, saves Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey) from a stoning. Already dimly aware that he is destined to lead an extraordinary life, he soon finds himself being drawn into the role of a religious figurehead. But Jesus finds it hard to accept that he is a Messiah, and as his reputation and following grows he constantly questions if he is a strong enough man to handle the burden of being God's son. After isolating himself in the desert, where he experiences several hallucinations in which he is confronted by visual manifestations of good and evil, Jesus finally concludes that he IS the true son of God and whole-heartedly sets about imparting his love and wisdom to all who'll listen. Later betrayed to the disgruntled Romans by his friend Judas Iscariot (Harvey Keitel), Jesus is crucified. While on the cross, he imagines what his life would have turned out like if he had shied away from his duty as the Messiah and lived life like a mere mortal.It is this final section of the film that has provoked the most vociferous outrage. The sequence shows Jesus as he slowly dies on the cross, dreaming of an alternative life in which he sins and copulates and hates like all normal people. Many people have criticised the film on the grounds that these scenes are blasphemous. Such claims are nonsense - the film is not saying that Jesus was a sinner, nor that he gave in to temptation of the flesh, nor still that he was a man filled with hate. The film is merely saying that, in such great pain and so close to death while still just a young man, he might - just maybe - have wondered if it was all worth it. At the end of the film, we see Jesus accept his role knowing that his death is the ultimate act of unselfish love, so the film actually is totally in agreement with what all Christians believe. If the film had come to the conclusion that Jesus's whole life was a waste, his death too, then maybe the detractors would've had cause to complain. But how can they possibly be offended by the film as it stands? For goodness sake, it's a film about absolute faith!!! In truth, The Last Temptation Of Christ is an excellent movie. Compellingly acted, beautifully shot on Moroccan locations, and full of telling ideas, it is a work of real depth and power. The accents are sometimes distracting and some of the dialogue occasionally betrays ill-suited modernisms, but apart from these minor drawbacks it is one of the most important and thought-provoking films ever made."
Pak de poen en smeer 'm,1969,7.2,The life and times of inept bank robber Virgil Starkwell.,"The clumsy Virgil Starkwell (Woody Allen) is bullied when he is a child. Then he decides to play cello, but without musical talent, the loser joins a street gang and ends in prison. When he escapes, he meets the laundry worker Louise (Janet Margolin) and lies to her, telling that he plays cello in the symphonic orchestra.He is arrested in a hold up and Louise finds him in prison. He breaks out and flees with Louise to another state. He tries to be honest but he is incapable to fit in any job. When he finally finds a job position suitable for his intellect, he is blackmailed by a colleague and returns to his criminal life. But his heists are disastrous and he always ends in prison.""Take the Money and Run"" is the second film by Woody Allen in a documentary style the same way he does with ""Zelig"" in 1983, and tells the saga of a clumsy smalltime thief. The last time I had seen this film was on 22 August 1999 and this time I found it still enjoyable, but less than the last time.Virgil Starkwell is an incompetent loser obsessed with bank heists. The narrative and interviews in the documentary style of the 60's and 70's have hilarious moments and is closed by the funny interview of his neighbor that asks to the interviewer how an imbecile like Virgil could plan the heist of banks. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Um Assaltante Bem Trapalh√£o"" (""A Very Clumsy Thief"")"
Ender's Game,2013,6.6,"Young Ender Wiggin is recruited by the International Military to lead the fight against the Formics, an insectoid alien race who had previously tried to invade Earth and had inflicted heavy losses on humankind.","The box-office failure of big budget (110m$) book adaptation 'Ender's Game' doesn't bode well for the future of my favorite movie genre. Writer Orson Scott Card has had many offers since the book release in 1985 to turn it into a film. He rejected many of them because of creative differences and because most Studios insisted on making Ender older (in the book he's 6 to 10 years old). There were plans in 2003 by Warner Brothers to let Wolfgang Petersen have a go at it with a script written by Card himself. Card's script was a fusion of 'Ender's Game' and 'Ender's Shadow'. In 2010 Gavin Hood got attached as director and screenwriter and the script became based on the first book again with plans to make it into a franchise or a TV series if successful. Unfortunately EG made only 112m$ worldwide (although it opened first place in the US with 27m$) so all future plans have been put on ice. It's really a shame because as far as science fiction flicks go this really is one of the better ones. The VFX were done by Digital Domain who also co-financed the film and they look absolutely stunning. This film will a good 4K showcase Blu-ray when they finalize the format at the end of 2014. The film follows the book quite closely but because of the time constraints of the film medium a lot of events had to be compressed and some subplots where eliminated. 113 mins really is too short, an extra 40 mins or so would have let more room to expand on Ender's training etc. Altogether I think most fans of the book will be happy with the end result but it it just lacks the depth the book had to offer. So hopefully they make a 3 hour extended version (depending on how much material they shot) on BD to give the story more time to breathe."
Richie Rich,1994,5.4,"Richie Rich is the richest kid in the world. The one thing Richie doesn't have is friends. When his parents suddenly go missing, Richie hooks up with a group of kids who just might fill the void in his life, while helping save his folks.","This is definitely teen fare, but it's very entertaining which means adults would get a lot of laughs out of it. As with any comedy, some of the stuff is really stupid and some of it is really funny. Along the way, you get some of modern Hollywood's secular plugs and a few swear words that you wouldn't want your little ones to hear, but overall, I have little to criticize with this one.There were a number of sight gags, things that made me laugh out loud, such as dollar signs instead of spots on the dog, the dress-ware of the little rich kid (Macauley Culkin), the eccentric characters - good and bad guys - are all fun to watch.I thought Jonathan Hyde, as the butler, stole the show."
The Living Daylights,1987,6.7,"James Bond is sent to investigate a KGB policy to kill all enemy spies, and uncovers an arms deal that potentially has major global ramifications.","An underrated film in the series. Timothy Dalton particularly changed the Bond character to make it more faithful to Fleming's books. Instead of being a suave playboy, he's a burnt-out assassin. His Bond is a palpable thread to his enemies and was far more energetic than past actors in the role. This means less philandering and more mission. Unfortunately, the ""Bond girl"" (Kara Milovy) and the villains didn't have memorable performances. With a better cast, this would've been a possible contender for the best film in the series.The plot in this movie is different from past Bonds. There's no world domination or global destruction. Rather it's a plot of Soviet defection and people conspiring together to commit treason. It's a welcome change to the formula not knowing exactly what's going to happen next. In the 2nd half, there's a big set piece of Bond on an airplane (in the midst of a war) that's one of the most ambitious action scenes in the series.Despite not being one of the better known Bond films, it was a very important one for the franchise. It pushed the series toward storytelling, action and established Bond as a more dark gritty character. The later films since then have not turned back."
Richie Rich's Christmas Wish,,4.1,"After getting blamed for spoiling Christmas, the richest kid in the world wishes he'd never been born.","Richie Rich'$ Christmas WishYou would think that being bitten by a radioactive $100 bill would be the basis of an affluent comic book character.However, the only power the world's richest kid in this family-comedy possesses is that of financial persuasion.After his envious cousin Reggie Van Dough (Jake Richardson) sabotages Richie Rich (David Gallagher) and his butler Cadbury's (Keene Curtis) sleigh, and slanders him around town, Richie uses a wish machine - cooked up by one of his scientists - to wish he'd never been born.Trapped in a world where Reggie is now the richest and meanest kid in the world, Richie races to obtain the dinosaur fossil that will fuel this alternate realities disengaged wishing machine.With a story that borrows heavily from superior seasonal fare and a cast of no names replacing the noteworthy originals, Richie Rich'$ Christmas Wish is bankrupt.As for my Christmas wish: no Christmas until December 1.

Dr. Dolittle,1998,5.4,A doctor discovers that he can communicate with animals.,"Doctor Dolittle (1998)I was surprised to see this movie got such a low rating‚Äîit's not so bad. Oh, for sure it's not so great, either. But Eddie Murphy alone makes it something worth watching (he's one of the few perfect-pitch comedians out there). And the story, a 1920 classic for children, is something of its own.What falls apart is the slightly pushy sentimentalism and the generally mediocre secondary cast. That might be enough to push it into mediocrity, for sure, but it's not meant to be a deep classic, and it plays with the story nicely.That story is not just about a doctor (of the human type) who can hear animals talking. It's more about how society condemns hims and tries to help him with psycho-care. His bland wife (with the gorgeous eyes that get overplayed) is typical of his ""friends,"" all nice people with distractions and no time for the possibility that he might, in fact, hear animals talk.The talking animals are of course great fun, from the rats to the tiger. This is the part of the movie that is meant to appeal across the board, and it does, including its good special effects. The feeling of family, not dysfunctional, is another bit of warmth, not to mention that the family is African American, a nice twist on the original story based on an English doctor.And though the movie was not liked by critics, it has made a third of a billion dollars, which speaks for itself. Not a masterpiece, and not even a classic, it still has wonderful aspects including a very wonderful basic concept."
My Girl,1991,6.9,"Vada is obsessed with death. Her mother is dead, and her father runs a funeral parlor. When Vada's father hires Shelly, a makeup expert, and begins to fall in love, Vada is outraged and does everything in her power to split them up.","It's 1972 in small town Madison, Penn. Tomboy Vada Sultenfuss (Anna Chlumsky) has Thomas J (Macaulay Culkin) as her best friend. She lives with her father (Dan Aykroyd) and grandmother in their funeral parlor home. One day, Shelly DeVoto (Jamie Lee Curtis) answers an ad to do makeup for the funeral home.Anna Chlumsky and Macaulay Culkin couldn't be any more cuter. Anna gets to have some great funny one liners. It is possibly one of the best sweetest coming-of-age story. The romance between Dan Aykroyd and Jamie Lee Curtis is also lovely. I love the bumper car scene. There is probably way too many spoilers. I guess people were afraid to be shocked. The movie handles the death with class. Don't be scared off even for the kids. It's a great movie."
Roman Holiday,1953,8.0,A bored and sheltered princess escapes her guardians and falls in love with an American newsman in Rome.,"Audrey Hepburn simply dazzles in this gem of a movie. Princess Ann (Hepburn) escapes the confines of her rarefied royal existence for a day, to be rescued by a reporter, Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck).Bradley senses a scoop and seeks to inveigle the Princess into a story. However, this is a fairy tale, of the Princess and the commoner. Love blossoms, the beautiful Princess experiencing everyday things we might take for granted with a delight we cannot know. Sitting at a roadside caf√©, getting a haircut, enjoying an ice cream, dancing on a riverboat. She soaks in these experiences in the company of her handsome saviour, not realising his intentions.It's beautifully done. Hepburn is radiant, refined, beautiful, enchanting - things she went on to display in many movies. However, she was at her most perfect here, as the beautiful Princess needing love and wanting happiness. Peck is an ideal foil. Tall, dark, and handsome, his only thought being the scoop placed before him, his ambition wilting in the face of his developing love for a Princess he can't hope to attain. Both are ably supported by Eddie Albert as Irving Radovich, Bradley's photographer colleague. Indeed, Albert is involved in many of the funniest scenes.It's a fairy tale, beautifully told. William Wyler makes the most of his location, showing us Rome in all it's splendour. The perfect backdrop to the perfect fairy tale.However, this film belongs to Audrey Hepburn. She shines and dazzles, brightening nearly two hours of every viewers life. How could you hope for more than that."
Uncle Buck,1989,7.1,Laid back commitment-phobe Buck babysits his brother's rebellious teenage daughter and her cute younger brother and sister.,"There isn't really much to be said about Uncle Buck. It is very good but it is a simple little film, one of those nice films to watch on a Sunday afternoon without having to rack your brain or think too hard.The late John Candy excels here as Buck Russell who at first glance is a slob and without much going for him. However, as the film goes on, we learn that Uncle Buck does indeed have a heart. The film really is about a guy who looks like the type of man you would keep your family away from but who is in fact a guy with a heart of gold.I recommend Uncle Buck to anyone who fancies watching a nice simple little film for the whole family to enjoy. And watch out for the scene with the drunken clown on the doorstep!"
The Jackal,1997,6.4,"An imprisoned I.R.A. fighter is freed to help stop a brutal, seemingly ""faceless"" assassin from completing his next job.","Comparing this movie with the original film, The Day of the Jackal (1973), from which this was adapted, I would say this new version is just okay.  The original film is simply extraordinary and if you haven't seen it, I sincerely recommend that you do it today and compare by yourself."
Waterspin wonderspin,,7.6,,"Vizip√≥k csodap√≥k (could be roughly translated as: water spider-wonder spider)has originally been made as a TV series, and this version is a full feature movie, chopped together from some of the episodes. This one tells the story of a year of the main character, the water spider (not a very realistic one, but yet even more characteristic), from spring to the end of autumn. through this time he discovers the life in the lake makes new friends, builds his own castle from web, and air-bubbles, and when winter comes nearer, and the water gets cold he comes out from the lake, back to an empty snail-shell, for a winters-sleep. This cartoon displays the flora and fauna of the lake and shore with an ecologist's profoundness. After watching it you get to know many interesting things about the ecosystem there. And the top of that its a beautifully made, and very entertaining movie. Our water-spider always gets himself into new adventures, meets new creature of the deep, but the best is when he's just chatting with his conformist neighbors: the water snails, or his best friend ever, the moody cruciferous spider (I don't know how you call it), who lives by the shore. Anyway, the very best thing about it, is its completeness. The film ends the same way it starts, it comes a full circle, and at the end the main character realizes it too, and we all come to the idea, that in nature there's always a start over, its never the end."
Grease,1978,7.2,"Good girl Sandy Olsson and greaser Danny Zuko fell in love over the summer. When they unexpectedly discover they're now in the same high school, will they be able to rekindle their romance?","This movie is such a classic musical and movie in general. The songs are so catchy and well known. Olivia and John made this movie as good as it is. But overall I wanted to do this review in tribute to Olivia, she put up a good fight but left too soon:(. She was only 73 and left us just yesterday. She left an everlasting impact on females, people and especially Australians. As an Australian she truly is an icon. RIP Dame Olivia Newton John."
The Dreamers,2003,7.1,A young American studying in Paris in 1968 strikes up a friendship with a French brother and sister. Set against the background of the '68 Paris student riots.,"Paris, May 1968. Revolution breaks out and the world seems to be in a critical turning point, but inside the four walls of an apartment, three youngsters experience their very own revolution.Yes, it's true. In the year 2004, one of the best cinematic experiences is offered by Bertolucci. Many are those who'd thought that he had nothing more to give, but with THE DREAMERS, the creator is reborn and next to his heroes he witnesses again the passage from adolescence and innocence to the age of responsibilities. A great fan of cinema himself, he doesn't hesitate to pay a number of tributes, just like Godard used to do in the past and Tarantino very recently. As he puts his view into the eyes of his protagonists, the girl and the boys seem to live inside the movies they adore. They're playing with lines from known films, they imitate characters, they put themselves into the sequences they love.Despite their young age, all three actors not only do they show that they're worth of starring in a Bertolucci film, but they also go even further giving in every scene the necessary vividness and realistic tension. Ignoring the cosmogony taking place in the streets, they surrender to their own cosmogonic changes, to the wild sexual awakening, to the game between friendship and love, pleasure and pain. Eventually they commit themselves to the struggle between the game itself and real life. And that's where the heroes violently return in the thrilling final sequences in order to face their duty towards history.THE DREAMERS is by far one the best motion pictures of the year, so daring but at the same time so energetic that seems able to touch anyone as a pure and romantic confession of a great filmmaker."
Dr. Dolittle 2,2001,4.8,Dolittle must save a forest and a bear's life.,"If you like these kind of movies, then its funny.  My wife loves these kinds of movie, and enjoyed this.  Its amazing how well they can train bears, some of the stunts are incredible.  The voice overs couldn't be done better.  My opinion of the film is its cute, but not many surprises in this one.  I laughed at this film, and comedy is the hardest thing to do, but I did not find this better the average comedy.  Its funny, but not p**s your pants funny."
Mercury Rising,1998,6.1,Shadowy elements in the NSA target a nine-year old autistic savant for death when he is able to decipher a top secret code.,"Not a very great movie, but it's entertaining and keeps the interest, despite its flaws which aren't that few. But still it deserves a positive feedback from me and I guess my rating is fair.Even though this is another Bruce Willis's action-flick, at least this one isn't excessive on that matter, it has a story: Bruce Willis portrays Art, an FBI agent who protects Simon, a boy who is 9 years old and is autistic. Some criminals want to silence the boy after he deciphered a super-difficult code named ""Mercury"" and Art's mission is to make sure he doesn't get assassinated.Since the movie is mostly about the FBI agent and the autistic boy and their chemistry, there should be more touching moments. But at least the ending has a tender scene when Simon hugs Art.Bruce Willis won the 1999 Golden Raspberry for his performance. Well, his acting may be nothing special, but certainly not deserving of a Golden Raspberry on this one.On the other hand, Miko Hughes won the category of Best Performance in a Feature Film - Leading Young Actor at the 1999 Young Artist Awards. A very deserved tribute, his acting as Simon is superb (a difficult role for a child, which he masterfully portrays). I think he should have won an Oscar for Best Child Actor. Why does it always have to be the adults winning Oscars? Why can't children win them too?"
Spy Game,2001,7.1,Retiring CIA agent Nathan Muir recalls his training of Tom Bishop while working against agency politics to free him from his Chinese captors.,"Spy Game will probably never be considered among the best spy movies to come out of Hollywood, however, it is a really entertaining movie with quite a few surprises.The movie is set in the early 1990's. Nathan Muir (Redford) is a retiring CIA officer who learns that his former prot√©g√© Tom Bishop (Pitt) has been captured while attempting a prison rescue in China and will be executed shortly. CIA brass want to know what motivated Bishop to attempt this unauthorized action and they interview Muir to find out. Muir tells the story of how he met and trained Bishop: from Vietnam to Berlin to Beirut. While Muir is setting the background, he is also working secretly behind the scenes to free Bishop. Will Muir's cloak and dagger antics be discovered before he has a chance to free Bishop? Overall the movie is not as good as other spy genre films such as Three Days of the Condor, Spy Who Came in From the Cold, or Hunt for Red October. I think Redford does well in the role of the retiring, slightly jaded CIA officer Muir. Pitt does well with what he's given, though I think his character suffers from poor writing, especially near the end of the film. Think of Spy Game as a more sophisticated Mission: Impossible (that's no knock on M:I) and you'll be pleasantly surprised."
Zookeeper,2011,5.2,"A group of zoo animals decide to break their code of silence in order to help their lovable zookeeper find love, without opting to leave his current job for something more illustrious.","Director Frank Coraci seemed to have dumbed down his filmography, bring responsible for comedies like The Wedding Singer, The Waterboy and Click, all starring Adam Sandler, to relative duds like Around the World in 80 Days, and somehow Zookeeper straddles closer to being much of a miss, though it follows the standard formulaic procedure of a romantic comedy where the guy tries ever so hard to woo that girl of his dreams, only that the girl, well, is seriously not worth it.Kevin James once again plays a self deprecating role as Griffin Keyes the titular zookeeper, and opens the film with a disastrous proposal to his girlfriend Stephanie (Leslie Bibb) who rejects him outright because of his profession. How anyone can do that is beyond me, because it's not as if it's the first day of knowing that fella, but so it goes, and painted the picture of someone after wealth and status, which according to Griffin's soon to be married brother Dave (Nat Faxon) is something a woman like Stephanie would prefer. A job offer at his brother's exotic car showroom would mean Griffin leaving a job that is his calling, and the animals of the zoo have to plot to ensure Griffin stays to care for them.And that meant an accidental revelation that they can all speak English, fluently, and possess a keen sense of humour, sort of, spending plenty of time bickering than to come up with concrete plans to help our protagonist, and even then, offer tips more suited for the animal world, which allows for some pretty awkward moments, though firmly kept in family friendly territory. In some ways it's similar to Night at the Museum, with the museum pieces coming alive at night, and in the same vein, the animals gather in town hall like fashion when the last patron and caretaker leave the premises to partake in some idle chatter.Voiced by recognizable folks such as Nick Nolte as the emo Gorilla Bernie who might be more suited in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Adam Sandler as Donald the Monkey Sylvester Stallone as Joe the Lion who fantasizes about being king of the jungle, Cher as the Lioness, Jon Favreau and Faizon Lowe as a pair of Bears, and Maya Rudolph as Mollie the Girraffe, and a whole host of other voices, you'd come to expect that there would be at least some wisecracking animals to liven up the mood and add to the sporadic laughter caused from a rather tired narrative, but tough luck, there was too little of that.Instead, what we got are the usual rote narrative development where Griffin painfully tries so hard to regain the affections of someone so undeserving and shallow, though some may argue it's natural selection like in the Animal Kingdom where the mate will choose from the strongest of her suitors, with Griffin being in competition with yet another braggart ex- boyfriend (Joe Rogan) of Stephanie's. In some ways it touches upon contemporary strategies usually involving another hot woman, and Griffin's choice to induce jealousy is that of his fellow zoo co-worker Kate (Rosario Dawson), whom you can stay 10 steps ahead to know how what should be role-playing, would turn out to be.With an ensemble such as the underused Ken Jeong as Venom the reptile house zookeeper and Donnie Wahlberg as the token keeper with a sadistic streak, both of whom should have seen more screen time, Zookeeper is what you would label as an average family entertainer, playing it very safe just like how one would view a zoo exhibit, encased behind a rigid structure that provides plenty of the same, and none of the surprises."
Swing,2014,6.0,"Three women from three generations are forced together, mentored by an old diva and a transvestite, to form a band. They are successful on stage, but off of it they are not getting along at all.",FeaturesNapf√©ny a j√©gen(1961)
Anna Karenina,2012,6.6,"In late-19th-century Russian high society, St. Petersburg aristocrat Anna Karenina enters into a life-changing affair with the dashing Count Alexei Vronsky.","Good production but doesn't quite hit the spot.Set in 19th century Russia, a married aristocrat, Anna Karenina (played by Keira Knightley), starts an affair with a Count. After a while, the relationship becomes quite serious...A decent adaptation of the Tolstoy novel. Lavish costumes and sets, and a sense of the emptiness and superficiality of Russian aristocracy. However, for all its intrigues, just doesn't quite hit the spot. Not entirely engaging and seems to drag in segments. Some of the imagery was just to clever for its own good, ending up feeling pretentious.Solid performances all round. Jude Law is the best of the lot, as the conservative husband of Anna Karenina."
Deconstructing Harry,1997,7.3,"Suffering from writer's block and eagerly awaiting his writing award, Harry Block remembers events from his past and scenes from his best-selling books as characters, real and fictional, come back to haunt him.","Harry Block is a writer who tends to thinly veil his won life in his art. His tendency to mock his friends and family through similar characters in his work has left him with three ex-wives and a huge number of people who hate him.  He lives a lonely life and has a penchant for pills and whore (prostitution being pure and totally free of BS).  When his college plans to honour him he finds he has no-one who wants to go with him, so he ¬ëkidnaps' his son, a black whore and an old friend with him.  As the characters from his work come and go around him, he finds that he struggles to make amends with those around him and decides than he can only be happy in his work.This is a fantastic Woody Allen film, and his only film to be rated 18 in the UK.  The story seems to be a very clear, very personal attack on himself.  It's like Allen is using a fictional story (going to be honoured by his college) to lay himself bare.  Certainly Block's habit for using his own life in his work seems to echo accusations towards Allen in real life. At times this makes the film really hard to watch, some scenes are so full of apparent self-loathing and bile that it's hard to laugh.  Happily the film is hilarious all the way through - this is not one of Allen's arty, serious films.  It should be said that Allen denies that this is as personal as it appears but it is easy to see why it is seen as a personal attack on himself.The film's main story is littered with scenes from Block's work that demonstrate how he has used his characters to mock others and to portray himself - Robin Williams is the best as the artist that literally lacks focus and Crystal is hellishly good.  The story's moral about art and life is not as clear or as clever as it thinks it is, but it's very, very funny and the level of bile Allen appears to be spitting at himself is very interesting to observe.Allen is great in the central role, but you do occasionally feel like you should look away at times because he appears to be giving himself a real kicking.  The rest of the cast is really good and is full of famous faces ranging from big stars (Moore, Crystal, Alley, Williams) to familiar faces (Maguire, Bogosian, Louis-Dreyfus, Shue, Tucci).  As a director Allen does some new tricks to make this feel even more different from his other films, but the jump cuts etc are a little tiresome.  The most important character to me is Cookie.  She is significant because Allen has not really ever created a good black character (even if she is a prostitute).Overall this is a really funny film.  The degree of vitriol that Allen appears to aim towards himself makes this a little less enjoyable but overall it is a great film."
Pleasantville,1998,7.5,"Two 1990s teenage siblings find themselves transported to a 1950s sitcom where their influence begins to profoundly change that colorless, complacent world.","Pleasantville should be nominated for Best Director and Best Cinematography, and perhaps Best Supporting Actor for William H. Macy. Joan Allen, Jeff Daniels and Tobey Maguire are also excellent, and the idea is brilliant. In other words, this film is one of the best of the year. It is fun for the eyes and filled with wonderful allusions to great books and other films, not to mention some similar events in our country's past. If you will let yourself go from reality and put a little thought into it, you will realize the sheer genius behind this film. The messages were plenty and appropriate, and while it is extremely fun to watch, it still is able to evoke deeper emotions. Fantastic, and my vote for second best film of the year behind Saving Private Ryan."
Look Who's Talking,1989,5.9,"After a single, career-minded woman is left on her own to give birth to the child of a married man, she finds a new romantic chance in a cab driver. Meanwhile, the point-of-view of the newborn baby is narrated through voice-over.",John Travolta is very charming in this film.The chemistry between John and Kristie is fabulous. They both look great together. The director captures the best expressions of the baby.. Bruce Willis does well with the voice over. A nice feel good film
The Illusionist,2006,7.5,"In turn-of-the-century Vienna, a magician uses his abilities to secure the love of a woman far above his social standing.","Kind of a strange movie but very original and entertaining! It was a Gothic-romance period-piece drama-mystery, and quirky characters and a bizarre--or at least unusual--plot held my interest.Edward Norton's character plays an inscrutable but romantic master illusionist. But is he just a master illusionist or has he developed powers to effect the creepy conjuring of those who have passed on? (Regardless, the guy is so easy on the eyes.)Jessica Biel is beautiful and good in her role but I couldn't help thinking, ""Hey, Jessica, Scarlett Johanssen called. She wants her lips back.""Paul Giamatti bothered me just a tad at first because he spoke in a near-whisper and had a scruffy beard so you couldn't read his lips. He got louder and his character developed pretty darned well, thank goodness. Actually, he was fantastic (so what else is new?).The makers of this movie did the same thing the makers of Little Miss Sunshine did--made me want to see the film twice, but for different reasons: LMS because the first time I saw it, I laughed so hard I cried, and I really needed a laugh again (and got it); The Illusionist because I was like the audience for the title character's shows the first time I saw it--just kind of naive and awed and staring up at the action with my mouth hanging open. So I'll have to see it again and pay attention. Kind of like when my daughter told me to go see The Sixth Sense again and pay attention to what Bruce Willis's character was wearing. (Plot-wise, this is unrelated, folks--just a movie watcher's analogy.)At first, the old-fashioned circle wipes seemed a little distracting, but in retrospect, they were part of the excellent movie-making decisions that created the illusion of time and place in this film. A really good story with really good art direction and really good actors, costumes and settings. Definitely worth a go-see--or two!"
La double vie de V√©ronique,1991,7.6,"Two parallel stories about two identical women; one living in Poland, the other in France. They don't know each other, but their lives are nevertheless profoundly connected.","Only a few of the previous comments on this movie has mentioned the use of music. Just like in Trois Couleurs Bleu, the music of La Double vie de V√©ronique is very indivisible from the film: the visual and the auditive form a united whole and also elements of it are directly part of the story. And when it comes to music made for film, Zbigniew Preisner's powerful score for this one is as good as it gets.When there is little dialogue, it is not just the images and expressions on Ir√®ne Jacob's face that tells the story, but also the powerful strains of music intermingled with it.Even with just these elements in place, it would be a movie worth seeing, though obviously a narrative based in little extent on dialogue and with less emphasis on a clear-cut story than your average American movie is unfortunately lost on some of the earlier commentators.And even this seemingly sparingly laid out narrative reveals itself to the careful watcher to be a rich tapestry of symbols, metaphors and hidden meanings. Ki√©slowski, just as in his other movies, demands participation of the viewer, and the one who expects passive entertainment has found the wrong film to watch.Krzysztof never liked discussing meaning when it came to his movies, but liked keeping that up to the viewers, and few other directors have ever been able to lay out more food for thought and fruitful interpretation than him.I saw the Three Colours trilogy before seeing V√©ronique, and the many similarities, both musical and in visual narrative, makes it feel like it almost belongs together with those three to form a quartet. In some ways it has more in common with Blue than Red and White do.Had Juliette Binoche also been cast in the role of V√©ronique, as I understand that Krzysztof originally had intended, the similarities had been even greater. She was, however, occupied with shooting Les Amants du Pont-Neuf at the time I believe, and so Krzysztof opted for the less experienced Ir√®ne. I don't think the film is any worse for it: she is brilliant, and not just a pretty face as some people put it, but a very intelligent and aware actress as anyone who has seen her interview for the Red DVD release should discover if they haven't already.In short: a wonderful film, wonderful music, great acting. But not a movie for everyone."
The Patriot,2000,7.2,Peaceful farmer Benjamin Martin is driven to lead the Colonial Militia during the American Revolution when a sadistic British officer murders his son.,"The Patriot is NOT a documentary. It didn't pretend to be, and wasn't. Loosely based upon Francis Marion (the ""Swamp Fox""), it only touched on Marion's impact on the Revolution in South Carolina. If anything, it was downplayed. For instance, in real life, he had over 150 men in his guerrilla band. The movie portrayed him as having far fewer. As a documentary, it fails on this and many other points. As a movie, it is a tremendous success.As far as visuals, they were stunning. The wide-open vistas and battle scenes were breath-taking and beautifully filmed. Yes, it was violent, but that lent a realism to the film that most other films about this era lack. The look and feel of this period was portrayed well.The acting was superb. I won't give anything away, but this did NOT (arguably) have either an entirely ""Hollywood"" plot ‚Äì people, including civilians, DIE, as they do in war ‚Äì or much of a ""Hollywood"" ending, despite a relatively happy one. That was impressive, and made the film genuine, exciting and at times, shocking. Plot points such as Benjamin Martin's youngest daughter's feelings about her daddy, and the romance between his son and a young girl were touching, and even emotional.I found some things complain about. Crisp, clean, brand-new Colonial American flags suddenly appear after, and during, the final battle. In reality they would have been rags by then ‚Äì or at least not so clean. One bad bit of dialogue: Benjamin Martin is on the beach with his sister-in- law, and he asks if he can sit down. Her reply, ""It's a free country ‚Äì or will be soon,"" was a 20th century throw-away line dressed up with a 1780 caveat, and I cringed at it.The film was historically accurate in many respects. The formal way of speaking, plus the family-above-all, loyalty-to-The-Cause attitudes expressed throughout, were genuine, even though both are out of favor today. Children using weapons, and going off to fight on a moment's notice, was not an uncommon story, and supposedly happened in a branch of my own family. Relationships like Martin's and his wife's sister did occur, often out of necessity. I was surprised to read afterwards that the battle tactics of the last scene occurred, almost exactly as shown, at the Battle of Cowpens, including fierce hand-to-hand combat. Colonel Banastre Tarleton ‚Äì the basis for the movie's character William Tavington ‚Äì was indeed seen as a war criminal by American colonists at the time, and the real Tarleton even had a horse shot out from under him!But was it biased? Sure it was. Roughly a third of the American colonists were Loyalists, another third were ""rebels"", and another third were undecided. It would have made the story more complete and complex to portray this (or the time Tarleton mistakenly slaughtered some of those very Loyalists!) But I've read a poem online (""Ode to Valour"") dedicated to Col. Banastre Tarleton's ""heroic exploits"" that would shame modern-day propagandists.I think we all accept that not every British officer of this era was a monster. In fact, in the movie ‚Äì as in real life - Cornwallis and other British officers were appalled that the ""Ghost""/Swamp Fox did not play by the rules of ""civilized warfare"", and chastised characters like Tavington who also breached them. The real Swamp Fox knew a bit about balance, however. After after the war, when the real Francis Marion served in the South Carolina Senate, he is said to have advocated a lenient policy toward the Loyalists. The real Tarleton survived the war, went home to write his memoirs, was seen as a hero, and was elected to Parliament. Maybe we need a sequel to cover all of these other aspects of the story. Until then, this one is a must- see."
Horrible Bosses 2,2014,6.3,"Dale, Kurt and Nick decide to start their own business but things don't go as planned because of a slick investor, prompting the trio to pull off a harebrained and misguided kidnapping scheme.","A continuation of the Horrible Bosses series, this second in the series hits a bit more about the complexity of striking out on your own. The three amigos in Nick Hendricks, Kurt Buckman, and Dale Arbus take a risk in establishing their brand of shower heads and seek a stake in the business world. What they discover is that is much more of doggie dog world than they expected. Has a large well known cast from Kevin Spacey, Jaimie Foxx, and Christoph Waltz. Jennifer Aniston is the nastiest I have seen in this film and does push the cougar sex craze angel to the limits. As the trio strike out on their own, they soon discover they need plan b if they want to be able to compete in the world of business. This plan B is not perfect but helps them find a path to being their own bosses."
Little Miss Sunshine,2006,7.8,A family determined to get their young daughter into the finals of a beauty pageant take a cross-country trip in their VW bus.,"It's a big risk when you base your movie around a child. Nine times out of ten it will end in an annoying disaster. The likes of 'Home Alone' are the exception. 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a rare case of getting it oh so right. Abigail Breslin was fantastic in this movie.Sure she has an amazing cast of adults around her. But in a way that only makes her performance even more impressive. She is not only holding court with them, she is often showing them up and stealing scenes.There's a tremendous balance of uplifting and heavy material in this movie. It's a feel-good, but it isn't afraid to pull at the heart-strings either. Very few movies find the intricate balance between these two gears as well as this movie does.It's taken me 16 years to finally see this movie but I'm glad I finally did. It is a treasure. 9/10."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,2003,7.5,"During the Napoleonic Wars, a brash British captain pushes his ship and crew to their limits in pursuit of a formidable French war vessel around South America.","There is a scene in MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD where the captain of a British Naval ship, circa 1805, debates the difference between duty and passion. Having passed on an opportunity to make wonderful new discoveries in favor of the pursuit of a massive French war ship, the scene manages to make a rather eloquent, yet subtle comment on the nature of man and his place within the world. The beauty of this film is that there are many such moments where the viewer is simultaneously bombarded with thematic musings, exciting action sequences, great acting and historical accuracy to the point where it becomes difficult to take it all in at once.Those of you looking for something more like Pirates of the Caribbean will be disappointed as this film is short on action and long on character development. There are only two major battle sequences, separated by more than an hour and a half of time. And while they are great; violently realistic and dramatically involving, the real guts of this film lies in the human stories told along the way. The director, Peter Weir, highlights his ability to tell an intimate story amidst a grand backdrop much like he did in The Truman Show. We get to know these men, their strengths and weaknesses and we see how the long and hard voyage plays on their minds over the film's progression. In one scene, a young officer feels the pressure of his men's dismissive stares and decides to end matters in his own way, afraid of what may be in store for him should he stick it out. Weir does a good job at highlighting the many facets of seafaring life.If you're looking for an intelligent and thought-provoking journey into the life of a 19th Century British Naval Vessell, look no further. Master and Commander has the depth of a good Discovery Channel show and the action worthy of almost any other high-seas adventure that comes to mind."
Die Another Day,2002,6.1,"James Bond is sent to investigate the connection between a North Korean terrorist and a diamond mogul, who is funding the development of an international space weapon.","Look, let's be clear about it...it's the year 2002, not 1962.  This franchise of movies has evolved over the years from a cool and clever spy series to an over-the-top slam bang action series.  When you go to see a James Bond film, you should EXPECT any or all of the following: 1)  A completely unrealistic, contrived plot 2)  Unbelievably cheesy and corny one-liners (almost all of which are sexual in nature) 3)  A supervillain seemingly brilliant and mad enough to quest for world domination, but is somehow stupid enough to let Bond get close enough to spoil the whole thing 4)  A female counterpart (or several) that looks good, gets captured, and ultimately gets saved by our hero 5)  Gadgets, cars, and weapons that do fantastic, unbelievable things 6)  Action sequences and stunts that defy fundamental laws of physics and logicHaving said all of that, and knowing what I knew, I was so excited to see this movie, and I loved it.  Why?  Because I got to escape for a couple of hours in a fantasy-spy world.  Because I've seen the other 19 movies and I got to see what other directions they went with the characters.  Because I love the characters and have gotten to know them over the course of the last 19 movies.  Of course it has its shortcomings (the CG was weak in parts) but it has everything that makes the franchise successful.  It pays homage to the older films while pleasing younger fans with it's incredible action sequences.Like it or not, this is what the series has evolved to.  Personally, I like it, but having seen Dr. No, From Russia With Love, etc, I know that the newer movies don't really appeal to many of the fans of those movies (my dad hates the new movies) because they have completely moved away from reality (not to mention the novels).  So understand that before you go and see this movie.  If you can just sit back and enjoy the ride, you will.  But if you're looking for the magic of 1962 to return, than you might be disappointed.  But I will bet on this...judging by the reaction of the theater I was at, James Bond isn't going away anytime soon.Oh by the way, what's with the comment ""Look out Bond, xXx is taking over."" Huh?  When xXx has 20 successful movies under his belt, then we can start comparing the two."
2 Days in Paris,2007,6.7,"Marion and Jack try to rekindle their relationship by traveling to Paris. They visit Marion's parents, but also meet some of her ex-boyfriends.","Those who can write, direct, act, produce and co edit a film are very rare - indeed non existent. Of course there are a few geniuses like Tommy Lee Jones (Three Burials)who can direct and act but they are few and far between. Julie Delpy alas has none of the qualities as mentioned as is demonstrated in this film.""2 Days In Paris"" is nothing more than a two day old, dogs dinner. To be more generous it is a gab-fest with Delpy doing the gabbing at 5000 words per frame. Put aside the cheap cinematography (what photography I hear you say?) and it is nothing more than third rate Woody Allen film from the 1970's except it's on steroids. Once you have gotten over the swing-cam moving left to right - as if the cameraman had been trained to film tennis tournaments - then you can settle down to watch two boring characters self implode amid some of the weakest location settings ever. To be fair, they do take a one second breather about forty-five minutes into the film. If you are watching it on DVD then is the time to have a break for an hour and get yourself primed with a drink for the rest of the film - you'll need it.This is one of those films that makes one feel like a voyeur at a bus stop. You can hear and see the couple in front of you arguing and you want them to go away because after a while they are plain old annoying. In essence, that is the theme that struggles its way through the film.Has as been said by others, it is riddled with clich√©s and stereotypes. The film and the plot has no vision nor lends itself to giving any insights. One suspects that the crude moments in the film are there only to lift the pointless plot out of the doldrums.It is sad that what had the potential to be a good film has been ruined by Delpy's ego in collaboration with the truly awful acting of the others - except the cat who adapted the minimalist method of acting.I shall be writing to the DVD distributors and asking them if they will include a pack of spaghetti with each DVD. I think it would help to relieve the boredom if people could knit spaghetti while watching. At least they would have something at the end of the film.Note to self: Avoid all Delpy films in the future. Send Delpy a catalogue of vari-focal lenses including wide angle. Who knows?"
Grumpy Old Men,1993,7.0,A lifelong feud between two neighbors since childhood only gets worse when a new female neighbor moves across the street.,"I don't know why, but I recently had Grumpy Old Men stuck in my head, I saw it when I was 8 years old with my grandparents, but I figured that I should watch it again before I would comment on it, since your opinion changes when you grow up. So, I rented both Grumpy Old Men and Grumpier Old Men and I was excited to see a decent rating on IMDb, and I love Walter Matthau, so this was a film to look forward too. Well, I finished it this morning and I have to say that it had it's good laughs along with a very heart warming story for the holidays.John and Max are two former friends turned enemies and have been feuding for a long time, we don't really know why at the beginning of the film. When they see a new neighbor moving in on the street, a very attractive older woman named Ariel. Now the boys have something new to fight over and are competing for her love. But it almost drives them crazy how much they keep playing tricks on each other and can they realize that it's finally time to grow up and act their ages or will they stay as grumpy old men?This was a very charming and lovely movie that could melt anyone's heart and make them laugh at the same time. I really do miss the comedies like this since a lot of films are more aimed for a younger generation, I may be 21, but I need the grown up comedies just as well as the one's for today, we need a balance, you know? But I would highly recommend Grumpy Old Men for a little laugh and a good film to watch for an afternoon.7/10"
Out to Sea,1997,6.1,"A failed gambler, intent on meeting a rich widow, tricks his widowed brother-in-law into boarding a cruise ship as dance hosts.","I found this movie to be quite good. Although some people call this movie the ""Grumpy Old Men And The Sea"" it is hilarious at the right moments and soft at others. Matthau and Lemmon are two great actors and if you like one or both of them, be sure not to miss this film."
The Pianist,2002,8.5,"During WWII, acclaimed Polish musician Wladyslaw faces various struggles as he loses contact with his family. As the situation worsens, he hides in the ruins of Warsaw in order to survive.","Reviewers say 'The Pianist' is a harrowing film depicting Wladyslaw Szpilman's Holocaust survival. Themes of resilience, war brutality, and art's transformative power are central. Adrien Brody's performance is lauded for its emotional depth. The realistic portrayal of the Warsaw Ghetto and Nazi atrocities is noted for historical accuracy. Emotions span despair, fear, hope, and determination. Chopin's music underscores the film's core. Some find Szpilman's portrayal as a passive survivor authentic; others critique it for sentimentality or lack of development. Overall, it's a powerful, unforgettable experience evoking empathy and reflection on war's horrors and human strength."
Snitch,2013,6.4,"A father goes undercover for the DEA in order to free his son, who was imprisoned after being set up in a drug deal.","Another plane journey another film that never appealed to me before but seemed good enough to fill some hours with not much else to do. Based on a true story this film sees a working man getting drawn into a drug sting operation in return for reduced time for his son, who was also innocently drawn into a drug dealing charge. In terms of narrative what we get is fairly events-driven and obvious; characters get put in danger, drug dealers are only marginally less trustworthy than the authorities, families are under stress and so on.As a story it does the job but doesn't deliver anything other than what you expect ‚Äì even without knowing the story you probably already know the story since it does more or less what you think it will. In terms of what happens there are not too many opportunities for set-pieces but the film should be able to really hatchet up the tension given what is at stake. Unfortunately it doesn't ever really do this ‚Äì moments of intense danger seem staged and although there are manly confrontations there isn't too much sustained pressure that translated across to the viewer. This failing leaves the film feeling a bit pedestrian even if it does enough to engage to a certain degree.The cast help it, in particular the presence of Johnson. He is not a great actor but he is more than enough of a presence to make a difference; I've always found he has an easy charisma and this is another example of that working in the favor of the project. Supporting cast is less reliable even if there are some big names and faces in there such as Sarandon, Bernthal, Pepper, Williams, Velazquez and others. Bratt stars as the main threat but beyond looking a bit sinister he really does do anything of note.Snitch is a decent enough story told in a workmanlike fashion. It benefits from some good performances but it is still only a so-so watch and nothing more than that."
Beethoven's 2nd,1993,5.0,"Beethoven, the St. Bernard dog, becomes a father, but his girlfriend Missy is dognapped, and his puppies are in danger of the same fate.","I don't understand the trashing comments I just read.  This film is very, very good.  I've seen it at least 5 or 6 times and it was enjoyable the first and last time I saw it.  The film making was superb.  I actually did some research to see where that cottage was located and see if there were any rentals.I saw no character flaws in anyone.  Each character was precise and very believable.  Continuity errors were at a minimum.  I also don't understand the rating this movie got.  It was NOT THAT BAD!  If there was poor acting, or plots, or errors then I could see trashing the movie.  But really!Even the musical score was perfect for each scene.  A mixture of real classical and real rock.  The music score designer deserves an 'A'.Best parts: 1) Beethoven's nose in the beginning, followed by his dream sequence. 2) Anything Regina did.  She was perfect! 3) Grodin trying to explain where babies come from. 3) The bully sequence at the fair (bite this guy in the weiner!) 4) The hamburger eating contest. 5) The tree stump scene with Penn. 6) Finally, all of the grunting noises Beethoven made.  I can actually imitate each one.  My kids love it when I do that.Come on people.  The movie was really enjoyable with quality Hollywood direction and design.  Please stop knocking it.  Give it another try.  Or next time, try watching it with a child.  You'll see."
Free Willy,1993,6.1,"When a boy learns that a beloved killer whale is to be killed by the aquarium owners, the boy risks everything to free the whale.","Willy is a wild orca that was trapped and separated from his parents. He is sent to an aquarium. Jesse (Jason James Richter) is a street kid who gets caught vandalizing the tank. He still believes his mom will come back. His social worker Dwight gets him off as long as he cleans up his mess. He's placed with Glen (Michael Madsen) and Annie Greenwood. Jesse is guarded and Glen is reluctant also. At the aquarium, he befriends Willy who saves his life one night. Willy won't perform for trainer Rae Lindley (Lori Petty) but he's willing to do it for Jesse. The owner Dial (Michael Ironside) is under pressure from the non-performing whale.It's a reasonable family picture. It has a whale and the little kids may find it fascinating. The story is compelling enough that the older kids will also like it. It's very much following a try and true formula. The young lead is acceptable even when he doesn't have the whale. He has some good drama to play off against. It's important to note that Keiko the whale was eventually freed. If that's all the movie achieves, that's plenty."
The Odd Couple II,1998,6.5,Mismatched roommates meet again years later.,"I thought the odd couple II was a funny movie,and some scenes were very funny. I also thought this movie was better than both grumpy old men movies,and my fellow americans. I give the odd couple II *** out of ****"
Beethoven,1992,5.7,"A slobbering St. Bernard becomes the center of attention for George and Alice Newton's loving family, who must contend with dog-napping local veterinarian Dr. Herman Varnick and his henchmen Harvey and Vernon.","Such a good movie, even after 26 years! A much watch when we have kids."
Grumpier Old Men,1995,6.7,"Just as John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, its new female owner catches Max's attention.","After the success of ""Grumpy Old Men"" a sequel was inevitable. The fact that it's also inferior to the hilarious first movie was also inevitable.Plot In A Paragraph: John and Max are still on good terms following the events at the end of last movie. They still greet each other in the same way, but now with affection. They join forces to save their beloveds bait shop from being turned into an Italian restaurant by its new owner (Sophia Loren) who has just took over.Almost all of the cast from the first movie return, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are their usual brilliant self, with their usual awesome charisma. Ann Margaret isn't given much to do this time around. Sophia Loren is certainly still a sex bomb. Burgess Meredith is back, and is as smutty if not smithies than the first time around. Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack both return too, and are both as reliable as you'd expect.Sadly, Grumpier Old Men was Burgess Meredith's final film. He looks in bad shape here, but still puts in a good fun, full of life performance."
101 Dalmatians,1996,5.8,An evil high-fashion designer plots to steal dalmatian puppies in order to make an extravagant fur coat but creates an extravagant mess instead.,"It's no surprise that Glenn Close was incredible in her performance as Cruella de Vil. She's so in tune with the cruel and malicious nature that comes with this infamous Disney villain.I'm genuinely surprised the film has such a low rating. It's not perfect, but I believe it's a fun film for all ages to watch."
The Net,1995,6.0,"When Angela Bennett, a computer programmer, stumbles upon government secrets, she finds herself on the run from an unknown enemy hell-bent on destroying her completely.","This awesome, action-packed little gem, is one of my all-time favorite movies!! Sandra Bullock, once again, outdoes herself in this wicked film all about the Internet and the taking-over of people's lives.In 'The Net', Bullock stars as Angela Bennett, a computer-whizz, who while on holiday, encounters a dangerous man, who steals her wallet... and her life.Soon, the real Angela Bennett disappears, and an ex-con, takes on her identity, swapping her life for Angelas!Of course, Sandy isn't the type to take this kinda thing lying down - and all on her own, she fights hard to get back the life they took away from her.A wicked film - that'll leave you breathless for start to finish!! 9/10"
Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey,1993,7.0,"A fun-loving American bulldog pup, a hilarious Himalayan cat, and a wise old golden retriever embark on a long trek through the rugged wilderness of the Sierra Nevada mountains in a quest to reach home and their beloved owners.","A perfect family film that everyone will
Enjoy. Loved this film as a kid and as an adult it's still really good. I wish they made more films like this."
21,2008,6.8,"Inspired by real events and people, 21 is about six MIT students who become trained to be experts in card counting in blackjack and subsequently took Vegas casinos for millions in winnings.","I was lucky enough to see this film for free at a special screening in greater London as part of a market research by the film industry. even though it was free i would have paid good money to see that film. but I was presently surprised about how good the film was and everyone seemed to agree that the film was really good. I thought it made the card playing parts actually riveting even though i am not a card player myself. i thought the acting performances were all good especially that of Kevin Spacey's. In terms of the story. In many ways it reminded me of all the good things that was in the BBC TV show hustle. But in a much more real way. On the down side, you may see the ending coming and there is a romance part of the film that feels unnecessary. However it is a very slick film that gets away with it. I would say that it clearly the best film in this genre of film. I enjoyed it more than films such as Confidence and the Oceans 11 type films. I would highly recommend it to anybody when it eventually comes out in April!! I would have thought that they would cut down and re-edit it a bit on the basis that it was quite long. however it kept my attention for the whole film and that is not something that is also done during these sorts of films"
2 Days in New York,2012,6.0,"Manhattan couple Marion and Mingus, who each have children from prior relationships, find their comfortable family dynamic jostled by a visit from Marion's relatives.","A follow-up to Julie Delpy's first directorial effort, ""Two Days in Paris,"" that's quite a bit more entertaining, IMHO, than the original. The premise‚ÄîJD and Chris Rock are Marion and Mingus, Downtown culture workers with two slightly troubled, adorable kids‚Äîdoesn't quite fulfill its promise but fans of Richard Linklater's ""Before"" films might want to take a chance.The main storyline chugs along pretty nicely: the couple endures a brief visit from her elderly flowerchild father (""he says that showers deplete the immune system""), tactlesss sister and sister's doltish boyfriend. Parallel plots involving a gallery opening (she's some sort of conceptual art photog) and a colossal Lucy-style whopper she tells a neighbor to get out of a minor scrape are a little draggy, though a couple of these filler scenes have a modest payoff later on. Delpy plays pretty much the same talky, frazzled, excitable character she does in the ""Before"" films; Chris Rock seems a little colorless (as it were), as if he's trying too hard to escape from his standup persona (the scenes where he soliloquizes to a cardboard-cutout Obama didn't do much for me).Delpy's been accused of being a self-hating Frenchy, but I think the point is that people tend to behave as if the stuff they do in a foreign country doesn't really go on their permanent record‚ÄîSis swans around in a T-shirt that doesn't quite cover her butt, par example, Dad takes his keys to the lustrous flanks of a stretch Hummer (back home he only does that if they're parked on the sidewalk), boyfriend Manu commits every possible faux pas. The highpoint is a scene where Mingus, who writes for the Village Voice, is trying to score points with a dark-complected White House staffer (not played by Kal Penn) they run into in a caf√©, and the sisters immediately start bickering while Manu babbles on about Harold and Kumar going to White Castle¬Ö Not a must-see at all but definitely watchable.PS‚Äîa reviewer down below insists that Marion's French connections don't act right b/c they're ""gritty"" Bretons, not Parisians. Au contraire! Both films make clear that Dad's a gallery owner, Sis a child psychologist and Manu some sort of writer; they're from Paris."
Relatos salvajes,2014,8.1,Six short stories that explore the extremities of human behavior involving people in distress.,"Reviewers say 'Wild Tales' is an anthology film exploring revenge, rage, and societal issues through six stories. Directed by Dami√°n Szifron, it blends dark humor with intense drama, often surprising audiences. Critics commend its inventive storytelling, strong performances, and the director's balance of humor and social commentary. While some segments stand out, others are less effective, resulting in a mixed but generally positive reception. The cinematography, soundtrack, and ensemble cast enhance its engaging, thought-provoking experience."
Unstoppable,2010,6.8,"With an unmanned, half-mile-long freight train barreling toward a city, a veteran engineer and a young conductor race against the clock to prevent a catastrophe.","Mark Bomback's writing was outstanding in using his 98 min runtime to squeeze in the perfect amount of character development, tension, suspense, and action. All casting and performances were excellent and Denzel and Chris Pine's chemistry was spot on. The S/VFX were amazing, as was the score. My big issue was the annoying and seizure-inducing fast zoom-in/outs director Tony Scott chose to use. Thankfully they became less frequent as the film progressed. It' an 8/10 from me."
2 Guns,2013,6.7,"Two hardened criminals get into trouble with the US border patrol after meeting with a Mexican drug lord, and then revelations start to unfold.",Had a chance to view it this week with only the trailer as a guide as to what I was about to see. It turned out to be mildly better than I was anticipating. Mark Wahlberg brought a comical element that worked with the overall story with Denzel basically being the straight man throughout. Denzel plays his role smoothly with a slight sarcastic comedic side. I thought they both played off each other very well to keep you intrigued with the ongoing twisting plot. Good to see James Edward Olmos after a long absence from the big screen. Always be LT. Castillo from Miami Vice fame to me. Don't base your opinion on the trailer as I had. Worth a look.
Pain,2013,6.4,A trio of bodybuilders in Florida get caught up in an extortion ring and a kidnapping scheme that goes terribly wrong.,"The overwhelming sense I get from all the negative reviews on here is that the comedy in this true story is irresponsible and wrong. Well I think that's just a couple prunes trying to ruin a really good movie. I don't think Michael Bay set out or achieved any disrespect towards the victims. The absurd details of this case mixed with the excellent acting of the principal three actors create an extremely enjoyable movie with some laughs here and there. The editing is excellent and this movie should be rated at least a 7.1
One of the best if not the best movie Mr. Michael Bay has made. It deserves more credit."
Out of Time,2003,6.5,A Florida police chief must solve a vicious double homicide before he himself falls under suspicion.,"While staying in a motel in Bandon, Oregon (on the southern coast) over the past weekend, I noticed that the room had a number of DVDs, including ""Out of Time"". I decided to kill some time watching it, not expecting very much. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.I should identify that the movie has nothing to do with the Rolling Stones' song. Denzel Washington plays Matt Whitlock, a cop in a small Florida town. He's been having an affair with a certain Ann (Sanaa Lathan). Since she's dying of cancer, she's made him the beneficiary of her will. But when she and her husband die in a fire, all evidence points to Matt (you'll understand what I mean if you see the movie). So arises the quandary of how he's going to solve the case and clear his name before it's too late, especially given that his ex-wife Alex (Eva Mendes) is absolutely intent on solving the case.The movie's real strength lies in the twists and turns that they throw in from time to time. I think that probably the coolest scene is the whole sequence in the police station about halfway through the movie; I would have never imagined any movie having a whole sequence like that! But I actually considered Matt's friend Chae (John Billingsley) to be the best character in the movie; I mean, some of those monologues were so great.All in all, it's not any kind of masterpiece. But it's better than your average man-on-the-run-has-to-clear-himself story. And if I may say so, Eva Mendes looked mighty fine in some of those outfits!"
Hairspray,2007,6.7,Pleasantly plump teenager Tracy Turnblad teaches 1962 Baltimore a thing or two about integration after landing a spot on a local TV dance show.,"Had it not been for a free pass to an advance screening, I must admit that my friends would have had trouble getting me to see 'Hairspray.' I don't mind musicals but 'Hairspray' didn't seem like something I'd enjoy. Not for the first time in my life was I wrong.'Hairpsray' is about tolerance, integration and acceptance of others. The film uses the racial divide between blacks and whites but the subtext of the film is Heterosexuals and Homosexuals. 'Hairspray' viciously lampoons bigots and reserves specific devastation for Ultra-conservative religious zealots, figures of authority and WASPs. The satire is white hot (Alison Janney steals every scene she is in), the music catchy, the movie's spirit is irreverent.I had no problems with the cast and their performances. John Travolta isn't bad and when he gets his chances to dance he's great fun. Christopher Walken and Travolta have a song and dance number duet that rates among the best moments of the film and isn't to be missed. Queen Latifah adds some dignity and balance while Michelle Pfeiffer plays a terrific screen villainess. Amanda Bynes has few lines to deliver but gives perfect comic deadpan when she does for excellent comic effect. Keep a sharp eye out for the hilarious John Waters cameo during the opening number.Of recent major movie musicals, this is easily better than 'The Producers,' (better comedy and music) and last year's 'Dreamgirls' (weaker songs but better pacing and strong beyond the first half). Although it doesn't have the star power or scale, I also prefer it to 'Chicago' -- 'Hairspray' takes itself less seriously and not many movies have me laughing and smiling from start to finish. If you're looking for a little pure counter-culture escapist fun, 'Hairpsray' is your movie."
Inside Man,2006,7.6,"A police detective, a bank robber and a high-power broker enter high-stakes negotiations after the criminal's brilliant heist spirals into a hostage situation.","In the crime/mystery genre Inside Man is just a bit better than a normal good movie. It's not excellent though, for that the heist is just too far fetched and perfect. Everybody likes to watch the perfect heist but in this case it's a bit exaggerated. But other than that small detail the rest of the movie is suspenseful, or at least it keeps you attentive as you keep wondering what will happen. For that there was the excellent interaction between Denzel Washington and Clive Owen. Both did a great job with their characters. The whole cast was perfect for this story. Spike Lee made another entertaining movie, one that I will watch again in a few years."
Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex * But Were Afraid to Ask,1972,6.7,Seven stories are trying to answer the question: what is sex? Or maybe they are not trying.,"While all the early Woody Allen films are funny and worthwhile, this is probably the most uneven to my taste.Allen took the famous, serious non-fiction book about sex, and turned it into a series of short comedy pieces. A couple segments are pure genius (inside the male body during sex, Gene Wilder falling in love with a sheep), a couple are pretty good (Woody as a medieval court jester trying to have an affair with the queen, who is locked into a chastity belt, a mad scientist creates a giant milk squirting breast that goes on a rampage) and a few are real duds.Also, of all the Allen films, this might have the worst DVD print/transfer quality.It's bizarre and disturbing is that a lot of Allen's brilliant early work seems to be going out of print. Hopefully this is just a temporary state of affairs, and better re-releases are ahead. But if you're a fan you might want to grab copies of this, Bananas, Sleeper, Take the Money and Run, etc now, while you can."
Transcendence,2014,6.2,A scientist's drive for artificial intelligence takes on dangerous implications when his own consciousness is uploaded into one such program.,"Transcendence, much like most of the latest sci-fi themed films to hit cinemas, is a wasted effort. It exhibits signature Pfister cinematography that we've come to love over the past decade. With Nolan's Batman trilogy and Inception, it was only a matter of time for Wally Pfister to take a stab at directing. Unfortunately, the only thing that seems well done in this film is the cinematography. The story, while seeming fresh and exciting on paper, devolves into a half baked idea with mediocre acting. Johnny Depp does the best he can while only being a mere voice during the latter half of the film. The rest of the cast seems wasted, this is especially true because we know how great Paul Bettany, Morgan Freeman and Rebecca Hall can be. Wally Pfister focuses more on capturing really fantastic shots but seems never truly devoted to the actual story. This comes as a major disappointment especially because of the hype that this film has been generating over the last year. When it boils down to it, Transcendence is just another exercise in style over substance, never matriculating to anything more than an average sci-fi thriller that has a criminally underused cast and phenomenal camera-work."
Mary and Martha,,6.8,Two mothers lose their sons to malaria.,We waste so much time worrying about such trivial things that aren't worth worrying about. Things that don't really matter. Our fancy cars. Our nails getting done. Our hair getting done. All while serious issues like scores of children dying from malaria in the real world. That's Reality. And this movie is emotional. The entire 2nd half of the movie was seen through tears. Sad tears. And triumphant tears.
American Sniper,2014,7.3,"Navy S.E.A.L. sniper Chris Kyle's pinpoint accuracy saves countless lives on the battlefield and turns him into a legend. Back home with his family after four tours of duty, however, Chris finds that it is the war he can't leave behind.","Chris Kyle was the most lethal sniper in the U.S. military history. He apparently killed more than 250 Iraqui insurgents, though the Pentagon only credited him around 160, which nevertheless made him a legend of the U.S. Army. I started to read the book last year but stopped doing it since I first heard about the project. Eastwood and Cooper on board, that is promising. And of course they both deliver, and ""American Sniper"" is dense and blunt, quite like a shot.Cooper plays Chris Kyle, the ultimate ""American"": religious, patriot and uncompromising in his convictions. He is a noble and honest man regarding every aspect of his life, and that is something to respect. Cooper already played a soldier in ""The A-Team"" remake (Joe Carnahan, 2010), and it seems that he showed great abilities in the military stunts, and showed interest in the work of the army. He bulked up 20 kg and went through a really tough training, including Navy SEAL sniper sessions. Sienna Miller plays his wife Taya, who suffered the effects of war on his husband, despite his strong belief and determination. Her unconditional love was a massive support for Kyle.Eastwood has made an intense and heartfelt film, one of his trademarks, absent shows and unnecessary politics or philosophy. This is obviously the classic ""American"" patriotic film, but it differs from others in the approach of the man, who is an instrument to a purpose, yet a human being totally aware of what he does.Bottom line, this film is almost perfect in many aspects, and the only thing that does not hook me is how much it reminds me to ""The Hurt Locker"" (Kathryn Bigelow, 2008). That was way more focused on the adrenaline addiction the main character had, but the behavior of both characters after tours seemed to me pretty alike."
Doom,2005,5.2,Space Marines are sent to investigate strange events at a research facility on Mars but find themselves at the mercy of genetically enhanced killing machines.,"There are certain genres that are despised no matter what. The genre of movies based on video games is one of those and rightfully so. There have been a large amount pretty awful video game adaptations of such games as Wing Commander, Super Mario Bros., Tomb Raider, Street Fighter, Double Dragon, and House of the Dead. There have been, however, some decent adaptations like Mortal Kombat (the first film, not the sequel) and the Resident Evil films. Now that I've viewed the unrated version, DOOM can be added to that list. Although not nearly as stylish and entertaining as Mortal Kombat or Resident Evil, DOOM may not be the mind-blowing spectacle that fans of the video game were hoping for, but at least it knows what it is: a fun ALIENS knock-off. Unlike ALIENS, Doom lacks a strong story and well-developed characters that the audience can cheer for. The characters here are barely one dimensional. They are given essentially no motivation for what they do and as a result, the movie suffers. Still, it's better than one would expect thanks to some slick directing, a couple solid action sequences, and The Rock. 7/10"
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?",2000,7.7,"In the deep south during the 1930s, three escaped convicts search for hidden treasure while a relentless lawman pursues them.","Those Coen brothers' movies really do grown on you. I had just seen Fargo when I rented this. It is one of the most creative, off the wall films I have ever seen. As these characters bumble their ways after a prison break, they are embraced by a series of the most unconventional personages ever to hit filmdom. And one gets turned into a frog--sort of. their flirtations with fame, the Klan, a cyclops, and all the other episodes, make this a hilarious romp. George Clooney's Ulysses is an obsessive, full speed ahead, damn the torpedoes, coupled with the charming half-wittedness of his fellow travelers, works at every level. Like Greek poetry, he is butting heads with the gods, but despite setbacks, keeps moving. It is story telling with charm and a load of bull. Everyone is some kind of philosopher, but the words come out of gap toothed, shaved headed hillbillies. And, of course, Clooney has hell to pay. I could watch this over and over again. And then there's the really cool music. I didn't even mention that!"
Robot & Frank,2012,7.0,"In the near future, an ex-jewel thief receives a gift from his son: a robot butler programmed to look after him. But soon the two companions try their luck as a heist team.","This film is about an old man with dementia who forms an unlikely attachment to his robot caretaker.""Robot And Frank"" has a really good plot. It tells how a man has to bear with a robot caretaker in order not to be admitted to a nursing home. From his ability to plot big projects, it seems that his functional ability is not impaired. However, we see later on that in fact he does not remember even the most fundamental stuff. This shock is quite a surprise. In addition, I really like the parallels and opposites in the plot. We see Frank's attitude to the robot change, his attitude to his daughter change, and how Frank and the robot both lose their memories. Apart from the plot, the sets are nice as well; simplistic, bright and modern settings make the visuals appealing. Acting by Frank Langella is impressive as well, he really conveys the feelings and thoughts of his character very well. I enjoyed watching ""Robot And Frank""."
Modern Family,,8.5,"Three different, but related, families face trials and tribulations in their own uniquely comedic ways.","Reviewers say 'Modern Family' is acclaimed for its unique mockumentary format, engaging characters, and sharp wit. The series effectively portrays modern family dynamics and current issues, striking a chord with viewers. The stellar cast, especially Ed O'Neill, Ty Burrell, and Sofia Vergara, is lauded for their compelling performances. Critics also highlight the show's adept mix of comedy and emotional depth. While praised for its character development over eleven seasons, some reviewers note a decline in charm during the later seasons."
Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco,1996,5.9,"When adventurous pets Chance, Shadow, and Sassy are accidentally separated from their vacationing humans, they're left to fend for themselves on the mean streets of San Francisco, searching for the ""golden bridge"" that will take them home.","A lackadaisical sequel.The wilderness is, arguably, the main reason why 'Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey', and the film it remakes, is enjoyable. That's because it, obviously, feels peculiar seeing a cat and two dogs in the wild. So what does this film do? It puts them back in their natural habitat, so you're just left with emotionless animals talking telepathically in street alleys. To no-one's surprise, that's super boring.Credit to Michael J. Fox for reprising his role as Chance. He doesn't mind doing sequels, even ones of a poorer variety; e.g. 'Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild' - on that note, I guess 'Atlantis: Milo's Return' was a step too far, understandably so!Elsewhere on the cast, all the main humans return as does Sally Field as Sassy. Ralph Waite comes in to replace the late Don Ameche as Shadow, I didn't actually notice a difference if I'm completely honest - astute casting! The film also adds a bunch of random cats and dogs to proceedings, absolutely none of them are memorable; despite a few recognisable names in the cast, including Carla Gugino (Delilah).I'm sure some, especially younger audiences, will find enjoyment here. For me, it's a lame follow-up."
Sin City: A Dame to Kill For,2014,6.5,Some of Sin City's most hard-boiled citizens cross paths with a few of its more reviled inhabitants.,"*Minor spoilers involving structure of the film, no plot points*In short, it isn't nearly as bad as everyone is saying. Let me elaborate.In case people don't know, the first Sin City from 2005 was based on the 1st, 3rd and 4th books in the 7 part series by Frank Miller. These follow the story lines of Marv, Dwight and Hartigan respectively. In addition to those, there are also a few shorts thrown in, either from the books or not. So, needless to say, Sin City and its sequel are both anthology films. If you want one single story that takes 2 hours, this may not be your thing.Sin City 2 follows almost the exact same structure as the original, which I found nice. Sure they didn't do anything original with the structure, which was sort of playing it safe, but I liked it. It felt familiar and reminded me of the original which I loved very much. It begins with another short story, this time starring Marv. It rocks. It continues on with a new story not contained in any of the books. It stars Johnny, a gambler who ""never loses"". Mid way through, we cut to another story. This is the 2nd book, titled ""A Dame to Kill For"". If you've read this, you won't see anything new. Like with the first film, they essentially translated the story from page to screen, and it works for the most part. There was one detail I didn't like, but it doesn't last long. Then after that, we finish up the story with Johnny, and finally, we get to the revenge mission involving Nancy and her hunt for Senator Rourke. That's all I'll say about that.Everyone is complaining about how the movie looks like a cutscene from a video game. They are sort of right, but not entirely. Even after waiting 2 weeks, I was unable to find a theatre in my city showing the film in 2d. It seems like this is happening more and more now. If you want to see an action movie in theatres, it's 3d whether you like it or not. Now, having not seen a 2d version to make a comparison, I can say that the 3d is most likely what makes it look so video game-y. I'm sure in 2d it'll look slightly better at least.Update: I did see it in 1080p and in 2D, and it does look less like a video game cutscene. You can still tell that there's a lot of CGI, but it's done better than a lot of films.Also, greenscreen sets have been used for over a decade now, I don't see why people are complaining so much. Everything is a CGI-fest these days, and this story, with a fantastic setting and extraordinary physics pulls it off nicely. You can tell, but it's far from awful.Everyone is saying they loved the first one, but hated this one. I don't see how that's possible. They stuck very close to the original in most ways, such as cinematography, soundtrack, and directing, all of which were great (for a Sin City movie). Sure it isn't a masterpiece my any means, and it's not as good as the first, but it's super entertaining, very violent, and is sure to please anyone who enjoys the books or the first film. Forget all those jaded movie snobs saying it sucks. They're just focusing on all the negatives, and letting that cloud their vision of the awesome stuff."
Boyhood,2014,7.9,"The life of Mason, from early childhood to his arrival at college.","I was nervous going in because I wanted Boyhood to be good. In fact, I wanted it to be spectacular. I've been a fan of Richard Linklater's career since I watched Before Sunrise (a viewing of Before Sunset quickly followed) back in 2010. His ability to capture an experience, a culture, a generation, and a life and translate it into film in such a way that is utterly beguiling, yet doesn't feel manipulated is staggering to watch. News of Boyhood reached me around this time last year, and before I knew much about it, I was hooked. A film from Richard Linklater about a young man growing up around the same time I did? And 12 years of filming were dedicated? It was going to be spectacular. So much for nothing in life being certain.Allow me, if you will, to avoid the part where I colorfully unpeel Boyhood's dynamics, hinting along the way how well it fairs against everything I've seen. IT. IS. UNBELIEVABLE. The script, the execution, the profoundness, and seamless integration of time are nothing short of astonishing. Subdued in nature as it may be, Boyhood is a vivid, captivating, all-consuming assault on the senses. Not only that, there is a deep seated quality to everything it does. And the viewer is absolutely at the core of the experience. Each element has been created and tuned to allow you to express yourself anyway you wish. And that amazing focus has produced a breathtaking film.From a technical standpoint, it's everything I've come to expect from Linklater, only finished to a higher standard. Boyhood is a film about life. The script has no rising action, climax, or falling action. There is no plot driven by a narrative driven by a goal. Nothing feels manipulated. Linklater's directing is level-headed and controlled, with quick cuts to whoever is talking and a lack of camera motion for a truly first-person omniscient feel. You are observing, but not fully knowing. And the cinematography... was there even a cinematographer? Boyhood's sets look so painfully boring because everything looks so natural, the background fades and allows 100% of your focus to be on the characters.Despite a silent car ride home and very much conducive analysis, my brain is STILL buffering from the mind-blowing quality of it all. I wonder how I will view my words when this high subsides. My final scattered thought is this; The best moments in film are when it comes across something; a thought, a feeling, a way of looking at things that you'd thought was special and particular to you. And here it is, set down by someone else, a person you've never met. And it's as if a hand has come out and taken yours. That is what Richard Linklater has done. Boyhood is a great film. More importantly it's a great film from Richard Linklater. Maybe even the greatest. and his career is here to stay."
Boy A,2007,7.5,"The story of a young Jack, newly released from serving a prison sentence for a violent crime he committed as a child.","We have all came across the stories and events of young children committing terrible crimes. They must be evil and need to be locked away as they are clearly not the same as you and me are they? Well what if they were the same, only they had a moment of madness, a moment that they did without thinking when they were young enough to know it was wrong but not too fully realise the full extent of their actions? This film does what all great films do, it educates and opens your eyes and mind to new on suggestions, in a sense it widens your experiences. If you really let it this film will get into your head and cause you to fight with your preconceived ideas on punishment for people or whether they deserve forgiveness.This is a great film, I really liked it but I felt uncomfortable during most of it because I knew deep down it was just asking me a question. I know what the lead character did is wrong, I know he was a child when he did it, but now you see him in a new life, touching other people's lives. The film does have an ending for you but this is not the point of the film. The really ending is in your head and it stays with you, ""are you are willing to forgive someone like Jack?"""
The Island,2005,6.8,"In 2019, a mercenary pursues a man and woman who escaped a research facility after learning their true fate.","This movie shows you exactly where we're headed to as a society, if not there already. Conformity and obeying (blindly), no emotions, nor humanity, no wondering nor questioning, no self-reflection. Humanity being lied to and enslaved by the forever ruling 1%.Wake up !"
The Tailor of Panama,2001,6.1,A tailor living in Panama reluctantly becomes a spy for a British Agent.,"It's too bad about the low IMDB rating for this movie. It is a deft blend of James Bond, Casablanca and Dr Strangelove which directs its often vicious tongue-in-cheek barbs at both the intelligence industry and the spy films which glorify it. While it can be enjoyed ""straight"", that is as a story in its own right, I think those who miss its satirical structure (the film doesn't directly let the audience in on the joke - it must be inferred), miss half the fun."
The Time Traveler's Wife,2009,7.1,"Henry DeTamble, a librarian, possesses a unique gene that lets him involuntarily travel through time. His wife, Claire Abshire, finds it difficult to cope with it.","In Chicago, the special collections librarian Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana) has a genetic anomaly that allows him to travel in time; however, he is not able to control the moment or the destiny of his voyages. When the stranger Clare Abshire (Rachel McAdams) meets him in the library, she invites him to have dinner with her in his favorite restaurant Beau Thai where she confesses that she has been in love with him since she was six years old. Henry leans that he had visited her many times in the real state of her parents and he falls in love with her. Sooner they get married, but the life of Clare becomes troubled with the successive unexpected travels of her beloved husband.""The Time Traveler's Wife"" is a delightful love story with an original romance of a time traveler that wins the heart of his wife when she was six years old and he was older. Therefore he does not know her in the present time. The chemistry between Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams is wonderful and makes their love absolutely believable. However, the girl Brooklynn Proulx steals the movie with a marvelous performance. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Te Amarei Para Sempre"" (""I Will Love You Forever"")"
Changeling,2008,7.7,"After Christine's son goes missing, she reaches out to the LAPD to find him, but when they try to pass off an impostor as her son to quiet public protests, she refuses to accept him or give up hope.","Clint Eastwood is one of the legends of the silver screen, from his humble beginnings as the Man With No Name in Sergio Leone westerns to Dirty Harry the kick-butt cop. As a director, he has given us some of the finest stories we could ever see, including the Oscar-winning Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby, and the war epic twins Flags of Our Fathers and Letters From Iwo Jima. With his new film, he explores the dark side of the earlier part of the twentieth century in Tinseltown (Los Angeles). Taken from true events, the story unfolds that a single mother Christine Collins has lost her nine-year old son, Walter. She asks the LAPD to intervene, and about two months later, her son is returned. Then, she says it isn't her son. She never looks back.From the moment the young boy steps off the train, Christine insists to everyone that he is not her son. Unfortunately, the police say she is delusional and just upset. The films leads to the truth of the matter, which is that the corruption in the department has led to them being lackadaisical in their duties. The story moves along fluidly, yet we are never really told the reason that corruption resides.Nevertheless, the film is quite an experience. It looks terrific and really feels like the 1920s in Los Angeles. Angelina Jolie is solid as Christine, yet I felt she seemed more whiny at times than desperate. It just didn't move me as strongly as Hilary Swank in Million Dollar Baby. The supporting cast is good as well, especially John Malkovich as the pastor eager to help Christine in the fight against the LAPD. What I really wanted was that emotional pull that Eastwood's other films had. This one seemed a bit cold and ruthless, despite that being its subject material. So, I would say to go and see it; it is definitely worth the 140 minutes. As for Oscar time, I can't say for sure that it will wrap up the big ones such as Best Picture, Director or Actress. It wasn't the strongest campaign I've seen, but then again this has been a weaker year than 2007."
Wild,2014,7.1,"A chronicle of one woman's 1,100-mile solo hike undertaken as a way to recover from a recent personal tragedy.","This was a great movie and exactly what I needed! I know from now on to not listen to most of the reviews on here at all. They are the opposite of good!? This was along the lines of Into The Wild, not as good but not bad at all and worth watching. Well done! This could be called a chick flick for real women who want substance, Strength and encouragement from the female in the role. When the world gets to much and is sucking your life away- Get the heck out and walk, climb a mountain , ride a horse ! Push the boundaries of what you think you are capable of and learn! I cried , it was good. I didn't know anything about it until I watched it. I have been coming to IMDb to pick movies with good ratings and people giving good reviews. Only to be disappointed time and again. If you like the Idea of the film , you will likely enjoy it as much as I did."
Chef,2014,7.3,"A head chef quits his restaurant job and buys a food truck in an effort to reclaim his creative promise, while piecing back together his estranged family.","A very enjoyable film, fun storyline, great acting, and an amazing soundtrack. Loved the journey and genuinely felt invested in the characters and story."
De zomer van de witte haai,1975,8.1,"When a massive killer shark unleashes chaos on a beach community off Long Island, it's up to the local police chief, a marine biologist, and an old seafarer to hunt the beast down.","Reviewers say 'Jaws' is acclaimed for revolutionizing the film industry with its summer blockbuster concept. It is praised for suspenseful storytelling, practical effects, and John Williams' iconic score. Central themes include fear, survival, and nature versus human ambition. Performances by Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw are lauded for depth and chemistry. However, some find the first half slow and shark effects dated, though the second half's tension is celebrated. 'Jaws' is noted for its cultural impact and cinematic legacy."
Still Alice,2014,7.5,A linguistics professor and her family find their bonds tested when she is diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease.,"Still Alice tells the story of a Columbia cognitive psychologist diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease played by Julianne Moore who in my opinion gave the best performance of her career.Kristen Stewart and Alec Baldwin also give very good performances and I think that Ms.Stewart successfully shed the ""Twilight"" vampire stereotype.Just like any disease, your fight is as strong as your support system. Not only Alice's but Julianne Moore's support system is strong as well with a supporting cast of Kristen Stewart, Alec Baldwin, Kate Bosworth and Hunter Parrish, and a score that never has the audience wondering about their emotions but has them focused on Alice's.An amazing movie I recommend it to everyone"
Foxcatcher,2014,7.0,"U.S. Olympic wrestling champions and brothers Mark Schultz and Dave Schultz join ""Team Foxcatcher"", led by eccentric multi-millionaire John du Pont, as they train for the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea, but John's self-destructive behavior threatens to consume them all.","Foxcatcher is a long movie but it never gets boring and that's something. As a Belgian I never heard of this story so for me it was all a surprise. I like movies based on a true story, certainly one like this one. The make-up crew should also get credits because what they did to Steve Carrell and Channing Tatum was very well done. It's because Steve Carrell as a specific voice that I recognized him immediately but with his changed physics I could have been fooled. He plays a really annoying character, one of those rich guys that thinks you can buy anybody or anything. But he did a very good job playing that arrogant prick. Channing Tatum looks like he came out straight of a cavern. He also did a good job, like all the rest of the cast. The story is interesting to watch and the end was surprising to me. I'm not a big fan of the wrestling sport but for this story it doesn't matter if you like it or not. Certainly worth a watch."

Capote,2005,7.3,"In 1959, Truman Capote learns of the murder of a Kansas family and decides to write a book about the case. While researching for his novel In Cold Blood, Capote forms a relationship with one of the killers, Perry Smith, who is on death row.","Director Bennet Miller's ""Capote"" is a film that shows great intelligence in the way it captured the essence of Truman Capote, a man who achieved fame and notoriety with most of the fiction he wrote. This film concentrates in the period of his life in which he got obsessed by a notorious murder case of the fifties about the murder of a family in Kansas.Dan Futterman has written the screen play based on the book by Gerald Clarke. The film is an account about the writing of the novel ""In Cold Blood"" that showed how the two young men who committed the heinous crime are caught, processed and hanged for their actions.If you haven't watched the film, perhaps you would like to stop here.When the film opens we get a vision of a lonely house in the distance. This being the Midwest, we are given a flat expanse devoid of elevations anywhere. The camera takes us to that lonely house as a young woman comes calling for her friend that lives in there. Not getting any response, she goes in to a room upstairs where she discovers her friend has been killed. The colors are dark, as is the tone of the film.Truman Capote, who had been connected to the New Yorker magazine, sees the article in the N.Y. Times and gets interested. This case that shocked the country, at the time, shows a promise for the writer. The next time we meet him, he is in the small town in Kansas accompanied by his good friend and steadying influence, Nell Harper Lee, a writer.By becoming friendly with the sheriff's wife, Mr. Capote gets a privilege by having access to the two murderers. Truman is clearly deeply affected by his relationship with Perry Smith, a handsome dark man who shows a lot of intensity. By gaining their trust, Capote is able to put together his best selling book ""In Cold Blood"", which will revolutionize American letters in the way the two criminals are portrayed.Truman Capote, while pursuing the completion of his book, doesn't come clean to Perry Smith. In fact, when questioned about things he has learned, Capote gives evasive answers because he is not prepared to share with his main subject things that clearly should have been clarified from the start.Watching the brilliant take of Philip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote on the screen, brought to mind another great actor, Meryl Streep, who like Mr. Hoffman is a chameleon in the interpretation of a character. Mr. Hoffman is perfect as the writer because he has captured every mannerism and the speech inflection of Truman Capote. Catherine Keener is perfect as Nelle, the true friend and companion. Bruce Greenwood plays Truman Capote's companion Jack Dunphy. Chris Cooper is totally wasted as Sheriff Dewey.Adam Kimmel excellent cinematography contributes to the atmosphere the director gave the film because of the use of muted colors in what appear to be the bleak winter of the Midwest."
Spanglish,2004,6.4,"A woman and her daughter leave Mexico for a better life in America, where they start working for a family whose patriarch is a newly-celebrated chef with an insecure wife.","There is most certainly something in Spanglish for every member of your family! The cast is fabulous. Spaniard Paz Vega appears quite natural and convincing as Mexican Flor Moreno. Adam Sandler shows definite versatility as both a dramatic and comedic actor. Tea Leoni, here almost outshines everyone in her role of a rather endearing but neurotic American housewife. And the young, Shelbie Bruce, playing the role of Flors daughter, Cristina, waxes totally bilingual/bicultural.However, do not let your pre-viewing expectations get too high! Regardless of being a must see film for all Hispanics who live, have lived or who have had an extended stay in the U. S., Spanglish does have its faults! Producer/director/writer, James L. Brooks, despite having directed such classics as Broadcast News, As Good As It Gets and Terms of Endearment, seems that here there are moments he became too enamored of his own work, causing some excesses. The film drags a bit at over 2 hours. It would have been a more enjoyable film if Brooks had left at least 10 or 15 minutes on the cutting room floor.In most of the standard areas one eveluates regarding the production values used in making Spanglish... It seems that just about all of them are quite acceptable. Probably even a tad better than most!However, Spanglish does suffer from moments of rather lackluster script-writing and direction of its principle characters, with too many mugging facial close-ups. These exaggerated expressions often did not seem the least bit natural. Spanglish also would like to convince us that someone can go from a beginner in English to someone with tremendous proficiency in a breezy 2 or 3 months! That seems like quite a lot of Suspension of Disbelief! If it were that easy, we would all speak five languages, right? Despite the few weaknesses highlighted here, Spanglish is guaranteed to impact you a lot! 7*******This review was redacted after going over the IMDb guidelines for submitting Reviews with the utmost intensive and extreme care. I am certain that it meets all the standards and points mentioned therein. So most certainly...I hope this Review will meet with Your approval and considered to be Helpful.....Enjoy!"
Deep Impact,1998,6.3,"A comet is discovered to be on a collision course with Earth. As doomsday nears, the human race prepares for the worst.","I think a lot of viewers wanted to compare this movie to Armageddon, especially since they were released so closely together. However, while the main storyline is similar, that's were the similarities end.
Just because Deep Impact didn't have everything going ""BOOM"" like Armageddon did, doesn't make it a boring movie. I was caught up in the narrative, the characters and the ""heart"" in this movie. There was substance in the storytelling. Duvall excels in leading a group of young, hotshot astronauts into space."
Fun with Dick and Jane,2005,6.2,"When an affluent couple lose all their money following a series of blunders, they turn to a life of crime to make ends meet.","This is the story of Dick, an ambitious marketing executive which is promoted to the top just on the day his corporation implodes due to some embezzlement scheme. The first 15 minutes (Dick's ascent) are really very, very funny - that's Jim Carrey at his best.The movie's best part is when you see Dick and his wife falling all the way to level where survival is really a struggle - this is actually very moving. Their ensuing blotched criminal career is on the other hand not so funny as you might expect -- you have the feeling that this is a very good serious movie trying to be funny just to meet the public's expectations."
People I Know,2002,5.4,A New York press agent must scramble when his major client becomes embroiled in a huge scandal.,"Don't pay that much attention about all the bad comments you will hear: this is a very interesting movie.To sum up, Al Pacino is an agent for all kind of people: stars, politicians... Therefore, he knows a lot of people and way too much about them. Now, the problem is that to many spectators the movie seemed empty. True there is no action, and true there is no big storyline. But it doesn't matter! This movie is about describing the ""high spheres"" of New York society. It is a good lesson on how corrupted the system is, how hypocrite people can be, and how you can't rely on anybody, even so-called friends. Everyone will turn his back on you when it comes to his own interest.Al Pacino acts great in this movie. It's a very hard part since there is no real guideline, but he does the job wonderfully. You will see an OLD Al Pacino, a TIRED Al Pacino, that might disappoints you if you remember him as the lively and shouting ""mister Devil's Advocate"", but it's an interesting side of him that you might discover."
Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,2011,6.9,"A nine-year-old amateur inventor, Francophile, and pacifist searches New York City for the lock that matches a mysterious key left behind by his father, who died in the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.","Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is a film that haunts you all day after the closing credits. I just watched it this morning, Sept. 11th, 2012--weeping continually, which is not a typical reaction from me. Powerful stuff.The story is about a child who lost his father in the World Trade Center attacks on that fateful day in our country's history. It is his journey to reconnect with his father's memory by going on a quest to find the lock that fits the key left mysteriously in a vase in his father's closet. Along the way, this shy and sensitive boy Oskar is forced to meet and interact with a range of citizens, and to hear their stories too.More importantly, it is about connectedness. It is about realizing that you aren't alone in your pain, and learning how to reach out to others for help and comfort. It is about realizing that your alone-ness is an illusion.I loved, loved, loved the chemistry of the father and son in the flashback scenes, loved the delightful and unconventional expeditions they embarked upon, and enjoyed coming along with Oskar and The Renter to solve the final mystery of the key. I thought that the child actor playing Oskar was wonderful in this breakout role; he carried the movie quite well, almost singlehandedly-- except for those scenes with Max Von Sydow's silent character, The Renter. Of course Von Sydow stole the show, and totally deserved his Academy nomination. In all, the actors were brilliant and compelling to match the heartfelt script.Yes, there was a certain amount of emotional manipulation involved in this tearjerker (what else could you expect from a Sandra Bullock production nowadays?). I can overlook that and wholeheartedly recommend EL&IC to anybody as possibly the best ""9/11"" film to date."
That's My Boy,2012,5.6,"While in his teens, Donny fathered a son, Todd, and raised him as a single parent until Todd's 18th birthday. Now Donny resurfaces just before Todd's wedding after years apart, sending the groom-to-be's world crashing down.","I do not see why there are so many people who hate on this movie, It is what it is, Its a comedy movie. In my opinion Sandler is going back to his comedic roots... I mean you cant tell me when he was on SNL and in some of his earlier movies he didn't act stupid, Maybe some of you reviewers are just getting old and don't know comedy anymore when you see it. See people need to stop critiquing a comedy like this based as though it was a movie in another genre. But thats just my opinion, If your looking for something funny I recommend seeing this. But you might need to be a specific age group, 12-36, I guess Sandler is tired of trying to make all you ""old fools"" laugh. Also Andy Samberg was great along with Will Forte and Nick Swardson, even though he only had like 4 lines."
T2 3-D: Battle Across Time,1996,7.6,Three freedom fighters attack a large corporation to prevent a future apocalypse.,"James Cameron has brought to us once again, a quality piece of entertainment. Much like the previous films that carry the name of ""Terminator"", ""T2/3-D: Battle Across Time"" shows with every frame the quality that Cameron strives for: Perfection. Every detail is attended to: The aiming of a laser beam which seems to target YOU in the audience, the puff of dust as a mini-hunter passes over a concrete pillar, the drops of moisture as a polymimetic alloy creature melts and reforms, as well as a rush of air as a flying HK craft passes over you. From the preshow, where a hostess, 'perky' to your face, but backstabbing when she thinks she's being ignored, welcomes you; to the interruption of the show by John and Sarah Connor, in an attempt to prevent another Apocalypse brought on by Skynet, the entire show leaves the visitor leaving with the satisfaction that T2/3-D was well worth the (most of the time) short wait. Even when waiting in line, there are monitors showing ""Cyberdine"" sample shows. You may even see a Terminator identified through the monitor system. It's almost too bad this high quality show is only available at Universal Studios."
Eraser,1996,6.2,A Witness Protection specialist becomes suspicious of his co-workers when dealing with a case involving high-tech weapons.,"After Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1997 heart surgery, his box office popularity faded. 1996's ""Kindergarten Cop"" is a comedy, and he did not play the lead role in ""Batman and Robin,"" even though his name grabbed him top billing. That makes ""Eraser"" his last great action film until ""Terminator 3"" became his last hurrah, for now anyway. Schwarzenegger plays John Kruger, ""The Eraser."" He puts the protection in the Witness Protection Program.I cannot imagine a better beginning. Two thugs have invaded the home of a Federal witness (Robert Pastorelli). His wife writhes on the floor as the duo prepare to burn the house. Hearing gagged screams of a visibly bound woman having gasoline poured on her is not a pleasant experience for most people, nor is the sight of an innocent man about to have his tongue removed. The sounds and images ramp up audience hate towards the two, then greatly increases the euphoria when Kruger comes in and kills them in a most unpleasant fashion. His timely rough justice spurs us to root even for him even harder later on, even if the effect is on a subconscious level.His next assignment is Lee Cullen (Vanessa Williams) who works Cyrez, a weapons manufacturer. Company President William Donahue (the always dependable James Cromwell) is selling high tech weapons on the open market, weapons that are supposed to be for the United States only. As Kruger points out, the men who recruit Cullen fail to inform her that she will need to be placed under Witness Protection. She refuses the program and returns home. An encounter with hi-tech hit men forces her to reconsider, and Kruger places her in a secret location and gives her a new identity.The new weapon is the rail gun. It uses magnetic fields to propel aluminum rounds close to the speed of light. Of course, that means it can shoot through walls, and its scope can see through them, though not in great detail. There is a side shot of one being fired later, and the rounds are obviously not moving as quickly as advertised. They leave a visible trail, but it takes two of three frames for them to move the length of the shot, when it should be all the way through in one, but I don't care. The graphic looks cool and such a small detail is hardly a deal breaker.Any list of the positives must start with Vanessa Williams. Cullen is hardly a part with Oscar caliber demands, but Williams plays her about as perfectly as possible. She is firm and disdainful when speaking to Donahue, then firm and surprised during her later meeting with FBI agents. She is often required to act fearfully, and in a state of controlled panic. Selling those emotions is not easy. I have acting experience, I should know. The former Miss America is more known as a singer than an actress, but her performance here illustrates why she received a musical theater scholarship to Syracuse. The aftermath of the first attack on her provides her best moment.Similar praise goes to James Caan, playing Kruger's mentor. Caan is also a talented actor. The same can also be said of James Coburn as the Witness Protection agency's highest officer. Both had spent over thirty years in movie acting by 1996, and there abilities are evident in how well they convey their authority. There are too many action films with weak acting, but people like Williams, Caan, Coburn and Pastorelli ensure that ""Eraser"" is the opposite. Melora Walters provides arguably the best acting in her small but animated part as the Pastorelli character's wife.The action, of course, must be well done, and for the most part it lives up to the Schwarzenegger standards. The opening scene is set up so well it does not have to be good, but it is, and the precedent is set. The action is not Arnold's best, but still more than adequate. I was disappointed at how little the rail gun is used, and I probably would have voted an eight if it made more appearances. When it does come, the action is not disappointing. Watching Arnold wield them brought a big smile to my face. Their lack of screen time a detriment, but with good acting and clever plot, there are still more than enough qualities to earn a full recommendation for yet another good effort from Mr. Schwarzenegger."
Public Enemies,2009,6.9,"The Feds try to take down notorious American gangsters John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and Pretty Boy Floyd during a booming crime wave in the 1930s.","Public Enemies is a crime drama based on the true story of the infamous bank robber of the 1930's, John Dillinger. Johnny Depp does an outstanding job playing the main character, but I don't feel that this is his best performance. Perhaps it is a lacking script that causes the unimpressive characterization. Christian Bale plays the FBI agent chasing Dillinger with fervor. His betrayal seems a bit dry and lackluster. The story is interesting and well paced, but there is slightly too much time put into the setup and not enough in the execution of the plot. The action sequences are quick and the machine gun shoot-outs are mind blowing. Overall, I left the theater feeling that this was a decent film with room for improvement. It is worth a watch, especially if you like the period portrayed. I give this movie 7 stars for a just-above mediocre production. I hope this review was helpful. -MovieJuice"
Last Action Hero,1993,6.5,"With the help of a magic ticket, a young movie fan is transported into the fictional world of his favorite action movie character.","This movie came when Arnie was at the height of his career and popularity. However Last Action Hero not only bombed at the box office it was a critical misery as well. However the film is being rediscovered and some have even asked for it to be reconsidered as if not a highly good satire, then at the very least a fun enjoyable charming film of the early 90s. Admittedly, this is not a good action film. Given its billing, director, and title, that's a surprise. On the other hand, Last Action Hero works as an unexpectedly witty comedy."
Jingle All the Way,1996,5.8,"A father vows to get his son a Turbo Man action figure for Christmas. However, every store is sold out, and he must travel all over town and compete with everybody else in order to find one.","Sometimes critics mistake.This is definitely an example.You see some movies don't need to be reviewed,you just need to watch them first,and then judge your feelings. So idea of the movie is great,and its pretty familiar to EVERY father on Christmas.And that's why people like to associate themselves with Arnie's character.There are a lot of misadventures(you wont remember every after ending i promise),but they actually work out pretty entertaining,sometimes even laughably funny (Santa's gang scene). Also contains good soundtrack,that includes Chuck Berry's ""Run Rudolf,Run"". i also like casting choice for Ted.I don't like this type of sleazy scumbags,thats why he is so realistically annoying.Not much else to say,WATCH IT NOW."
Johnny English,2003,6.3,"After a sudden attack on MI7, Johnny English, Britain's most confident, yet unintelligent spy, becomes Britain's only spy.","The talented Rowan Atkinson expands his character from a series of TV adverts shown in the UK in the late 1990's onto the big screen.So does the transfer from two-minute sketches adapt successfully into feature-length narrative? The answer surprisingly is quite well,although the film does have flat spots and gags that somewhat misfire.The plot and incidents that take place are an obvious mixture and borrowing from the NAKED GUN and AUSTIN POWERS series of parodies,but what is refreshing is that the character of Johnny English is mostly free of the occasional mugging that was witnessed in the above films,and also Atkinson's MR BEAN creation,which was of course wordless but did sometimes engage in some rather messy slapstick.There is some messy slapstick here,but Atkinson's interpretation is closer to his greatest comic character of Edmund BLACKADDER,with his sometimes cynical and sarcastic tone,though he has traits of bumbling incompetence like Mr.Bean,though not total idiocy which makes English more sympathetic.A lower budget than the AUSTIN POWERS series means there are fewer elaborate set pieces,but some scenes work very well and there are some witty exchanges of dialogue.There's decent support from Natalie Imbruglia,Ben Miller and Tim Pigott-Smith,but John Malkovich is the most amusing as the villain with his cod French accent.It is encouraging to see a comedy which underplays it's scenes these days,rather than performers shouting and screaming in a desperate bid to force laughter out of an audience.That said,some scenes in the film don't always come off,perhaps because they are understated too much,but the best bits are very funny(especially the final scenes)and further sequels with this character would be most welcome."
The Great Buck Howard,2008,6.4,"A young man, much to the chagrin of his father, becomes the new assistant to an illusionist in decline.","The Great Buck Howard is not a great movie, but it is sometimes a sweet movie. Deliberately pushing the nostalgia button, the film bathes in the lost star power of a once famous ""mentalist"" Buck Howard (John Malkovich), who best represents the simple days of magicians like the Amazing Kreskin (the inspiration for Buck's character). As with Kreskin, Buck once delighted the late night shows, Vegas venues, and small towns such as Akron, Ohio.Troy Gable (Colin Hanks) drops out of law school to become a writer (his uninspired voice over narration notwithstanding), but first he becomes Howard's assistant, much to the chagrin of his father (Tom Hanks‚Äîyes, that Hanks and that real-life father). Troy gets plenty of material from his boss, a dime-store vaudeville diva who yet displays a self confidence and pride to help the most cynical of us see the need to push on in the face of adversity, not the least of which is becoming pass√©.Along the way we might learn a thing or two about professional integrity, true grit, and the possibility of love in all the odd places. Troy seems to learn those lessons although Hanks so underplays it's hard to tell. Director Sean McGinly apparently can't coax anything more than dimpled smiles from Hanks, whose similarity to his dad is both physical and temperamental. ""Bland"" is another word that comes to mind although I found the younger Hanks more animated on the London stage.More passionate is publicist Valerie Brennan (Emily Blunt, reminding us of egos in Devil Wears Prada), with whom Troy must work and love. But, hey, even Malkovich underplays for this one, although his aging egotist is still impressive with the actor's patented impatience and theatrical outbursts. It's just that the underwhelming script doesn't allow the principals to rise above clich√©s, and the framing device of the relationship between narrator and mentalist goes nowhere (As it didn't for Gatsby's Nick either, I suppose).It's a small world of small town vaudeville, fading but eloquent about talent and the need to be who you really are. Not easy, that."
The Lone Ranger,2013,6.4,"Native American warrior Tonto recounts the untold tales that transformed John Reid, a man of the law, into a legend of justice.","Is The Lone Ranger a great movie? Not really, but it is relatively entertaining.Is the movie slow in the middle? A little, but not as bad as most critics would have you believe.The Lone Ranger is a bit long and does ask you to be patient at times, something that seems to be lost in the modern video-game world we live in.The strength of the movie lies squarely with Johnny Depp and his portrayal of Tonto. I seriously doubt that any other actor could have pulled it off. Depp deadpans through several one-liners, which gives us much of the movie's humor. In Depp's capable hands, the character of Tonto is both admirable and witty, with a charm all his own.The first part of the movie definitely gets us started with a bang. It does jump around quite a bit in the first few scenes, which seemed a little disjointed at times, but things are tied together well enough as the movie progresses.The middle of the movie is slower, but we are provided with many of the answers as to the back history of the characters, especially with Tonto and the villains. I will agree that the movie could have accomplished the same with five to ten less minutes, but that is certainly not an adequate reason, in itself, to skewer the film.And the last few scenes are the non-stop action sequences that most modern audiences love, although they do almost come off as cartoonish at times.As stated, Depp's performance is the single biggest selling point for this movie. I thought William Fichtner was very good as Butch Cavendish, the film's main villain. Tom Wilkinson, James Badge Dale, Ruth Wilson, and Helena Bonham Carter all lend excellent support.Of the movie's title character, I'm not sure that someone else other than Armie Hammer wouldn't have made a better Lone Ranger. That being said, the interactions and dialog between him and Depp's Tonto are enjoyable and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny. In many ways, this is a buddy movie, albeit with a bit of a twist.Perhaps, one of the main reasons critics dislike the movie is its title. For all intents and purposes, this is really a Tonto movie. It is more his story and told from his point of view. It probably should have properly been called Tonto. But I don't see that as being a bad thing at all.If you take it for what it is, The Lone Ranger is a reasonably entertaining film, with a very strong performance by Depp. And that was enough for me to give it a 7 out of 10."
40 Days and 40 Nights,2002,5.6,"After a brutal break-up, a young man vows to stay celibate during the forty days of Lent, but finds the girl of his dreams and is unable to do anything about it.","After his girlfriend dumps him Matt goes through a lot of meaningless sex that makes him feel bad,so in order to give himself time to recover he decides to give up sex and anything to do with sex for Lent.I liked the idea, but the movie ended up being a disappointment.Josh Hartnett is pretty bad in this movie. I can't think of any other movies with him, but considering that I know his name he did a few, so he might be a good actor. But this movie really doesn't show it. I wonder if he even knew it was a comedy, because he sure didn't act as if he did.Actually besides having a more or less original idea for a romantic comedy the movie didn't go too far from it. The joke was pretty much the same all through 90 minutes. And it was also stupid. It was the kind of sentiment I would expect for a teen movie, but the characters in this one were in their 20's, the whole ""omg the poor guy can't live without sex"" thing is just dumb. And this is what the whole movie was about, exaggerated and annoying.Also, while I think sex themed comedies can be very funny. Only this one was trying to be romantic, and this is what made her sexual theme fail. Some of the jokes were off, and seemed more vulgar than funny for the genre. Actually the only time I laughed was at the Bagel Boy.The story was not well thought through. It makes no sense whatsoever to me why Erica was mad at Matt about the whole abstinence thing. It's not like he decided not to have sex ever again in his life, or that it was a personal insult to her or that he was supposed to tell everything about himself on one date only. Silly. Same as the ending. I don't want to spoil, but what happened with Nicole was in no way funny. And it was also pretty unnecessary, one could have done it better without it."
Green Zone,2010,6.8,Discovering covert and faulty intelligence causes a U.S. Army officer to go rogue as he hunts for Weapons of Mass Destruction in an unstable region.,"I saw trailers for this movie on t.v (in Australia)...it seemed to be an action hero type movie...I actually wondered if this was the new ""Bourne"" movie for Matt Damon! Perhaps this promotional approach was due to a recent run of movies critical of the US in the current Iraq war being box-office misses. Anyway, I was prepared to watch the movie based on the trailers, but had second thoughts when the nature of the movie was mentioned on a movie review show on TV here in Australia. That nature concerned the movie venturing into the rationale of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003.So, taking a punt, I saw the movie armed with this new information. It's actually good...not depressing like movies with this type of theme can be. Not sure how much reality there is to it...it seems to cover the bases on the reasons given as to why the US invaded Iraq and the underlying reality on the ground.What's particularly interesting is how the Pentagon and the C.I.A. are depicted. No doubt there are numerous American movies where both organisations are depicted as suspect or evil. Here, one organisation comes off as acting in good faith and acting morally. Don't know enough about the war to say for certain if any US organisation can claim to have acted ethically, but this dichotomy is illuminating for the factoids it throws at the audience.If the movie does have a lot factual truth to it, then some of the events in it are truly disturbing...e.g. how the U.S. deals with people who may be able to disprove the official government line on the reasons for the war. Maybe this is just artistic license, or perhaps it's real politic as far as the U.S. goes...and anyone who has read Noam Chomsky knows that the U.S. goes all the way.I'm reminded of General Colin Powell's hand-on-the-heart moment in the U.N. where he showed satellite photos of vehicles and swore that these were mobile weapons of mass destruction delivery vehicles. Turns out that they were milk trucks...like the Iraqis said they were. It's this 'evidence' which convinced a reluctant U.N. to take the US' assertions as true and to authorise the invasion of Iraq. This movie's trailer is like General Colin Powell's moment of infamy...the trailer bears no relation to what you actually see. But it's more compelling than what the general's photo turned out to be.Matt Damon (as Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller) makes for a good lantern-jaw type hero...if such a figure actually exists, you'd think they would have have been run out of the ranks for not towing the official line. Anyway, the movie is about Miller's role in finding those elusive weapons of mass destruction that President Bush assured us were there. When he doesn't have much luck finding them, he wants to find out why..."
D√©calage horaire,2002,6.1,"A worn-out businessman and a beautician on the run collide in a Paris airport. Love arrives, all its hurdles be damned.","Dani√®le Thompson, daughter of the famous producer G√©rard Oury, wrote this comedy with her son Christopher. So making movies and writing scripts is apparently a family-mark.  She was also director of this surprising comedy with a bit of a ""Lubitsch""-touch and in the atmosphere of the movies of Claude Lelouch but with a high profiled own personality. Rose (Juliette Binoche) and Felix (Jean Reno) are characters that only could come out of the imagination of a woman. Their dialogues are well fit to their personality. Rose is a woman who is looking for real love and Felix is so busy that he has no time to even think of it. The circumstances at the airport will give them the time to know and appreciate each other. The movie shows how fate can put people together who normally never speak with each other."
Frost/Nixon,2008,7.6,A dramatic retelling of the post-Watergate television interviews between British talk-show host David Frost and former president Richard Nixon.,"I almost skipped ""Frost/Nixon,"" and I am glad I didn't. It's eminently worthwhile, one of the year's few films that deserves to be seen.My reluctance had to do with the expectation that it will offer nothing new to somebody who lived through the Watergate years and saw the Frost interviews (although remembering surprisingly little of them).Ron Howard's film is anything but ho-hum - if anything it's a bit too gussied up to be exciting. There is an element of discernible manipulation of the audience, but mostly it works, and you don't long resist it.The (relatively) unsung hero of the film besides Howard, Frank Langella's tremendous Nixon, and Michael Sheen's excellent Frost is the screenwriter: once again Peter Morgan (of ""The Last King of Scotland"" and ""The Queen"") engages mind and heart, and doesn't let go. Sam Rockwell's James Reston, Jr. and Oliver Platt's Bob Zelnick (Frost's two collaborators) are outstanding, and Kevin Bacon's Nixon-worshipping Jack Brennan is the actor's best work in a long time.Morgan and Howard manage to make the viewer think constantly of another criminal President without saying or showing anything overt - they just let history, past and present, speak.I had a strange, uncomfortable thought watching ""Frost/Nixon"": even if some future film ""humanizes"" (not excuses) Bush the way Nixon comes through this one, W. would still remain a malevolent midget against Nixon's accomplishments and actual *brain*. How far we have fallen."
August,2008,5.3,"August centers on two brothers fighting to keep their start-up company afloat on Wall Street during August 2001, a month before the 9/11 terrorist attacks.","the detractors of this movie kept looking for a beginning - middle - and end to this story (in my opinion). that's not what it's about! the story continues today.after watching this story i was most taken by the mystery of it all. it starts then ends and the in-between comes across as vacuous and self indulgent - and isn't that what the dot com bubble was all about? no where in the entire film is ""Landshark"" actually explained as to what it does. the developers do not really explain it and above all the employees seem lost as to exactly what their duties are!! and in that is the clue to this movie.it's about the grasp for fortune & fame built on a foundation that no one really understood - the internet! a quick road to cash as long as you presented yourself as if you knew what you are talking about easy cash came your way. even the elderly David bowie character fell for it but didn't care for the hartnett characters lifestyle. appearance is everything substance doesn't count.i liked this flick and will watch it again! beautifully photographed and acted - it's a thinking persons movie so don't expect the story to be handed to you."
A Lot Like Love,2005,6.6,"On a flight from LA to NY, Oliver and Emily make a connection, only to decide that they are not meant to be together. Over the next seven years, however, they are reunited repeatedly, and go from acquaintances to close friends to - lovers?","The other obvious movie that comes to mind while watching 'A Lot Like Love' is Rob Reiner's classic, 'When Harry Met Sally'. Both deal with friendship turn into romantic relationship over the years. One key difference is that this film does not focus on whether sex ends the friendship between a man and a woman. Here the two characters already have had a physical relationship from the start. It's the camaraderie that gradually develops. The physical attraction is there from the beginning and the friendship that follows only begs for the two to be together only they don't realize it. Also, 'A Lot Like Love' is more modernized and the two lead characters, Oliver and Emily, are very different from Harry and Sally. Even though it misses reaching the standard of that classic (by a bit), it remains enjoyable and manages to bring a smile. Director Nigel Cole's intentions are noble but I thought he could have done a better job with the execution. While he solely focuses on the lead pair, the supporting characters hardly have anything to do. In addition to that, the pacing isn't consistent and the ending feels abrupt. It is the casting of Emily and Oliver that is the biggest strength. Both Amanda Peet and Ashton Kutcher share the required chemistry and do an outstanding job. The supporting cast that includes familiar names like Ali Larter, Gabriel Mann and Kal Penn have too little to do to make an impression. Only Kathryn Hahn has a meatier role and she does a fine job. On the whole, 'A Lot Like Love' is a very entertaining romantic comedy, a great date movie for sure."
Identity,2003,7.3,"Stranded at a desolate Nevada motel during a nasty rain storm, ten strangers become acquainted with each other when they realize that they're being killed off one by one.","I have watched this film a bunch of times and I'm never disappointed, even though I clearly know what is going on and who is responsible!To be fair, I usually give it a year or so between viewings, just to give me enough time to be not totally sure I remember it in full. That's getting way harder now, but that's ok.It's dark, it's raining all the time, it's so corny in places you think who wrote this, a child? There's loads going on to distract you and it has a stellar cast. It's one of those films I envy people watching it for the first time.If you've not seen it, rectify that pronto! And then watch it a bunch more times to really savour it!"
Fighting,2009,5.6,"In New York City, a young counterfeiter is introduced to the world of underground street fighting by a seasoned scam artist, who becomes his manager on the bare-knuckling brawling circuit.","Dito Montiel's film has been advertised as the 'Rocky of our generation', however I do believe they were referring to the fifth film in the Rocky franchise. Predictable, boring, tedious, lifeless are just a few words I could use to describe this film, but I really only need to use one; terrible.Shawn MacArthur (Channing Tatum) is your typical working-class boy who is taken under the wing of an ageing con-man named Harvey (Terrence Howard) and given the opportunity to make his American dream come true by participating in various back-room bare-knuckle fights. Oh, and the stereotypical love-interest in the form Zulay (Zulay Henao) is also thrown into the mix. Now, despite this description describing various films from the last few years (never mind the last few decades), it contains three huge, jaw-shattering constraints: 1) Despite being named Fighting, the film ironically contains very little fighting or brawling in regards to its hundred-minute running time. And when we do get to see some face-bruising action, the Director seems to get incredibly giddy with the camera and what we are left with is some Paul Greengrass jerkiness that allows you to observe very little especially when the camera is thrown into the heart of the action.2) Terrence Howard puts a little effort into his character and drags out a performance worthy of a film better than this, however Channing Tatum does not follow his lead. His stony expression and Brando-style mumbling is just plain annoying and unconvincing, yet he is the lead protagonist at the forefront of the film, and his performance drags the film down considerably.3) Finally, Munic and Montiel's script has about as much weight as a feather and as punch as a fighter out-cold on the mat. We learn little about the characters until late into the film when there life stories seem to just be thrown around quickly to fill various plot-holes. While, the majority of the dialogue is just clich√©d and cringe-worthy, most notably a scene at the end of the film that precedes the final fight sequence, which can only be described as hilariously idiotic.Fighting is crime against cinema. It is a film which gives the audience absolutely nothing, yet takes from them their hard-earned cash in the form of their admittance fee. The only reason I can think why this film was distributed to theatres instead of being a straight-to-DVD affair, is down to the influence of having a star like Terrence Howard in the picture. Don't waste your time or money on this abomination."
My Neighbor Totoro,1988,8.1,"When two girls move to the country to be near their ailing mother, they have adventures with the wondrous forest spirits who live nearby.","Reviewers say 'My Neighbor Totoro' is celebrated for its enchanting animation and capturing childhood wonder. The film's whimsical charm, heartwarming characters, and magical elements are frequently praised. The bond between the sisters and Totoro, along with its focus on simple joys and family connections, resonates deeply. The hand-drawn animation and music enhance the atmosphere and emotional impact. Despite critiques about simplicity and lack of intricate plot, its universal themes and relatable characters make it a beloved classic."
The Passion of the Christ,2004,7.3,"Depicts the final twelve hours in the life of Jesus of Nazareth, on the day of his crucifixion in Jerusalem.","I watched first time at a special premiere for my church. We got to see it before anyone else since we saw it two days before it premiered nationwide.. To watch the reactions of my fellow church members was amazing. Many sat in stun silence, while others just bawled openly.Now, all these years later, I can say this film is still probably the most powerful, and brutally honest film that I have ever seen. If you are a Christian as I am, this film shows everything that we ever need to see about Jesus's last 12 hours, but even if you are an atheist, this film is just plain powerful in the way it was made, and created.Mel Gibson did as a Director in this film something I doubt that the great Martin Scorsese or Francis Ford Coppola, or Quentin Tarantino could never do.From the cast, to the direction, to the sets, to the costumes, I believe this is al near perfect a film as you will ever see."
Monsieur Ibrahim et les fleurs du Coran,2003,7.3,"In Paris, a Turkish shop owner befriends a Jewish boy in his mid-teens.","Seldom do I buy the book because I saw the movie. I did this time around and the book is even better than the movie albeit a bit too short, although throughout the book, you will always see Omar Sharif as Ibrahim.I went to see this without knowing too much about it and from the very beginning it succeeded in drawing me right into Rue Bleu, it was as if I could almost smell it, feel it, touch it. Why? Because we care for the characters, we feel with them, through them. Omar Sharif is just stellar as Monsieur Ibrahim and carries the story with such an ease that it is a delight to watch.One of the most powerful scenes for me was when Ibrahim confronts Momo about the stealing. There are more but I do not want to spoil it for you. ""Ibrahim"" is an emotional journey that you have to be willing to make. If you do you will be well rewarded.Highly recommendable. 9/10"
Un divan √† New York,1996,5.9,"A psychoanalyst in NYC exchanges apartments with a woman in Paris. When his patients show up, they talk to her and then pay. He returns early to NYC and becomes a patient.","""Juliette Binoche cannot act"", according to 'anonnymous' below. That isa ridiculous assertion. As is to link this film with Kieslowski's'Blue'. The problem with this movie is that neither Binoche nor Hurt aregiven the material in the form of a good screenplay nor the direction tomake the film work. It seems to me that Akerman, who is an excellentdirector, see La Captive, does not have a good enough command of Englishto write a screenplay in the language.The film, which starts out nicely quickly gets bogged down in thepsychoanalyitical. Endless ""yes"" and ""mmmmm""s loose their amusementvalue quickly. The romance angle is badly developed, just why hasBeatrice fallen for John Wire aka Henry? It doesnt work.But Juliette Binoche can act. In fact in Europe she is regarded withIsabelle Huppert to be the finest actress working today. But she canonly produce the goods when she is given the material and the carefuldirection necessary. Go rent ""Rendez-Vous"", ""The Unbearable Lightness ofBeing"", ""Les Amants du Pont-Neuf"", ""Three Colours Blue"", ""Alice &Martin"", ""The Widow of Saint-Pierre"" and especially ""Code Innconnu"" andtry arguing otherwise."
For Your Eyes Only,1981,6.7,Secret service agent James Bond is assigned to find a missing British vessel equipped with a weapons encryption device and prevent it from falling into enemy hands.,"Roger Moore returns as Bond and takes down Blofeld once again in the first 10 minutes after visiting his late wife's grave. It's a good start, but it doesn't get any better after that.A British spy ship is accidentally sunk by a mine. Its valuable communication equipment is a top prize for the Soviets. Meanwhile, a Greek tycoon is killed for unknown reasons, and Bond is assigned to investigate. He tracks down the assassin, but is killed in revenge by the tycoon's daughter Melina (Carole Bouquet).Bond goes to Cortina in the Italian Alpes. And that's where he battles the bad guys in a Bond Olympics. He skis, he ski jumps, he skis on the bobsled track, and to top it off, he fights a hockey team. It's a bit of fun action. But it makes the mistake of dropping Carole Bouquet for much of the middle. I rather have a pretty face get in on the action. And Greek hilltop villain hideout just doesn't have the explosive action needed for the climax. All in all, it's an acceptable Bond escapist adventure."
Spy,2015,7.0,A desk-bound CIA analyst volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer and prevent diabolical global disaster.,"I enjoyed this for some stress-relief. Yes, it is very vulgar quite often. But I adore Miranda Hart, Jude Law is some suave damn eye-candy, Melissa is funny as always and it was nice seeing her take on an action role. Stratham must have needed something as light relief from his usual British crime seriousness; he does idiot well, it turns out. And Rose Byrne was an adorable, lethal, spoilt brat.Just some fun. Maybe I could have done without male porn bits. That 'thing', I don't know if it was real but it was repulsive. Eww."
A View to a Kill,1985,6.3,"The recovery of a microchip from the body of a fellow British secret agent leads James Bond to mad industrialist Max Zorin, who is scheming to cause massive destruction.","""A View To A Kill"" usually gets a lot of flak, but criticizing a larger-than-life action flick (as James Bond usually is) is like criticizing a hamburger, or any other mass product. It's no Mona Lisa and it's not meant to be. And to be honest, even the Mona Lisa is not the masterpiece it's made to be. -)OK, so there are serious considerations about the film. And it's not so much that Roger Moore looks old, but rather that he *acts* old. Gone is the exuberance and youthful spirit of previous Moore Bonds. Moore seems tired and unenthusiastic, as if going through the motions, as if he doesn't care anymore. He doesn't convince.Pace-wise, there's a serious flat spot early on and it lasts for a long time. It simply is boring from the moment Bond enters the Zorin residence trying to find out about any wrongdoings and about until Tanya Roberts enters the frame. It's not helped by the plot either: ex KGB agent/ specimen turned microchip businessman trying to take over the market by blowing up Silicon Valley. It could be better, much better.What literally saves the film is the two stunning action sequences in the second half. First we got Moore and Roberts' narrow escape, leading to one of the best Bond car-chases ever. In a fire-truck of all vehicles! With Moore hanging from the extending ladder!! And then the spectacular Golden Gate Bridge sequence, brilliantly directed - is it a first for John Glen?So, among the best Bonds this is not, but a nice farewell from Mr. Moore all the same."
Live and Let Die,1973,6.7,James Bond is sent to stop a diabolically brilliant heroin magnate armed with a complex organisation and a reliable psychic tarot card reader.,"Although I have always regarded Sean Connery as the best of the actors to play Bond, I have never (unlike some Connery diehards) regarded the casting of Roger Moore as his successor as a mistake. Moore brought a different interpretation to the role, one which owed something to parts he had played in two adventure series on television, Simon Templar in ""The Saint"" and Brett Sinclair in ""The Persuaders"". Whereas Connery's tough, gritty Bond allowed something of the hard man below the surface to show through, Moore played the character much more as a suave, sophisticated English gentleman. (Connery's Bond, like the actor himself, was definitely Scottish).The villain of ""Live and Let Die"" is Kananga, the leader of the small Caribbean island of San Monique. (Shouldn't that be Sainte Monique?) For a Bond villain, Kananga's ambitions are surprisingly limited, with no scheme for world domination. He has, however, close links to the New York underworld, and has hatched a plot to flood the American market with heroin. Kananga is deeply superstitious, and employs the services of Solitaire, a beautiful young woman with the power to foretell the future through the use of tarot cards. As with a number of the other films, much of the plot of this one revolves around Bond's ability to win over the villain's female accomplice.The Bond films, of course, are all dependent upon a stylised formula involving adventure (especially chase sequences), exotic locations, beautiful women, evil villains, memorable music and a generous (but preferably not too generous) helping of humour. When all the elements of the formula come together, the result can be a highly enjoyable piece of entertainment. ""Live and Let Die"" has, by and large, got most of the elements right. Its main asset is the lovely Jane Seymour, one of the most beautiful as well as one of the most talented of the Bond Girls, as Solitaire. She was one of the youngest of the Bond Girls, being only 22 a the time the film was made (Honor Blackman and Maud Adams, for example, were both in their late thirties when they starred in a Bond film), but despite her lack of experience turns in a very good performance. Her Solitaire is not a strong action heroine like Pussy Galore or Anya Amasova, but a passive figure, melancholy and fatalistic, troubled by her psychic powers but at the same time frightened of losing them. As such she has rather more depth than the average Bond heroine.Roger Moore is also good in this film; in 1973 he was still clearly youthful enough to be convincing in the role and makes the most of it. As the villainous Kananga Yaphet Kotto is adequate, but he does rather suffer the fate of being outshone by the two secondary villains, his henchman Tee Hee (the man with the metal arm and claw for a hand ) and Baron Samedi with his demonic peals of laughter. (Curt Jurgens suffered a similar fate in ""The Spy who Loved Me"", where Richard Kiel's Jaws turned out to be more memorable than his own Stromberg). There are some exciting chase sequences, particularly the one in the old bus across San Monique, and the waterborne one through the Louisiana bayous. I didn't much care for the character of J W Pepper, a rather stupid redneck Louisiana sheriff with a thick Deep South accent who was obviously intended as the film's main comic relief. (He makes another appearance in ""The Man with the Golden Gun""). Nevertheless, there was some successful use of sardonic humour, such as the scene where a man, watching a traditional New Orleans jazz funereal, asks ""Whose funeral is it?"" and is told ""Yours"" immediately before being stabbed to death. The music was also good, especially Paul McCartney's brilliant theme song. My overall view is that this is, together with ""For Your Eyes Only"", the best of the Roger Moore Bond films. 7/10"
The Spy Who Loved Me,1977,7.0,"James Bond investigates the hijacking of British and Russian submarines carrying nuclear warheads, with the help of a K.G.B. agent whose lover he killed.","You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film and how THE SPY WHO LOVED ME rates on a scale of 1 to 10:Title: THE SPY WHO LOVED ME: The title seems more appropriate for a Harlequin Romance novel, and if suitable at all for a Bond film, it would have been a better title for ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. Yet, it does finally work the word ""spy"" into the title of a Bond film. 7 points.Pre-Credit Teaser: It's all very nicely done: Within a few minutes, we see a submarine stolen and its crew kidnapped; we meet the Soviet's top agent, who just happens to be -- surprise! -- a woman; and we get the added treat of one of Bond's greatest stunts, the great skiing-skydiving trick. A pretty cool way to kick off the film and set up the various story lines. 9 points.Opening Credits: Arguably the silliest of all of Maurice Binder's efforts, the opening sequence finds 007 bouncing around on a trampoline while various miniature, and apparently naked, babes do gymnastics on the barrels of guns. (Pity he didn't come up with that idea for THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN.) Bordering on self-parody, it is nonetheless naughty and fun and colorful and oh-so very James Bond. 9 points.Theme Song: No beating around the bush here, the song gets right to the point: ""Nobody does it half as good as you, Baby, you're the best."" Just what Bond is best at is open to interpretation. The music by Marvin Hamlisch is swanky and matched by Carol Bayer Sager's dreamy and only slightly sarcastic lyrics. And Carly Simon's vocals bring it all home. Maybe not the best Bond song, but right up there. 9 points.""Bond, James Bond"": Moore finally makes the role his. The number of smug one-liners have been trimmed, yet he still invests the character with humor -- plus some warmth and charm, and unexpected sadness. And we get to see a bit of Bond's vanity as he matches wits with a female agent who is his equal and not impressed by his stock-and-trade flirtations. Moore's best appearance as Bond. 9 points.Bond Babes: The prevailing notion has always been that ""Bond Girl"" equals ""Bimbo,"" which is only partly true. Most of the women Bond encounters are highly skilled professionals -- as well as being bimbos. But Soviet agent Major Anya Amasova, a.k.a. XXX, is the first Bond Girl to give James a run for his money. She's smart, sexy, capable, resourceful and it takes her almost the whole movie to actually fall in love with Bond. What will power! As played by Barbara Bach (a.k.a., soon-to-be Mrs. Ringo Starr), Anya ranks as one of the best Bond Girls, easily worthy of 9 points.Bond Villain: Karl Stromberg (nice villainous name, by the way) is one of those mad billionaires who hopes to create a new world order by mass genocide and building a new society, this time underwater. It is pretty much a clich√© character and unfortunately Curt Jurgen plays the part like a grumpy old man and can't seem to muster up even a maniacal laugh. 5 points.Bond Baddies: Oddjob look-a-like Sandor, played by Milton Reid, puts in an appearance long enough to die a memorable death, but it is Richard Kiel who steps into the limelight as Jaws, one of the great Bond villains. If being a hulking, seven-foot tall muscle man weren't enough, he also has steel teeth and an amazingly obsessive desire to kill 007. Playing Wile E. Coyote to Bond's Road Runner, Jaws earns 9 points.Sinister Plot: Stromberg steals a Russian and a U.S. sub, as well as a British one, with the hopes of starting World War III and destroying the civilization as we know it today. Been there, done that. 4 points.Production values: Romantic imagery, clever lighting effects and intriguing camera angles make this the most visually appealing Bond film. In the past, the emphasis was always on the most effective way to film action sequences, but here director Gilbert Lewis strives for that little bit extra as far as mood and romance. 9 points.Bonus Points: Connery had his Astin Martin and Moore gets a Lotus Esprit. It is not nearly as snazzy, but it does turn into a submarine and you never know when that will come in handy. 5 points.Summary: It had been hinted at in the three previous Bond adventures, but a new sense of style is fully apparent here. The roughness and grit that many of the purists loved about Connery's films are pretty much gone in favor of a polish and panache. Whether that is being suave or merely superficial is open to interpretation, but it does set the tone and the expectations for all future Bond adventures.Bond-o-meter Rating: 84 points out of 100."
The Man with the Golden Gun,1974,6.7,"James Bond is targeted by the world's most expensive assassin, while he attempts to recover sensitive solar cell technology that is being sold to the highest bidder.","Often cited as one of the worst James Bond films, THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN is one of my favorite of the series. Though I've seen every 007 films, some several times, I cannot describe myself as being an avid fan, so I can't be bothered with who was the best Bond and which film was most faithful to the books and which Bond girl was the best, etc. Differentiating one Bond film from the next is almost like differentiating one Twinkie from another Twinkie: simply put, it's formula film-making. With GOLDEN GUN, I can sorta see why some might think it's not up to the usual 007 extravaganza: it just doesn't follow the formula like other Bond films. There are no gadgets here and the ending is not as spectacular as other Bond flicks or some characters (the sheriff) might seem trite but of all other 007 adventures, this is the most down to earth one. I love the fact that there's no huge battle at the climax or ridiculous gadgets (the invisible car in DIE ANOTHER DAY, for example). This a Bond adventure that can actually be described as being sorta believable, which is no mean feat.What's remarkable about GOLDEN GUN is the cinematography. The composition, the natural colors, the realism of it all. I've just watched the latest DVD edition and the image is clear and beautiful. Gone is the grubby cinematography of LIVE AND LET DIE. But it's also not as super-slick as other Bond made before or after this one. It's an odd thing to cite beautiful cinematography for such a commercial project as this one. The most stunning scenes are at the end, when Bond flies to Scaramanga's secret base.The other great thing about GOLDEN GUN is casting Christopher Lee as Scaramanga. It's his best role/performance ever. And he's the best villain in any 007 film. Scaramanga is a real character, not a cartoon villain like 90% of Bond villains. The fact that the story is about two men going mano a mano is also a nice change from the tired ""villain who wants to dominate the world"" plot line. Casting Lee as Scaramanga was a stroke of genius. He's what makes THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN so memorable.Lastly, the other memorable element is John Barry's score. It's one of his most evocative for a James Bond film. When I hear it, I can't get it out of my mind.As Bond girls, Britt Ekland and Maud Adams are absolutely gorgeous. Though Adams' acting can be described as stiff, she's one of the classiest and is the saddest Bond girl ever (her actions propel the story) while Ekland is funny as the ditsy operative. The belly dancer at the beginning was, hmm, scary looking though.The film's biggest weak points are: the script, which is sorely underwritten in some spots; the re-introduction of JW Pepper character, which even if he's quite funny here, is just too improbable; and the blatant AMC product placement. The last two points almost make GOLDEN GUN ""jump the shark"" but after the excellent climax, all is forgiven.But the big glaring mistake in THE MAN WITH GOLDEN GUN, and probably the main reason why so many Bond fans don't like this film, is the fact that Bond doesn't appear before the opening credits. No kick-ass intro action scene with Bond in a jet-pack or falling out of plane without a parachute that sets the tone for the rest of the film. I have to admit that the film seems to be missing something because of that.Even so, there are still many other reasons why GOLDEN GUN is my favorite: the entire karate school scene, which is the high point of the film. The abrupt ""kick to the head"" joke was even copied years later with Indy shooting the big man with the big sword in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK; the arena scene (excellent direction there); the whole 1970s look; a confident Roger Moore who gives his best performance as 007 and says some of the funniest one liners of the series with impeccable timing. And let's not forget about Herve Villechaize as Nick Nack. He almost steals every scene he's in, which is either good or bad, depending on how you like him. In closing, THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN has just the right balance of seriousness, action, acting, exotic locations and humor."
Octopussy,1983,6.5,"A fake Faberg√© egg recovered from the body of a fellow agent leads James Bond to uncover a jewel smuggling operation led by the mysterious Octopussy, and a plot to blow up a NATO air base.","Bond again in an electrifying movie that scored a new hit in the action genre .

Moonraker,1979,6.3,"James Bond investigates the mid-air theft of a space shuttle, and discovers a plot to commit global genocide.","This is a truly great film. It has a low rating 5.2/10 and even less in others but in my opinion was the (second) most enjoyable ""Bond"" film that i have seen. I have seen all of them all except the most recent and they are all good in their own right, but this is one of the best. Not only that, but it stars Roger Moore who was the best ""Bond."" Thank-you."
You Only Live Twice,1967,6.8,"James Bond and the Japanese Secret Service must find and stop the true culprit of a series of space hijackings, before war is provoked between Russia and the United States.","My Take: Another fun Bond entry. Great Bond, fun villains, neat gadgets, and enjoyable action.""You Only Live Twice"" is business as usual for Bond. Not much new, and Connery seemed bored playing his role (explaining his disappearance in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service""). There is a lot to like in this film. Connery in ""You Only Live Twice"" is easily comparable to FROM Russia WITH LOVE and GOLDFINGER, but as Bond, he already has established that he is the best in the business and YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE does give him much to do.This film does carry the original tradition of Bond. This time around, Bond is sent to Japan to investigate the disappearances of American space shuttles. While the United States suspect it's Russian interference and threaten to retaliate, the Brits faked 007's assassination, in order to clear the way for Bond to investigate what really is going on.Some areas of YOLT are pretty campy (some of the patterns for the AUSTIN POWERS parodies are pretty evident), but the camp is part of the fun. It's a throwback to the good ol' not-to-be-taken-seriously adventure espionage fun. This is formula Bond, but loaded with great action, neat gadgetry (""Little Nellie"" is one of the most beloved Q gadgets) and the glorious sets by the one-and-only Bond veteran Ken Adam make it another high-flying, if not exactly groundbreaking, Bond adventure and one of he series' more fun entries.Rating: **** out of 5."
On Her Majesty's Secret Service,1969,6.7,"British agent James Bond goes undercover to pursue the villainous Ernst Stavro Blofeld, who is planning to hold the world to ransom.","To understand the controversy behind `On Her Majesty's Secret Service,' one must understand the events so impacting the spy genre by the time of its production in 1969.  After the back to back tremendous successes of `Goldfinger' and `From Russia With Love,' every hack producer and distributor rushed to make spy movies.  There were serious ones (`The Spy That Came in From the Cold,' `The Ipcress File'), satirical ones (`Our Man Flint,' `The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,' `Get Smart' ), and incredibly silly ones (`The Silencers,' `Last of the Secret Agents,' `Casino Royale').  `Casino Royale' was especially damaging, since it was (VERY LOOSELY) based on a Fleming novel, and used the character of James Bond, 007.  In fact, in `Casino Royale,' nearly EVERYBODY played `James Bond'.  `If we don't know what we are doing, how will the enemy,' was the explanation `James Bond' (David Niven) gave to explain why MI6 was calling all its agents `James Bond'.  To protect their franchise, the producers of the `real' James Bond movies emphasized in their promotion `Sean Connery IS James Bond.'   In a demonstration of  `gratitude,' Connery up and quit the series, leaving `On Her Majesty's Secret Service,' which was shortly to go into production, without a `Bond.'Arguably the most ambitious and difficult to shoot of ALL the Bond films (at least to that time), it's a miracle ANYTHING works in OHMSS. Much of the time it works VERY well, though the shaky underpinnings of the first hour frequently threaten to undo it.  There is so much choppy editing and dubbed dialogue, one begins to suspect he is watching a foreign film. The second hour plus works much better, all the more surprising since it was shot first. One reason may be that the film went WAY over both shooting schedule and budget, and there was enough made up `bad' press to put a great deal of pressure on the producers, first time director, Peter Hunt and star, George Lazenby.  In the middle of it all, Lazenby's publicist announced that Lazenby was not going to do another Bond (Lazenby is credible when he says that announcement was not his idea. One suspects, from the bonus material, that Cubby Broccoli planted that story to discredit Lazenby, should the film fail). Add to all this the films' tacked-on, unhappy ending (planned to be the prologue for `Diamonds are Forever'), which plays completely against the humor of earlier moments, and it's a wonder the film was NOT a dismal failure.  Quite the contrary, OHMSS is one of the BEST of the Bond films, filled with nonstop action, outstanding stunts, incredible sound, the best score (along with `Goldfinger') and a credible enough romance to lend it genuine poignancy.  Lazenby overcame many tremendous handicaps: having to replace one of the best known and popular actors in the world; he was 28, younger than  Connery when he made `Dr. No'; he was completely inexperienced as an actor  (OHMSS was Lazenby's FIRST movie, not just his first starring role); his accent (thick Australian outback) and the INCREDIBLE physical demands (Lazenby did many of his own stunts).  Considering all this, Lazenby is downright remarkable.  Certainly, in my opinion he is better than either the snooty Timothy Dalton or the lightweight Roger Moore were in ANY of their outings as Bond.. The bonus feature on the DVD concludes with strong evidence that Lazenby became a scapegoat, despite the eventual financial success of OHMSS. Lazenby, refreshingly displays no bitterness that his career nearly ended as soon as it began.  He's had a reasonably busy career playing character roles and we have OHMSS. Not a bad deal at all."
Thunderball,1965,6.9,James Bond heads to the Bahamas to recover two nuclear warheads stolen by S.P.E.C.T.R.E. Agent Emilio Largo in an international extortion scheme.,"Reviewers say 'Thunderball' excels with groundbreaking underwater sequences and Sean Connery's strong performance as James Bond. The plot involving stolen NATO atomic bombs adds high stakes. Underwater cinematography by Ricou Browning is praised, and the soundtrack by John Barry enhances the atmosphere. Despite pacing issues and repetitive scenes, the film's innovative action and memorable characters contribute significantly to the Bond franchise."
Goldfinger,1964,7.7,"While investigating a gold magnate's smuggling, James Bond uncovers a plot to contaminate the Fort Knox gold reserve.","I wouldn't put too much money on it, but in a small friendly wager, I'd be willing to bet that those who are Bond fans like Goldfinger best of all Bond films. Especially those who think Sean Connery is the best and only man whoever should have played 007.Certainly the most dangerous opponent Bond ever faced was Odd Job, who was Auric Goldfinger's bodyguard and all around assassin. I believe he was the most dangerous opponent James Bond ever fought with in all of his films. Watch that fight scene that Harold Sakata had with Sean Connery, he's got Connery almost down for the count. Fighting skills can only carry you so far when your opponent outweighs you and is built like a brick outhouse. In fact it's only sheer trickery in which Connery overcomes Sakata in a shocking conclusion.As for Gert Frobe who was Goldfinger he's the ultimate Bond villain with the ultimate plan. He's even got his men fooled who think they're going to rob Fort Knox so he can corner the world's gold supply. Actually Goldfinger plans to blow up Fort Knox with an atomic bomb and then he'll really corner the market. Of course it's up to 007 to stop him.The Bond girls are more luscious than ever with two of them, Shirley Eaton and Tania Millet meeting their demise. Eaton was the famous golden girl who Goldfinger suffocated by painting her entire body with gold paint. And of course there's Honor Blackman who switched sides do to the charms of James Bond. Who can ever forget a character name like Pussy Galore.I well remember when Goldfinger was released in 1964 just in time for the presidential campaign. The Republican candidate was Barry Goldwater that year for you young people, not alive at the time. Poor Barry was busy defending himself from charges that he would scrap Social Security, sell the Tennessee Valley Authority and lob one into the men's room at the Kremlin. So all he needed was a film to come out with a master villain with a name so similar. The Democrats had a field day spoofing the title song that Shirley Bassey made such a hit from.Without the Goldwater reference, Goldfinger is still a great action film, one of the best of Bond."
Diamonds Are Forever,1971,6.5,A diamond smuggling investigation leads James Bond to Las Vegas where he uncovers an evil plot involving a rich business tycoon.,"You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film and how DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER rates on a scale of 1 to 10:Title: DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER: A slight perversion of the once popular ad line used to sell wedding rings, this title suggests romance, but certainly that is the last thing on the film's agenda. It's a wonderfully deceptive title. 10 points.Pre-Credit Teaser: Bond ""kills"" Blofeld, which supposedly seems to tie up major loose ends from ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. But considering that when last we saw him, Blofeld was murdering James' new bride, such a confrontation should have immense power. An important turning point in the series slips past with no acknowledgment. Though the opening does serve to show that Sean Connery is back and George Lazenby has been released from Bondage. 2 points.Opening Credits: Maurice Binder's style of opening montage is wearing just a tad old and predictable. Pretty enough with its diamond-studded theme for 4 points, but not good enough to do justice to the:Theme Song: It is said that originally the film was to be a followup to GOLDFINGER, with his brother taking up where Goldfinger left off. That never came off, but certainly ""Diamonds are Forever"" is a perfect companion piece to the earlier theme song. It, of course, has the fabulous Shirley Bassey doing the vocals again, but it also repeats the cynicism of applying sensuous lust to material wealth. It's an anti-love song, much like ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend,"" only it doesn't hide its hard-edged avarice under a bouncy tune. It is, I think, even better than ""Goldfinger,"" and may be the prefect James Bond song: amoral, stylish and seductive. 10 points""Bond, James Bond"": Connery is back, a bit chunkier and a tad grayer, but apparently his extended vacation from the role of 007 paid off. Personally, I think this is his best Bond work as Sean strolls through the film with relaxed charm and a complete understanding that this film, if not the entire series, is a comedy. Bond purists tend to disregard DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER because of its flip attitude, but that is what makes it my favorite. 10 points.Bond Babes: Lana Wood, Natalie's sister, is on hand as the mandatory eye candy, and is all-too-disposable as Plenty O'Toole. But someone had the bright idea of making the main Bond Girl someone with a flair for comedy. Enter maturing starlet Jill St. John, the epitome of 1960's cheesy, Playboy sexuality. Whatever her limitations as an actress, St. John certainly had the knack for using her sexuality as an amusing toy and still maintain the edge that she is a lot smarter than she looks. As Tiffany Case, her intelligence seems to diminish as the film wears on (it seems the women Bond beds all end up dead or dumb), but her ability to fill a bikini remains indisputable. 9 points.Bond Villain: Ernst Stavro Blofeld is back again, though only his love of fluffy, white pussycats remains constant. The intense geek of Donald Peasence and the uncouth thug of Telly Savalas are replaced by Charles Gray, who opts to play the part with droll, bemused wit and -- radically -- a full head of hair. Gray never gained iconic stature as Blofeld (that would come later as the Blofeld-like narrator in THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW), but for my money he is the best Blofeld, a villain of classy arrogance who is singularly unimpressed by Bond. 10 points.Bond Baddies: Ah yes, Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint; as played by Putter Smith and Bruce Glover, they are the Chip and Dale of Bond assassins; two more gracious and well-mannered killers would be hard to find. The film has been accused of homophobia for including a pair of gay killers, but considering the sheer number of assassins to cross Bond's path, it would be more discriminatory to exclude them based on their orientation. Wint and Kidd are at once gay clich√©s and yet surprisingly non-stereotypical. Nonetheless, they glide (prance? skip?) through the film with cold-blooded assurance and a rather endearing affection. And if they aren't butch enough, there's always Bambi and Thumper (Lola Larson and Trina Parks) on hand to beat the tar out of James. 9 points.Plot: Blofeld hopes to corner the diamond market to use them on some sort of outer space laser with which he can -- again -- hold the nations of the world for ransom. Doesn't this guy ever learn? They even do the ""you've killed James Bond"" bit again. 5 points.Production values: Bond's globetrotting brings him to the glitz and pseudo-grandeur of Las Vegas in all of its tacky glory. It makes for a nicely surrealistic backdrop, appropriate for the film's self-mocking attitude -- though a major chase scene is marred by the large number of tourists standing along the route, watching the filming. 7 points.Bonus Points: The Bond producers' love of unorthodox casting pays off with the selection of country singer and sausage maker Jimmy Dean as the reclusive millionaire based on Howard Hughes. It is such a bizarre choice, yet Dean's country boy charm is a wonderful contrast to both Hughes' nutty behavior and to the bemused sophistication of Bond. 5 points.Summary: DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER is a turning point in the series; the gritty, pseudo-realism of the early films is gone in favor of slick comic book sci-fi gloss. Whatever the series loses in thrills it makes up for in fun.Bond-o-meter Rating: 81 points out of 100."
Transsiberian,2008,6.6,A Transsiberian train journey from China to Moscow becomes a thrilling chase of deception and murder when an American couple encounters a mysterious pair of fellow travelers.,"A thriller on the Trans-Siberian railway is not an everyday film premise and that is in part what makes ""Transsiberian"" interesting. It's not typical in any way unless you count the connection between murder and trains. That, and its cast is quality without seeking out big- hitting names and its director, Brad Anderson (""The Machinist"") is a fairly understated one. The story of a married couple onboard the railway and encountering something over their heads is not full of devious twists and turns, but it's attention-getting.Emily Mortimer and Woody Harrleson star as two married travelers who after going to China to do volunteer work through their church, decide to travel through Russia by train to make their trip a bid more adventurous. After all, we wouldn't have much of a film without them deciding to take the train. On board, they meet Carlos and Abby, a young couple whom they bond with, but who appear more and more suspicious as the film inches toward its first big event.Not much more can be said without giving away large chunks of the suspenseful elements of the film. It's not bland, but the intrigue of this film is summed up into just a handful of moments. Ben Kingsley, however, has a dynamite supporting role as a Russian homicide/narcotics detective. His performance is crucial to the movie's entertainment value.I would suspect a lot of people would be less than enamored with ""Transsiberian"" because it floats between suspenseful thriller and a drama about keeping secrets, telling lies and guilt. It's not pure entertainment, nor is profound with regards to the human condition. Expectation for one or the other is a recipe for not having much of a feeling about this film.I, however, found the subtlety of Anderson's film a delightful change of pace and the characters played by Mortimer and Harrelson (and the performances they give) easy to sympathize with and unique. Anderson doesn't use any familiar clich√©s in creating suspense with his film. It just builds toward its few moments and with the help of what I felt was an equally effective score from Spanish composer Alfonso Vilallonga. ""Transsiberian"" is effective in rhythm and mood, not in plot twists and profundity.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"
Alfie,2004,6.2,A cockney womanizer learns the hard way about the dangers of his actions.,"Jude Law takes the title role in this remake of the 1966 flick that was the follow-up hit that confirmed Michael Caine as a star. He's been an enduring one, still turning them out, as British actors do, whenever he's asked. 130 movies, with three n various stages of production. Good on him.But we're talking about the 2004 production, and Jude Law here. Remakes of classics always start with a disadvantage. Just as Caine undoubtedly had to contend with comparisons to Terence Stamp's performance in the original stage production (Stamp turned down the movie, and helped talk Caine into it, impelled, no doubt, by a hope that a good paycheck would get Caine out of his apartment and into his own flat). So lets get to it: Law plays a playboy, not uncaring, but happy with his life of plenty of women and no attachments, who comes to realize that's not what he wants. Caine played the same facade and base.... and then layered them with the coldness he plays so well. Law thinks he has it all; Caine brought an amount of misogynistic disdain into the mix. That might not play in the 21st century, but it's a more nuanced and interesting performance, watching Alfie's change from a cheap villain into his own victim.Still, this is a handsome production, reset in New York City for no particular reason, and offering a good time. It's not a classic, but it is a good film."
From Russia with Love,1963,7.3,James Bond willingly falls into an assassination plot involving a naive Russian beauty in order to retrieve a Soviet encryption device that was stolen by the organization Spectre.,"A chess genius by the name of ""Kronsteen"" (played by Vladek Sheybal) is also the #5 ranked member of the secret criminal organization known as SPECTRE. He has come up with a foolproof plan which includes: (1) stealing a top secret Russian decoding machine called a ""Lektor"". (2) Increasing tension between NATO and the Warsaw Pact to the point of a possible war and (3) Killing ""James Bond"" (Sean Connery) in retaliation for the death of one of their operatives named ""Dr. No"". Kronsteen convinces #1 (""Ernst Blofeld"") of his plans and #3 ""Rosa Klebb"" (Lotte Lenya) is ordered to assist him. Thinking that Colonel Klebb is still a member of SMERSH (the Russian secret service), the beautiful Russian intelligence analyst ""Tatiana Romanova"" (Daniela Bianchi) is pressed into luring James Bond to Istanbul so that he can acquire the Lektor from the Russian consulate. Once this is accomplished a ruthless assassin named ""Grant"" (Robert Shaw) is ordered to take the Lektor on behalf of SPECTRE and kill both James Bond and Tatiana Romanova. Obviously, the plot is very intricate and there are twists and turns throughout the movie, but for the sake of brevity I thought it best to end here. Overall, this is a remarkable movie which has nice cinematography, splendid acting, well-written scripts and good direction (Terence Young). Sean Connery is once again excellent as Agent 007. Pedro Armendiaz, who plays ""Kerim Bey"" (the head of Turkish intelligence), also performs admirably as does Robert Shaw. Likewise, Daniela Bianchi (a former Miss Rome and 1960 Miss World runner up) is a ravishing addition to this film as well. In short, it has the scenery, talent, script and direction that you need to make a good film and it is used to the utmost. A good James Bond film."
Taken 3,2014,6.0,"Framed for his ex-Wife's murder, Bryan Mills sets out to take revenge on the real killers.","Let's review.(Quoting from my IMDb reviews of the first two) Taken 1 was one of those unexpected surprises that keeps the wheels in Tinseltown turning. It turned Neeson, a very competent actor, into filmdom's oldest and newest action hero. A neat trick. It was actually a very well made product and even with all the attention, still under-rated. It was better than people thought.OK, to be clear. Neeson was not getting any younger and when offered Taken 2, he took it. Sorry for the pun. Taken 2 was not so much a film as an IQ test. If you thought it was in the same class as Taken 1, you failed the test. Sorry. The truth hurts.To atone for Taken 2, Neeson did the Tombstone flic. It was great and showed the world he was still an A-list actor. Apology accepted.Hollywood never ever leaves money on the table. Which brings us to Taken 3. Not really a Taken movie, more of what you would expect if they wanted to do a TV series on the Neeson character and they started with a long pilot.It is much better than Taken 2 but then again so is footage of your dog's birthday party.It is not bad. Depends on your expectations.High expectations, you will not be happy.Bored and want to spend time with Liam?You could do worse."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,2011,7.4,"Detective Sherlock Holmes is on the trail of criminal mastermind Professor Moriarty, who is carrying out a string of random crimes across Europe.","Sherlock Holmes A Game Of Shadows was a great sequel that had great slow motion scenes and awesome fight scenes.Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson did a very good job of saving the world from an evil professor named James Moriarty. Stephen Fry who played ""Mycroft Holmes"" Sherlock's brother was funny character that talks very English and he was strange sometimes. I thought that Noomi Repace who played ""Madam Simza heron"" did great job playing that character. And Jared Harris who played ""Professor James Moriarty"" was just as smart as Sherlock Holmes. And I thought the last fight scene in this movie was interesting. Sherlock and Moriaty could think different attacks on each other, that scene was intense.The train scene was awesome,Sherlock disguised as a girl was funny. Also, the running scene in the forest was great.This movie was very thrilling!"
The Grand Budapest Hotel,2014,8.1,"A writer encounters the owner of an aging high-class hotel, who tells him of his early years serving as a lobby boy in the hotel's glorious years under an exceptional concierge.","Reviewers say 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is acclaimed for its unique visual style, meticulous set design, and vibrant color palette. The film's eccentric characters, quirky humor, and intricate narrative structure are frequently highlighted. Ralph Fiennes' performance as Monsieur Gustave is often lauded for its charm and comedic timing. The ensemble cast, including Tilda Swinton and Bill Murray, is praised for their contributions to the film's distinctive atmosphere. Themes of friendship, loyalty, and the passage of time resonate with many viewers. Wes Anderson's direction is consistently commended for its creativity and precision."
Macskafog√≥ 2 - A s√°t√°n macsk√°ja,2007,5.2,"20 years after the events of the Cat Catcher, there is only one cat tribe left in Central Africa, who, after learning of what happened at the end of the first part, summon Moloch to help liberate the tamed cats and regain power over Earth.","I saw this movie, and i did not like it.The first movie was much better.I am a Hungarian, and i think Macskafog√≥ (Cat City) is the best Hungarian cartoon.I did not know, why they made a sequel to this, but i hoped, it will be good. Well, its not good.If you want to see a good Hungarian movie, than watch the first movie, because that's a very good movie, not like this one. This movie is a a shame, from the beginning to the end!I think, the director of the first movie did a big mistake, when he made a sequel to the movie."
The Monuments Men,2014,6.1,An unlikely World War II platoon is tasked to rescue art masterpieces from German thieves and return them to their owners.,"""The Monuments Men"" is a group of men (in real life around 350, and in this film 7) who are tasked with saving the historically and culturally significant monuments, fine arts and archives during World War II. They have to find and return that which the French hid and the Germans were finding and stealing and then hiding. And the film decided to tell this story comedically.The film took a really long time to get going as they wanted it to be about the men that took on this task. But they changed their names and I also couldn't tell you a single characteristic of any of them. The men were paired off so they each had their own region to investigate, but none of that was interesting. The worst part was giving James Granger (Matt Damon) and Claire Simon (Cate Blanchett, representing the real- life heroine Rose Valland) a love story. They did have a reason for such nonsense, or how about just sticking with how it actually happened.George Clooney has said the film is about 80% accurate, and that seems fair enough. But the problem isn't the historical inaccuracy; the problem is that the cheap humour diminishes the very people and story they're trying to empower. The humour was just a handful of lines wanting to kill Hitler and standing on a landmine. It just didn't make the film entertaining. The story could have done that but it didn't become interesting until they started discovering where the Germans hid the art. Coincidentally, the same point when the film started following the real story.""The Monuments Men"" very clearly wanted to help remember an important part of history and spark a debate about the cost of war on soldiers, civilians, and history and society. The debate is raging on, but the film missed the level of entertainment by not trusting its audience to be interested in exactly what happened."
The Triplets of Belleville,2003,7.7,"When her grandson is kidnapped during the Tour de France, Madame Souza and her beloved pooch Bruno team up with the Belleville Sisters--an aged song-and-dance team from the days of Fred Astaire--to rescue him.","I found ""The Triplets of Belleville"" to be one of the most charming movies I've had the pleasure of seeing the last couple of years.  This delightful movie follows the adventures of Madame Souza, her son, Champion, and their dog, Bruno.Madame Souza recognizes that something is missing from Champion's life.  His parents are, clearly, gone.  All he has left from them is a picture of the pair of them on a bicycle.  As she silently pieces together what Champion needs to be happy, she and he discover a new life as participants in the Tour de France - he as a competitor and her as his coach and trainer.They live a life of quiet, simple joys until he is kidnapped, an event that leads to a trip to Belleville for all three.  This fictional city will prove oddly familiar to most viewers.  Here, Madame Souza is befriended by the titular characters - I will leave the ""book report"" style commenting here.There are so many delights in this picture, but I am going to focus on my favorite character, Bruno the dog.  I don't think I have ever seen a movie capture a real dog as well as this one does.  We see him from a puppy, learn the event that leads him to hate trains, feel anxious for him when he paws at his bowl while the silly humans finish their own dinners, and fear for him when his canine instincts lead him to places of danger.Throughout this all, Bruno is gloriously canine.  He dreams of the things that are important to him, he sees the world as smells and images.  He is awesome.  Or, perhaps, she is awesome.  Bruno is a male name, but many have suggested he is a she.Anyhow, the other characters are great fun as well, but my heart belongs to this big fat dog.  Even if I hadn't loved the rest of the movie (I did), I would recomend it for Bruno alone."
The Hours,2002,7.5,"The story of how the novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"" affects three generations of women, all of whom, in one way or another, have had to deal with suicide in their lives.","In all honesty, as much as I liked Nicole Kidman's performance, the movie was made for me with Julianne Moore's.  She made me so nervous, has me so much on edge, cause you didn't know what the hell was wrong with her.  Did she have a crush on Toni Collette?  Did she just have a breakdown?  Does she want to burn the house down?  To the movie's credit, you don't know what exactly is wrong, until the end.  But as tense as it made me, I realized that in most movies you are clearly tipped off as far as who is angry, and why.   This movie doesn't, and I didn't appreciate that until it was over.Kidman was great, but I've always thought she had more talent than she was given credit for.  Not many people could have made ""To Die For"" so convincing.  Kudos to Nic for her career choices, post-divorce.Streep, Ed Harris and Jeff Daniels were non-entities.  I worship Streep and Ed Harris, but their part of the story didn't do a single thing for me.  I kept waiting to see if Julianne was going to drive her car off a cliff. Without having seen all the nominees in Best Supporting Actress, I'd have to say another actress would have to go pretty damn far to impress me as much as she did.  8/10."
Doubt,2008,7.5,A Catholic school principal questions a priest's ambiguous relationship with a troubled young student.,"'Doubt' has turned out to be quite a fascinating puzzle. The story is pretty much told through dialogue rather than portrayal of events. Shanley's overwhelming screenplay is so effective and the element of mystery is carried out so strongly that even the viewer is left doubting the actions of the priest and the motives of the head nun (were her accusations legitimate or was it all an intent to ruin the priest). His incredible direction takes us through the psyche of the four principle characters.Needless to say, the outstanding performances are just the necessary requirements that Shanley has successfully met. After all, who could ask for a better cast than Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams and Viola Davis? All these actors display some of the best acting of their career. It is both the dialogue delivery and the non-verbal gestures that strengthens the doubts in the viewers mind and makes the characters nonetheless more convincing.The slightly washed-out colours give the look of the 60s but also adds to the mysterious atmosphere. 'Doubt' is a very thought-provoking film. It has one questioning. Should the nun have reacted or should she have waited for evidence? But what if it was already too late for evidence? What has doubt done to them? It has them questioning themselves constantly. It has stolen their sleep. We accept that it is human to doubt but what does doubt do to us? What kind of power does it hold above us? How do we react on it? When should we react on it? The director beautifully manages to convey and provoke this without appearing pretentious or preachy."
Speaking of Sex,2001,5.6,A female marriage counselor and a male depression expert try to solve the marital problems of a troubled couple.,"This movie was similar in many ways to a French sex farce. So I guess you'll have to call this an American sex farce. The script was well thought-out, though there were a few characters which didn't get enough air time.James Spader played a neurotically geeky psychiatrist, which is a bit of a different character for him, as he usually plays sexual deviants. Good manic performances by Jay Mohr, Melora Walters, and Lara Flynn Boyle. Bill Murray and Catherine O'Hara also shown in their supporting roles. Phil Lamarr had a hilarious line, despite being only a cameo appearance.There were several intermingled stories playing all at once. It was well done because if one story started to drag, they could switch to another story to keep the interest fresh. This is really light-hearted stuff, but it did have some very subtle comic moments in places that you might miss if you don't watch it more than a couple of times, so watch it at least a couple of times."
Guardians of the Galaxy,2014,8.0,A group of intergalactic criminals must pull together to stop a fanatical warrior with plans to purge the universe.,"Reviewers say 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is an entertaining Marvel film with humor, adventure, and standout performances by Chris Pratt, Bradley Cooper, and Vin Diesel. The 70s and 80s soundtrack is acclaimed, though some find the plot predictable and character development shallow. The humor is divisive, and the villain receives mixed reactions, but the film generally offers a fun experience."
"I, Frankenstein",2014,5.1,"Frankenstein's creature finds himself caught in an all-out, centuries-old war between two immortal clans.","Aaron Eckhart is cast as Frankensteins' Monster in this elaborate but so-so screen adaptation of the graphic novel created by Kevin Grevioux. (Grevioux also co-stars, as an imposing henchman named Dekar.) After the deaths of both Elizabeth and Victor F., The Monster is soon attacked by Demons. He learns that there's been a war waging for centuries, between Gargoyles (the good guys) and these aforementioned Demons (the baddies). The Monster also learns that there's a head Demon named Naberius (Bill Nighy) who wants to learn Victors' big secrets of creating life. He / it tries to live a solitary existence, but realizes that he WILL have to get involved in this war.I'll join the chorus of people who attempt to defend this movie, at least to some degree. Yeah, it's cut from the same cloth as a lot of other modern horror / fantasy / action hybrids such as the ""Underworld"" series. It doesn't tell a particularly innovative or interesting story, but it is at least an entertaining one. Enough so that this viewer wasn't constantly checking his watch, anyway. It features a truly over the top Gothic look, and some passable makeup, but some viewers will surely be turned off by the plethora of digital effects.Eckhart leads the way, and does a creditable job, delivering a performance of both intensity and physicality. Filmed in Australia, much of its cast are native Aussies, and they do bring a certain gravitas to the material. Nighy has had better material, to be sure, but he's a perfectly suitable lead villain here. Yvonne Strahovski (as Terra Wade, a scientist in Naberius' employ), Miranda Otto (as the Gargoyle Queen), and Caitlin Stasey (as Keziah the warrior) are all extremely easy on the eyes, which doesn't hurt any. It's nice, as it always is, to see Bruce Spence of ""The Road Warrior"" fame, on screen; that face of his is instantly recognizable.""I, Frankenstein"" is slick, and forgettable, but not an entirely empty experience, as it does have some humanity and sense of purpose.Six out of 10."
Antichrist,2009,6.5,"A grieving couple retreat to their cabin in the woods, hoping to repair their broken hearts and troubled marriage, but nature takes its course and things go from bad to worse.","Controversial, much lauded and horrific to watch, ANTICHRIST is Lars von Trier's showpiece film. It tells the tale of an unhappy marriage that breaks down due to grief, and the extremes that follow. It's a film that plays out as a two-hander for the most part, with Dafoe and Gainsbourg acting it up in a remote woodland cabin and taking out their rage and anger upon each other.The film's simple storyline allows von Trier to concentrate on the things that interest him most. His intelligent, thoughtful script goes deep into the psyche of his characters, exploring the ways in which therapy can ‚Äì and in some ways, cannot ‚Äì help a parent to get over the loss of their child. The first half of the film is packed with foreboding that gives way to visceral horror in the second half.Everything you've heard about this film's explicit nature is true; nothing much makes me squeamish anymore, but ANTICHRIST did. I can't stand sexual violence in films and von Trier incorporates it to chilling, disturbing effect, made all the more powerful due to its brief nature. In many ways, the second half of this film becomes HOSTEL in the woods, except it's all the more frightening because violence comes from a loved one rather than a stock villain.Dafoe and Gainsbourg are both very good; they couldn't not be, seeing as what von Trier asks of them. Dafoe plays the more sympathetic role and Gainsbourg's character is a little shrill on occasion, but neither of them disappoint. Von Trier directs in classic art-house style with beautiful shots interspersed with grotesque imagery and true left-of-field interludes.It's certainly not a film for the faint of heart or an experience I would choose to put myself through again, but I think that ANTICHRIST is a great example of a director following his vision without compromise."
Tears of the Sun,2003,6.6,A Special-Ops commander leads his team into the Nigerian jungle in order to rescue a doctor who will only join them if they agree to save 70 refugees too.,"As a person who can speak from a reputable stand point, I have to say this movie is different than many other ""war"" movies and is generally regarded highly among many different types of members in the U.S. military. This films representation brought forth a perspective that showed a few sides to a mission. Yes there is the desire to finish and get out. But the film also showed that the situation can change on the ground as it always does, and sometimes you have to modify. An seasoned veteran like Lt. Waters who is somewhat seasoned being a Lt. probably would have the foresight to say it is safe to go ahead and try and get these people to a border being that was the only way to drag the doc outta there without hog tying her, even though the orders above were different. A team leader is expected to use some discretion and Lt. did that. Although it was borderline crazy operationally it still worked. Working in that environment is not just like a round of socom. Things happen and you have to do the best you can for the situation if it is feasible and you have the balls to do it. Also, the depiction of the action scenes were practically dead on and impressive. Mr. Fuqua didn't cheese it up, it was kept fairly raw and confusing as is a real engagement. The ethnic cleansing scenes, well it doesn't get any more realistic than that. I can understand why everyone else hates America for doing these films about ourselves but honestly can you see a french film showing specwar going into save a village, nope. They would hand out white flags to everyone. Maybe the Aussies, Israelis, or Brits, but pretty much beyond those three countries thats all ya got. If at the least, this is a reminder that even when you think you know about what our guys are doing in the world, you don't know the half,we lose guys everyday and people should realize that a silent war exists."
Hunger,2008,7.5,Irish republican Bobby Sands leads the inmates of a Northern Irish prison in a hunger strike.,"Hunger (2008) ****Bobby Sand's story has been told before on screen, but never with such raw intensity and unrelenting artistry as in Hunger. The film is directed by Turner Prize winning artist Steve McQueen. While his art has often been part of the film medium, this is his first entry into feature film-making.The film sparked both controversy and applause at this years Cannes Film Festival, with both disgusted walkouts and rousing ovation. It the end it landed McQueen the Camera D'or.While the film follows the final weeks of Bobby Sand's hunger strike, it is equally about recreating the atmosphere and conditions inside the infamous Long Kesh Maze Prison. Its nearly a half hour into the film before we even meet Sands, in fact. We're introduced to a prison guard, who outside nervously checks his car for bombs, quietly avoids his comrades, then becomes as vicious as any other when brutalizing the inmates. We're also first introduced to a new inmate, who, as per the IRA standard, refuses to war a uniform and instead goes simply wrapped in a blanket. He and his cellmate smear the walls of their cells in feces as part of the no wash protest.Bobby is played by Michael Fassbender, who gives a quietly powerful performance. For the film he underwent a medically supervised crash diet, one rivaling - if not outright surpassing - that of Christian Bale in the Machinist. He moves throughout the film with a sense of determination and dedication.It is difficult to go into any detail about plot, as the film more or less moves patiently and quietly towards the inevitable. And the key word may be quiet. McQueen claimed that he originally envisioned doing the film dialogue free. Indeed, much of Hunger is free of dialogue. However, McQueen, as he puts it, felt it would be more powerful to go from vocal silence into an avalanche of dialogue. And so the films centerpiece was born - a 20 minute stationary shot of Bobby speaking with his Priest. In a film that is filled with a dark heaviness in a cruel prison atmosphere, that meeting lifts a weight for a time, before slowly descending into a sad sense of inevitability. Though that inevitability is liberating, it is nonetheless a profoundly sad one. The film also does not shy away from the cruelty of the British towards the Irish, though it also does not deny the brutality of the IRA at times - as characterized in one shocking moment. However, anyone with any inkling of rational knowledge on the Irish struggles knows that the IRA was never simply a terrorist organization, but a rebel group that did from time to time employ terrorist tactics. Like all anti-state organizations, however, the IRA did not exist for the sake of conflict, but because of callousness and cruelty. McQueen reminds us of the cruelty and arrogance of the British particularly through the cold words of Margaret Thatcher, speaking shamelessly about Sands' strike.There have been many fantastic films about the Irish Struggles, with some of the best coming in recent years (Ken Loach's fantastic Wind that Shakes the Barley, and Paul Greengrass's Bloody Sunday, to name two of the better). This one, I think, may be the best. At least from an artistic and purely visceral standpoint. McQueen captures his scenes in jarring compositions, with all the skill and artistic imagining of a true artist. From the opening sequences, Hunger promises something more than just the standard. Whereas most political films focus all their attention on the message, Hunger focuses on the feeling, and never strays from its artistic goals. This is art, from its opening to closing frames. It's a boldly crafted and brave film. The cinematography and direction are assured, moving slowly and unexpectedly, always beautifully even in its darkest and dirtiest moments.I believe this truly is a great masterpiece. McQueen has proved himself as a masterful artist of film-making as well with Hunger."
Finding Forrester,2000,7.3,"Forrester, the author of a famous book, decides to help Jamal, a 16-year-old student, discover his writing prowess by mentoring him and enrolling him into a prestigious private school.","September 2004.... While walking through the aisles of Blockbuster in search of films my wife and I may have missed through the years, we stumbled on ""Finding Forrester"". I had a slight recollection of a recommendation from a friend some time ago. In a nutshell, we really enjoyed this film. Both main characters are charming and convincing. The story makes you think and is clever. If you liked ""Good Will Hunting"" you will probably like this movie too, since it has a similar flavor to it. Though the film is 4 years old, the story is timeless and worth watching. Enjoy, Jimmy"
The Tree of Life,2011,6.8,"The story of a family in Waco, Texas in 1956. The eldest son witnesses the loss of innocence and struggles with his parents' conflicting teachings.","For a concise summary of what to expect from this film I can't do better than direct you to Rooprect's review.When I saw Tree of Life I think I was fortunate in that I knew absolutely nothing about it beforehand. All I knew was the title, and I'd briefly seen the enigmatic poster for it. But who was in the cast or who directed it, etc, I knew not. So I went in completely open minded.I also timed the cinema visit so I missed all the ads and trailers - I'm not saying this necessarily improved the viewing, but the nature of the movie is at a polar opposite to all that commercial stuff, and it was good not to be distracted by that crap.Turned out: It really was a memorable film, and I won't forget that couple of hours in the cinema watching it, it felt like a rare treat. Very enjoyable experience, but a film completely outside the usual Hollywood fodder of an Odeon or Vue."
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,2009,6.0,"Sam Witwicky leaves the Autobots behind for a normal life. But when his mind is filled with cryptic symbols, the Decepticons target him and he is dragged back into the Transformers' war.",It's my least favorite of the franchise but I still had fun with it. One really intense fight sequences i really liked. The other fights we're ok. Wish there was a lot more in the movie. Watch it for yourself. Don't buy the hate for this franchise.
Dogville,2003,8.0,"A woman on the run from the mob is reluctantly accepted in a small Colorado community in exchange for labor, but when a search visits the town she finds out that their support has a price.","This is probably the most shocking movie experience I've ever had, not only because of the emotional impact, but because this is truly a moral-horror movie that slapped me in the face.The film is probably one of the best moral tales ever told, in which Nicole Kidman and all the supporting cast shined. Why did the makers try to make it look incomplete? Why haven't they used more sophisticated production set rather than some made-believe structures directly exposing the film studio's interior environment to you? I didn't get it at first, thinking this might just be another pretending piece of crap that tried to be ""artistic"".However as the story proceeded, the whole thing started to make senses. Featuring some of the best character study I've ever seen, the story involved you into the adventure of Grace, the main protagonist who's supposed to be despised by us logically and naturally. Then, the audiences were forced into a game that the filmmakers keep you guessing what would happen the next, until the very end.The ending, in my opinion, is the most shocking and frightening ending ever seen in a film. Dogville is by no means marketed as a horror movie, but if one believes himself/herself to have the moral high ground, he or she should stand the test the movie has given us. For me, I chose to live with all the miseries happened to Grace and play along just like every other character in the story, ""sh!t happens"" as they say. This, has not only put me in shame but also freaked me out at the end. Considering the potential spoilers I would caused, I'd suggest you go see it for yourself.With superb acting, very well plotted story and a shocking message for senseless societies, Dogville is easily a masterpiece."
All the Pretty Horses,2000,5.8,"Two Texas cowboys head to Mexico in search of work, but soon find themselves in trouble with the law after one of them falls in love with a wealthy rancher's daughter.","May contain mild spoilersAll the pretty horses is a movie based on a Cormack Mc Carthy novel by the same name. I read the novel after I had seen the movie because I wondered why the movie left me so empty inside after watching it. I couldn't say that it was bad but I couldn't' find the passion and depth I usually find in Mc Carthy's work. The funny thing is that even after having read the book I couldn't find an instant explanation why the movie didn't work. The director didn't leave anything out and yet, the magic of the book was ""lost in translation"".I will try to name some possible reasons:1.The first thing that strikes me is the age difference. Matt Damon- though young looking-plays a teenager of 16,17 years. He can't hide the fact that he's over ten years older. Since one of the main themes of the movie is the coming of age, it doesn't work because the main protagonists are already grown up.2.A second problem is Mc Carthy's poetic language that is totally neglected in the visualization. A director should know how to transfer the poetry of words into pictures. It's not impossible ‚Äì many have successfully done it. If he can't do it, he should pick another type of genre to direct where poetry isn't needed.3.There are some recurrent motives in the book like the guilt (and responsibility) the main protagonist feels for the death of a young boy. A second important motive is his respect for parental figures because he never had a real one. Unfortunately in the movie everything is told with the same pace ignoring to underline important motives or set priorities. The director seems to have one universal stylistic device and that is showing horses in all possible variations. It is just not enough."
The Money Pit,1986,6.4,A young couple struggles to repair a hopelessly dilapidated house.,"Richard Benjamin, actor (Westworld, 1973) goes director, directed this entertaining film fun about a down-on-his-luck couple desperately fighting for the survival of their relationship while the roof over their heads - and their bank account - slip into an increasingly precarious predicament.With Tom Hanks and Shelley Long prominently cast, both have convincing chemistry in this classic piece reminiscent of comedies of the '50s and '60s.The humor comes more with slapstick interludes and is very physical. The film is very entertaining and diverting.A compelling good-mood film with a young Tom Hanks."
The Libertine,2004,6.2,"The story of John Wilmot, a.k.a. the Earl of Rochester, a 17th century poet who famously drank and debauched his way to an early grave, only to earn posthumous critical acclaim for his life's work.","'The Libertine' is a dark period drama that reminds one of Shakespearean tragedies. It can be watched as a wonderful character study as it takes a look at the Second Earl of Rochester during the Restoration period. He's a poet, a playwright and a tormented soul. He's a talented man but he's someone that dislikes life and his actions push 'cultural boundaries' that earn him more hatred from surrounding folks. We see in the initial stages of the film that he appears to be alright with being hated by so many but one thing, or person, changes it all...but perhaps it's too late for him.Director Dunmore does a very impressive job of capturing the atmosphere of the time. The foggy melancholy, the brown poverty and the graying rot are some gloomy effects that finely contribute to this tragic piece. The costumes, lighting and set designs add to the gloominess. Though 'The Libertine' is a tragedy, it's filled with dark witty humour. The Earl's desire to have a painting with a monkey, the first scene at the bar and some of scenes between The Earl and Alcock are examples of such. However, Dunmore neglects many crucial parts of Wilmot's life which could have made the film and the character more interesting e.g. how much he loved his children and country, his relationship with his wife was very much a loving one etc...there are lots of historical inaccuracies.Depp is both sublime and enigmatic and he brings the subtle humour and his character's torment, ambivalence and weakness with √©lan. One wonders why this performance didn't get as much recognition for in my humble opinion it's one of his best among the so many variety of wonderful characters he's articulately played. Samantha Morton indeed has a strong presence and of course delivers a fabulous performance. John Malkovich is adequate. It was great to see Richard Coyle and Jack Davenport in comedic roles that are upside downs of the characters they play in the famous sitcom 'Coupling'. Coyle is particularly effective as the Earl's loyal servant. Kelly Reilly does well in a small role and Rosamund Pike deserves special mention for giving her best performance and having a remarkable presence within an admirable cast.'The Libertine' beautifully starts with a haunting monologue and ends with a sad one. It is a phenomenal study of a complex man, a man who rejected what he received but never got what he wanted. A superb film."
The Stranger,1946,7.3,An investigator from the War Crimes Commission travels to Connecticut to find an infamous Nazi.,"The IMDb trivia page says this is Orson Welles's least favorite and least personal film. Aside from ""Citizen Kane"" and ""The Magnificent Ambersons,"" I think this potent film noir is his most enjoyable‚Äîcertainly more so than the ugly ""Lady from Shanghai"" or the overbaked and convoluted ""Touch of Evil.""Charles Rankin (Orson Welles) is a professor in a respectable Connecticut town about to marry the daughter of a U.S. Supreme Court justice. But his name is fake and his past is filthy. An earnest convert to Christianity (Konstantin Shayne), who once ran a Nazi concentration camp, is capable of exposing him. ""Rankin"" kills this little old man and buries his body in the forest. But he isn't safe because an investigator (Edward G. Robinson) from the War Crimes Commission is on his tail. Rankin needs his own wife (Loretta Young) to help him elude capture. But his fascination with the local clock tower may prove his undoing.As a director, Welles strains a bit too hard for effect in this film‚Äîand much too hard in everything but ""Kane"" and ""Ambersons."" In those two films all of his technical effects, striking as they are, seem effortless and exactly the right choices. Here, he has imperfect moments‚Äîsuch as the scene where his character is frantically, and inexplicably, trying to pick up pieces of paper‚Äîbut everything else is splendid, especially the climax.As an actor he's always compelling, but I think he makes one bad choice here. He's too guilty-looking in the early scenes. It makes us wonder why no one suspects him; and it robs us of a dramatic contrast when he begins to realize he's in imminent danger.Loretta Young is generally a dull actress. She doesn't have enough skill to make an impression in the early scenes; but once the part requires histrionics she performs her duties well enough. Certainly her character is morally dubious and therefore fascinating in itself.The best performance by far is Edward G. Robinson's. One of the great actors of his time, this ugly man has enough talent and star quality to underplay his role to great effect.Orson Welles fans might find this exciting, well-plotted thriller too un-Wellesian to suit them. Otherwise, this is highly recommended."
Don Juan DeMarco,1994,6.7,"A psychiatrist must cure a young patient who presents himself as Don Juan, the world's greatest lover.","Unless you understand these 4 secrets, you will miss what the film is all about:1.  The film is NOT about Don Juan !2.  The film tells us how to rekindle love in our lives, even if we are old and gray-haired.   This is so very important!!3.  If we do not have a good dose of fantasy, of rich imagination, of beautiful dreams in our lives, then we will become 'burned out' by the harsh boredom of reality-as-we-perceive it. We are also challenged by the question ""What really is real?""4.  If we have too much fantasy and not enough reality, then we cannot cope with the rest of the world. Also, society will not be able to cope with us and we will be isolated, perhaps in a mental institution or at least in our own twisted world.Oh - did I say that this film is not about Don Juan?  Well, in a sense, I lied. It is and it is not.  See the film and think about it.Superbly well acted by Johnny Depp, Marlon Brando, and Fay Dunaway (what an incredible beauty even at her age!). An amazing script and a very original story.  Unless you understand the meanings above, or if you have a cold heart, you'll probably rate it a 5 or 6.I give it a 9 out of 10!!"
Manderlay,2005,7.2,"A story of slavery, set in the southern U.S. in the 1930s.","I watched Manderlay in the run up to the Presidential Election. I was moved by it. The film is certainly topical with two weeks to go before we have the opportunity to possibly elect the first African-American President. I believe to do so would make statement to the people of the world that this experiment we're conducting with Freedom can work. What it has taken to get us to this point has been harrowing. This nation fought a Civil War, which helped to put an end to the institution of slavery. But there has been constant slippage (a polite word for the continued institutional racism) that led to the need for legislation to correct injustice. The Civil Rights era is now past and still racism continues. Blacks have had to continue to put their lives on the line to expand the Rights due them. We might now though witness the election of a black man as President. Racism will not end as a result of course but what a leap forward. It has taken the disaster of the past 8 years to get the country to the place where this is even possible. No W, no Obama.Von Triers makes demanding films. I understand some people's aversion to his use of a sound-stage in both Manderlay and Dogville. It took me a bit of time in Dogville to adjust to the artifice. For me though, making the adjustment brought the issues and ideas he's dealing with to central focus in the film. No need for a real plantation in Manderlay. But the continuing enslavement does go on and it goes on in the film in the plantations of our mind. It goes on despite Grace's attempts to correct people's behaviors and beliefs and end the racism. We don't seem able to end it in this nation either.Overall IMDb users have been much kinder to Manderlay than the critics have been. Many, perhaps a majority of the negative comments, take exception to the fact that Lars von Trier is a foreigner and worse yet a foreigner who has never set foot on American soil. That is not a problem for me. I have never been in Germany but I know that what happened in Germany and Europe in the 30's and 40's was wrong, was evil. My opinion as a non-German about the Holocaust and the war itself should not, cannot be discounted. It is probably more valuable for the German people to have a sense of what their actions created but am I not allowed to speak to those issues? Am I oversimplifying here? Perhaps.I think, in some ways, von Trier's not being an American gives him some needed objectivity. I found the racial issues raised in Manderlay, to go to the heart of how racism works in this country. And right now in the United States of America we are witnessing a nation having to face it own demons concerning race once again. Many may not be able to vote for Barack Obama for no other reason that he is a Black Man. Many of those people will find another rationale for their vote.I am glad I watched Manderlay at this time. It really does deal with some very crucial issues we as a nation have not always successfully faced. We have a chance to do something new but we need some clarity of vision about what we stand for as Free People. I feel Manderlay did a good job in helping clarify for me how we're all in this together. This was not an easy film for me to write about and I apologize for the political nature of what I have written."

The car has a mind of its own and Jim starts winning with it. Thorndyke wants the car back.Jim could be nicer especially to Carole and Tennessee in the first half. Once he finally recognizes Herbie, the team is pulled together. It becomes more fun like the big car race. It's a classic Disney live-action joyride."
Mary Poppins,1964,7.8,"In turn of the century London, a magical nanny employs music and adventure to help two neglected children become closer to their father.","Julie's film debut began the world's love affair with her--and what a marvelous vehicle for doing so. Julie appears here in fine voice and is radiantly beautiful.The performance is more than deserving of the Oscar, especially considering that she had to act to blue screens and objects/characters from within her imagination. No easy task, certainly.I also love the way Julie, as Mary, refuses to acknowledge the free-for-all that is going on around her. She simply pushes her hair primly back in place and presses on, despite the dancing chimney sweeps and giggling uncles that surround her. ""I never explain anything,"" she blithely comments.The score is one of my favorites in all the Disney canon. The Sherman brothers outdid themselves with ""Stay Awake,"" one of the most under-appreciated lullabys ever written, and the hauntingly winsome ""Feed the Birds.""The Disney animators have created a visual feast as bottomless and surprising as Mary Poppins' carpetbag. The Peter Ellenshaw matte shots are breathtaking. My favorite visual moments? Bert and Mary's live-action reflections in a pond are eddied by a family of cartoon geese. I also love when Bert, Mary, and the children ascend a staircase constructed only of chimney smoke. Brilliant!There are a few drawbacks: The film's a little over-long, especially in the final third where Mary's but an afterthought in all the plot resolution. In addition, Van Dyke was an excellent choice for his singing and dancing (and popularity), but his cockney accent does grate after a while.But all in all, this is a tour de force for all involved!"

Heisei tanuki gassen ponpoko,1994,7.2,A community of magical shape-shifting raccoon dogs struggle to prevent their forest home from being destroyed by urban development.,"Most anime fans remember Isao Takahata best for his wonderful tearjerker, ""Grave of the Fireflies"", will find interesting this title as well. This lavishly animated tale about raccoons battling for their homeland isn't so dramatic as ""Grave of the Fireflies"" but is an interesting amalgam of humor, drama, and action delivered instead. At times, the viewer gets treated to scenes which recall the tragic elements , but even though the tone of the movie is somber, a handful of lighthearted moments elevate the overall production out of depression.As this is a Studio Ghibli film, production values are spectacular. Backgrounds are painted with a tasteful mixture of simplicity and art, and the raccoons are as cuddle-some as you would expect. (If you're scratching your head while reading this, don't be alarmed--according to Japanese folklore, raccoons have the power to transform into anything--including human beings) The actual animation is as colorful and imaginative as you might expect from a Ghibli movie(and there is one scene where we are treated to cameo appearances by Porco Rosso, Kiki, and Totoro.)While Pom Poko has a story to tell and a meaningful message for one to think about, its character and plot aspects may come across as a bit off-putting to viewers expecting a typical animated feature. Indeed, while some raccoons identify themselves with distinguishable names and/or personalities (for example, Gonta is a burly, rough-and-ready raccoon who is always looking for a fight, while Oroku is the ""wise woman"" of the tribe), the story offers little in the way of character development. In fact, most of the action in the story is narrated (by Maurice LaMarche in English, Kokondei Shinchou in Japanese), which elevates the overall effect of the movie to that of a semi-documentary. For the most part, this approach works to a very interesting degree and is a refreshing change of pace. However, there were some scenes in the movie where I wished the narration could have been reduced a little bit, as it sometimes gets in the way of appreciating the beauty of the visuals on screen.Unfortunately, most of the attention that this movie received were some silly controversies about the fact that the movie shows the testicles of the male raccoons, but that was a minor detail if you compare with the charm and the originality of the story. Even when it is not perfect (Some consider this movie a inferior work of Ghibli )this movie was funny enough for me, and is one of the my favorite animes."
Babe,1995,6.9,"Gentle farmer Arthur Hoggett wins a piglet Babe at a county fair. Narrowly escaping his fate as Christmas dinner, Babe bonds with motherly border collie Fly and discovers that he too can herd sheep. But will the other animals accept him?","I'm surprised that none of the reviews I read of Babe (there are 146 of them) mentioned the music. How can you watch this and not be moved by the terrific use of music? Well, quite simply, you can't I think. Still it seems that no one is consciously aware enough of the music to even mention in their reviews. Just today, I heard the 4th movement of Camille Saen Sans 3rd Symphony, the ""organ symphony"", and immediately I was reminded of the movie.Yes, the movie was very good. Good story, good actors, great use of animals to portray the main characters. But if you look at the IMDb listing for the movie, way, way, down at the very bottom, there's a link to the ""soundtrack"". I suggest you check it out to see what else makes this movie so good.

""Charlie St. Cloud"" is just that, a romantic drama, nothing more and nothing less.There is nothing profound, although with a few thoughtful dynamics, it's just the story of a young man (Zac Efron) unable to overcome the tragic death of his younger brother until he meets a beautiful girl who shares his same passion for sailing.The problems are plentiful, with cringe-worthy dialogue, supporting actors who haven't yet learned how to act, no affecting drama producing few tears, and there just isn't enough to completely hold your attention. But yet, because it's a simple love story that doesn't pretend to be grandiose and doesn't force out-of-place tears, I liked ""Charlie St. Cloud"". I found it to be sweet, subdued and modest.It was also the perfect choice for Zac Efron as he matures in his acting career. Sure, there are probably a few too many shots of Efron standing in his jeans and t-shirts staring into the sunset with his longing, blue eyes, but that is, of course, partly why we would watch it in the first place."
Filth,2013,7.0,"A corrupt, junkie cop with bipolar disorder attempts to manipulate his way through a promotion in order to win back his wife and daughter while also fighting his own inner demons.","This is another film adaptation of an Irvine Welsh novel that was referred to as ""unfilmable"", although when reading the book when it first came out I for one was struck by the tightness of the narrative and the cinema-friendly focus on a single protagonist.The antihero in question is Bruce Robertson (James McAvoy), a dodgy copper trying to make the most of a promotion opportunity by ruining his rivals through a series of cruel intricate schemes. Meanwhile, his mind is deteriorating, and he's haunted by flashbacks, waking dreams, and humanoid livestock. The film is fairly faithful to the source, and the changes (including some understandably blunted edges) are down to the different artform.Irvine Welsh has said that McAvoy's performance is better than De Niro's in Taxi Driver. I don't think this is a suitable comparison. Scorsese's seminal feature was about a post-traumatic depression, whereas Jon S. Baird's film is more manic. For me, the film Filth most resembles is A Clockwork Orange. Like Kubrick's masterpiece, the entire aesthetic is informed by the subjectivity of the central character. And there are subtler nods: the use of classical music, the bleached windows, Jim Broadbent's reinvention of the Deltoid character (a probation officer then, a psychiatrist now), and the visual reference to 2001: A Space Odyssey.Before the film's release, I wasn't convinced by the casting of McAvoy, but after watching it I can safely say he's transformative ‚Äì to capture such bipolar savagery and the fear in a single facial expression is the sign of a special performance. The supporting cast provides a colourful blend of caricatures. Jamie Bell, Eddie Marsan and Imogen Poots all make an impact in the few moments when McAvoy isn't dominating the screen.For me, the dud notes concern the tone of the film. Sometimes Baird's shifts between the schizoid black comedy of Robertson's outbursts and his introspective guilt about his past are so sudden and sentimental that their capacity to convince is lost in the (lack of) transition. Part of this is down to Clint Mansell's disappointingly soft score, whose tinkly piano and lifeless strings often feel incongruous, more awkward than deliberate.But these minor issues don't detract from a powerful, funny, and finally moving depiction of mental disintegration. To say that it's the best Welsh adaptation since Trainspotting may not be saying much ‚Äì so I'll say instead that it's a very good film in its own right."
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,2015,6.2,"Tris Prior must confront her inner demons, and with help from those closest to her, continue the fight against a powerful alliance that threatens to tear her society apart.","My brother and I are fans of the books and we generally enjoyed the first film. However, this film doesn't amount to either. Sure, the visuals aren't bad, I especially like the look of the film and the action wasn't bad. The big problem with this is mostly just the storyline. It just seems quite bland.That's really all I can say. This film is just bland."
The Imitation Game,2014,8.0,"During World War II, the English mathematical genius Alan Turing tries to crack the German Enigma code with help from fellow mathematicians while attempting to come to terms with his troubled private life.","Brilliant adaptation of the story of Bletchley Park and the cryptanalysis team, ran by Alan Turing, that cracked the code of the German Enigma Machine during World War II. Featuring an outstanding starring performance from Benedict Cumberbatch as war hero Turning and supporting acts from a brilliant cast including Keira Knightley, Charles Dance and Mark Strong, 'The Imitation Game' is a powerful and eminently well-made biopic that illuminates the facts whilst respecting the story it is based upon. The English-language debut of 'Headhunters' director Morten Tyldum, this British World War II thriller is a highly conventional story about humanity that creates a fascinating character, anchored by a hypnotically complex performance."
Equilibrium,2002,7.3,"In an oppressive future where all forms of feeling are illegal, a man in charge of enforcing the law rises to overthrow the system and state.","First of all, a extremly tought provoking film!Definitely a great film that really captures the essence of what makes us human. And how we need to protect freedom, democracy and culture forever.I really think it manages to capture the human mind and the human experience of life and society.Christian Bale fits perfectly for this role capturing his classic performances and abilitys as a actor during these ""cold"" roles he usually does.Soundtrack is amazing!Amazing script and filming aswell!What makes my rating abit lower, from being a stable 8 or 9 is the exaggerated actionscenes that takes too much space.Otherwise then that, its a movie that everyone should watch to understand how dangerous power could be and that we need to fight for freedom every day."
John Carter,2012,6.6,A war-weary former army captain is inexplicably transported to Mars and reluctantly becomes embroiled in a conflict of epic proportions.,"What source of magic is this,i can't feel my body am i numb i cant stop shouting this is too good.Never judge a movie by its poster cause i never felt that coming like whow.Ahh i really enjoyed and engaged well with this movie as for time it was well spent here."
Gangster Squad,2013,6.7,"It's 1949 Los Angeles, the city is run by gangsters and a malicious mobster, Mickey Cohen. Determined to end the corruption, John O'Mara assembles a team of cops, ready to take down the ruthless leader and restore peace to the city.","In 1949, gangster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) is taking over L.A. from the Chicago mob. Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) is leading a squad to destroy his organization by any means necessary. Grace Faraday (Emma Stone) is Mickey's girl, and she falls for the charming Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling).There is no subtlety in this movie. It's just style, violence, and 2-dimensional acting. The style is over the top. So it the violence. And the acting is as cartoonish as a comic book. The story is a straight forward shootout. This is not the 'The Untouchables'. It is more like a comic book version. That's part of its charm. It doesn't matter that the characters are simplistic. It just matters that they shoot a lot."
East Is East,1999,6.9,"In early 1970s England, a Pakistani father finds the authority he has previously maintained challenged by his increasingly Anglicized children.","¬ÑEast is East"" is a refreshing inventive family story. Directly the first scene where two different religions and also two opposing views of life (namely the children's and the view of their conservative father) clash together. With the funny way of telling which is typical for the whole film, nevertheless the problems are shown in their graveness. The cast represents every member of this Pakistani family as an individual but the good relations between the siblings and their mother is shown as realistic as the problematic relation between them and their incorrigible father. The viewer gets the impression of a different culture but he will recognize a lot of aspects of his own family life, too, what was aimed by the makers who brought in the personal experiences. All in all, this movie is an evening-filling enrichment for the viewer."
Kurenai no buta,1992,7.7,"In 1930s Italy, a veteran World War I pilot is cursed to look like an anthropomorphic pig.","The thing I like most about Studio Ghibli's films are that they are always beautifully animated and nimbly voiced. Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away are my favourites, but I will say that I love all the Studio Ghiblis for differentiating reasons. Porco Rosso is a very charming animated film, that is very imaginative as well. The animation is just stunning, with vibrant colours and picturesque Italian landscapes. Also the visuals with Porco's plane is just mind blowing. The visuals are perfectly matched by a truly beautiful music score, that helped make it a very relaxing watch. The story is a very intriguing one, and original, the characters are engaging and the story is of good quality. The English vocal characterisations were excellent, Michael Keaten being the biggest surprise, voicing a hugely engaging character, and while not exactly handsome, Porco has a heart of gold and genuinely cares for Fio, beautifully dynamic voice work from Kimberley Willaims-Paisley. Cary Elwes is also impressive as Curtis, Susan Egan is lovely as Madame Gina and David Ogden Stiers as Piccolo brings some well timed comic relief to the role. Overall, a stunning animated film, yes the ending is a little ambiguous, but Porco Rosso is well worth watching. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
The Hundred-Foot Journey,2014,7.3,The Kadam family leaves India for France where they open a restaurant directly across the road from Madame Mallory's Michelin-starred eatery.,"The movie is titled ""A Hundred Foot Journey"", and it's not just the protagonists in the movie who will embark on a journey, but so will you, the moviegoer. You will laugh, you will smile, you will wonder, and you will be immersed in the surroundings of a picturesque small town in the mountains of France where two beautiful (and delicious!) cultures clash, mingle, and eventually harmonize. In short, you will view a Hollywood ‚Äì Bollywood fusion that is done so well that you will ask for more.The movie weaves in light-hearted humor throughout, yet honestly depicts the awkwardness and tension between the newly arrived Indian family and the local French townspeople. The struggles faced by the Indian diaspora, so prevalent in Bollywood today, is explored with sincerity and comedy. Helen Mirren was great, but for me the star was Om Puri, who pulled off the role of an immigrant father to perfection. Having grown up with an Indian father abroad, I know that the struggle of adjusting to a new country while holding dearly to your values and culture is not an easy one, and often results in a complicated mix of motives, values and ideals in those individuals. Yet Om Puri strikes a perfect note. His lines are probably the most memorable in the movie.To summarize, the movie is a must watch!"
The Intruder,1999,4.8,"Catherine meets, marries and moves in with widower Nick. Strange things start happening to her in his apartment. Is she just imagining it or. . .","This film is yet another example of the less than adequate sound quality in many imports. This film has dialogue that counts, it deserves theatrical level sound - not the shoddy system that is all too common in Two Left Feet Corp. imports. There is a nice streak of relativistic sci-fi, and as in Event Horizon et al - it's amazing how all arguments about relativistic time can be solved by folding a piece of paper! If Only! The acting is reasonable - except for the worst impression of a lawyer I have ever seen! I think that this guy had the script in his lap! Oh Well - if nothing else on the shelf grabs you - this is worth the rent - but rental ONLY!"
Blue Jasmine,2013,7.3,"A New York socialite, deeply troubled and in denial, arrives in San Francisco to impose upon her sister. She looks like a million dollars but isn't bringing money, peace or love.","""Blue Jasmine"" is a Drama movie in which we follow Jasmine, a once-wealthy New York socialite who struggles to cope with a dramatic fall from grace after her husband's financial scandal.I found this movie interesting and emotionally intense, since it explore themes like loss, delusion, and personal unraveling. The interpretation of Cate Blanchett who played as Jasmine was extraordinary and the undeniable highlight of the movie. She delivered a captivating portrayal of a woman slowly descending into madness, while the contrast between her past extravagant life and her current crumbling reality created a compelling narrative. I believe that Cate Blanchett made one of her best performance if not her best, something that engaged the audience. The direction which was made by Woody Allen was very good and he brought out strong interpretations from the entire cast. All in all, I have to say that ""Blue Jasmine"" is an amazing movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it."
I.Q.,1994,6.2,"A mechanic romances the mathematician niece of physicist Albert Einstein, with help from him and his friends.","The love story here is cute and Tim Robbins has some nice moments, but the reason to watch the movie is Walter Matthau as Albert Einstien.  (Meg Ryan has a typical Meg-Ryan-nice-girl performance.  What that means, exactly, is up to the reader to decide.)  Matthau makes the physicist humble, scheming, fun, and generally endearing.  Plus, he and his peers have most of the great lines (e.g. ""Don't let your brain interfere with your heart"".)"
When a Man Loves a Woman,1994,6.6,The seemingly perfect relationship between a man and his wife is tested as a result of her alcoholism.,"Michael Green (Andy Garcia) and his wife, Alice (Meg Ryan) are living the good life in San Francisco. They are both professionals, they live in a lovely home, and they have two beautiful daughters (Tina Majorino and Mae Whitman). But, they also have a secret. Alice is a ""closet"" alcoholic, who is on the verge of showing it to the world and Michael is doing his best to cover for her to everyone. Things are complicated, for Alice seems happier when she is in the ""party mood"" and Michael loves her so much that he actually appears to relish his role as the one Alice calls on to put herself back together. Yet, even a vacation to Mexico does not help Alice find the self-happiness she needs to lose the bottle. Also, Alice injures herself at home, scaring the girls beyond measure and they are suffering from neglect, too. Therefore, Alice has to enter a ""Betty Ford"" type clinic. But, will Michael and Alice both like and love each other when Alice is sober? This is a great movie for its honest portrayal of the effects an alcoholic has on the family he or she loves and on the long climb out of the world of alcoholism. Alice and Michael are not really living the American dream but the American nightmare, because of Alice's need for one drink after another. Both Ryan and Garcia are truly wonderful in roles that call upon them to be both lovable and repugnant, at the same time. The other cast members, including Ellen Burstyn and the two lovely little girl-actresses, are also just perfect. Naturally, the settings in San Fran and Mexico are great, especially the Green's beautiful old house. Costumes, too, are very well-chosen and all other other productions values of direction, photography and story are most worthy, too. Then, too, the film also has great value as a movie to show the realities of alcoholism to any audience that could benefit from such a view. In summary, if you are a man or woman who loves movies that tell a tale well, with gorgeous stars, even if it might result in a few shed tears, this is a great choice. You might even pop it in when you need a ""good cry"", for it has wonderful cathartic elements."
Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo,1999,5.7,"An average aquarium cleaner house-sits for a gigolo, only to be forced to become one himself.",Deuce Bigalow is exactly what you would expect from this production team and straight up you either like them or you don't.I like them so for me Deuce Bigalow hits the spots I expected it to hit.The comedy is low brow but its not trying to be an art film so its all good.And I'm not going to apoligise for my absolute love of the term/category of 'He B!tch' :) My wife and I have been using that expression for years now and it never gets old!!The cast throughout is fun and add plenty of comedy gold.Its a fun movie that most will at least get some moments of mirth from and others will laugh their socks off :)
Much Ado About Nothing,1993,7.3,"Young lovers, and soon to wed, Hero and Claudio conspire to get verbal sparring partners and confirmed singles, Benedick and Beatrice, to wed as well.","The arrival of Don Pedro and his men at the home of Seigneur Leonato in Messina brings about much celebration.  The spirit of love and happiness is alive in the party and Count Claudio and Leonato's daughter Hero make woo and engage to marry within a week.  To pass the time Don Pedro makes a pledge to engage confirmed bachelor Benedick and the bickering Beatrice together in a tower of affection.  However Claudio's brother, Don John, conspires to break up the wedding by making accusations against young Hero. Will it all be much ado about nothing?If anyone has done more to bring Shakespeare to a modern audience of multiplex dwellers, I'd like to meet them.  Here Branagh yet again adapts a Shakespeare play to good effect, trimming the dialogue of some important sections with the aim of creating a lighter feel worthy of the title.  I make no mention of the plot suffice to say that Branagh has done well to keep the essence and feel of the work very true but without forcing the tools that Shakespeare readily used but may not work on modern audiences easily (i.e. not being able to recognise someone easily when they wear a mask, veil or moustache!).The dialogue is very sparky as you'd expect and Branagh has done well to interpret the humour from the words on the page.  I think of the dialogue around the police officer.  Reading it from the page I never realised how much humour could be drawn form this characters scenes in terms of how the other characters view in.  Of course the praise of lies with Shakespeare but Branagh knows the Bard well.The cast is international and all-star (probably to a greater extent than it needed or deserved).  Branagh is pure wonder in the lead and really brings out the whimsy in many of his scenes.  Thompson too is wonderful and the two play off each other well.  The film lost a little when the two begin to woo, but it is still enjoyable.  Briers is excellent and Blessed is a bit hammy and underused (forcing big background laughs).  Reeves is OK in a small role ¬ñ the lack of significant dialogue helped him.  Washingon fits in very well, Leonard is good but straight.  Of the Hollywood stars I think Keaton  does the best.  When he is onscreen he is a little OTT but he is simply hilarious as the fool of the piece, and Ben Elton is an interesting sidekick. Beckinsdale is good but again is not given much meat to work with outside of her perfect love for Claudio.Overall this is a very enjoyable version of the play.  Those who find Shakespeare difficult could do well to start here with something light and bubbly.  Those who enjoy Shakespeare will enjoy it as another version.  Only those who feel that the Bard should not be put onscreen for the masses (and there are some who think this way ¬ñ I have met them, they laughably call themselves purists ¬ñ elitists I think) will find fault here, because this clearly has mass appeal."
Het regent gehaktballen 2,2013,6.3,"Flint Lockwood now works at The Live Corp Company for his idol Chester V. But he's forced to leave his post when he learns that his most infamous machine is still operational, and is churning out menacing food-animal hybrids.","I love animations and visual effects so I love these films. The story isn't excellent but I don't care so much is these kind of films. Pixar is absolutely better in this, of course, but I love all these films, so I liked a lot also this one. The most thing I like in Pixar's films is that they aren't for children. In fact there're a lot of quotes that a child can't understand. Furthermore, the animations are really great, fantastic, gorgeous, something that a child can't realise and like totally. Although, there're a lot of funny moments but it's not enough for a better vote, so it's a 7, thanks to the animations. They are really well done, and also the ideas of the food-animals, or foodimals like the film said, but the story is just a 6. The first one was better, but I suggest to you to watch both of them, if you like animation films."
Dumb and Dumber To,2014,5.6,"20 years since their first adventure, Lloyd and Harry go on a road trip to find Harry's newly discovered daughter, who was given up for adoption.","(Originally posted as a comment to a site's review)(I'm glad that many people were able to find enjoyment in this, this comment isn't intended to cause any judging or disrespect on your experience watching this. Sincerely glad it brought you laughter and joy)Not to take the first film too serious, but it did have heart. Lloyd's speech at the beginning of the first one, it felt sincere. There was a great sense of desperation in his lonely hopes of having more friends.As the first film goes on, it's amusing and funny seeing exactly why he and Harry can't have friends (""You don't kill people you don't know, that's the rule."" *minutes after meeting Harry and Lloyd, pulls for his gun*), and even getting insight into Lloyd's warped mind of what it could be like to live a more active social life (joking with friends by the fireplace, pleasant dinner with lovely girlfriend, chomping on someone's nuts and ripping out a chef's heart....)the first film literally starts on Hope Street.Best of all, I love that at the end of everything, Harry and Lloyd still at least have each other.No, it wasn't a big quality film, it was largely a string of dumb jokes. But if you pay enough attention, you'll find there's fantastic warmth and even a story going on (outside of what seems to be the main point of returning a briefcase), both of which is severely missing in the latest film.I did laugh a bit throughout. But, Carrey and Daniels were more of glorified cartoon parodies rather the two characters we saw 20 years ago. The entire world itself felt like a glorified cartoon parody with loose sight of the first film.Anyone needing a laugh, the film may deliver, but your old pals Harry and Lloyd, and the world you were acquainted with 20 years ago, won't be there."
Madagascar 2,2008,6.6,"The Madagascar animals fly back to New York City, but crash-land on an African nature reserve in Kenya, where they meet others of their own kind, and Alex especially discovers his royal heritage as prince of a lion pride.","Just saw this at a discount movie theater ($2.50 a seat) and that's about what it's worth. Don't watch it expecting some major innovative work of art - it isn't, nor was it meant to be. It's purely fun fluff.Without a doubt, the penguins steal the show. Their banter and antics are just downright hysterical. Granny on the other hand, needs to be retired. A cameo of her might have been funny, but she is overused to the point of irritation.The ill-fated aircraft ride is a raucous ride, but after that the story splits into four or five (at least) concurrent sub-plots, so enough time isn't really given to each, and the pacing tends to jerk along in spurts. Basically it seems as if the filmmakers just strung together scenes of the funniest supporting characters from the original then tried to wrap it around a Lion King send-up.All that said, I actually liked this one better than the original. Not every movie is intended to be a piece of ground-breaking cinematic artistry and this certainly isn't. But it IS just downright fun to watch. Now if Dreamworks would just give the penguins their OWN full-length picture..."
Project T,2015,6.4,"Bound by a shared destiny, a teen bursting with scientific curiosity and a former boy-genius inventor embark on a mission to unearth the secrets of a place somewhere in time and space that exists in their collective memory.","I'll keep this relatively short. I'm a 60 year old, very hard to please Brit. This film, pleased me very much indeed. Hence, the 9 out of 10 score. Those who marked this film down, really do require a reality check. I'm not usually given to writing film reviews, but on seeing this film's current low rating - I felt compelled to write something positive, in its favour. The acting and special effects alone, stand on their own. The film, may well be 105 minutes long, but it's 105 of the best spent minutes I've had, this millennium. I won't delve into the film's storyline, as that has been adequately explained by others. If you want to be engagingly captivated, in a futuristic, make-believe World - where anything seems possible - then this is the film for you. I for one, would love to escape the current mess of a World we live in - to experience the alternative dimension, on offer, in Tomorrowland: A World Beyond"
Bridge of Spies,2015,7.6,"During the Cold War, an American lawyer is recruited to defend an arrested Soviet spy in court, and then help the CIA facilitate an exchange of the spy for the Soviet captured American U2 spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers.","Reviewers say 'Bridge of Spies' is lauded for Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance's performances and Steven Spielberg's direction. The film is appreciated for its historical accuracy and period detail. However, some find the plot slow and dialogue-heavy, impacting its overall effectiveness. The cinematography and production design receive frequent praise. Despite mixed views on pacing and plot, it is generally seen as an engaging historical drama offering a distinct Cold War perspective."
Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian,2009,6.0,"Security guard Larry Daley infiltrates the Smithsonian Institution in order to rescue Jedediah and Octavius, who have been shipped to the museum by mistake.","When I saw the trailer for this, I was pretty excited. I loved the whole premise of the first one, and having a sequel opened up whole new opportunities. I was excited when I saw all these famous characters from history being mashed together, Al Capone, Napoleon Bonaparte, Amelia Earhart, to name a few.I walked into the theater not expecting to much, but when I left I was very happy with it. They handled every characters personality beautifully, and the inside jokes were hilarious. I don't want to give much away, but trust me, you'll laugh. It tackles many themes like, a house divided cannot stand, the way to happiness is doing what you love, don't dwell on the past, etc. For a family flick they handle this jumbled cast of characters with complex personalities amazingly. They threw away most of the characters from the first movie to make way for the newer characters, which I didn't like that much, but how many characters can you throw in a story to have it make sense?This film is an amazing example of a movie made for kids and adults. Kids will enjoy the silly humor, and the monkey. While adults will laugh at the onslaught of in-jokes, and trust me, there's a lot.All in all, this was a great movie, blew me away. The highlight for me was Hank Azaria, that lisp kills me every time."
Binnenstebuiten,2015,8.1,"After young Riley is uprooted from her Midwest life and moved to San Francisco, her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness - conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house, and school.","Reviewers say 'Inside Out' is praised for its creativity, emotional depth, and voice acting. Many appreciate its complex themes and humor, deeming it suitable for all ages. However, some find it boring, overly intricate for children, and lacking in character development. Despite these drawbacks, many still value it for its innovative concept and emotional resonance, making it a worthwhile watch."
The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian,2008,6.5,"The Pevensie siblings return to Narnia, where they are enlisted to once again help ward off an evil king and restore the rightful heir to the land's throne, Prince Caspian.","As a little girl, I adored the Chronicles of Narnia books, and I still do. I also liked the BBC adaptations, done in mini-series format, they weren't amazing, but they were enjoyable and stuck to the books' spirit. As far as these film versions go, I haven't yet seen Voyage of the Dawn Treader, but I enjoyed Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. Prince Caspian was not a bad film, but it could have been better.Visually, the film is very well done. I loved the cinematography, while the scenery and costumes are gorgeous. The effects are also good, and Aslan still looks brilliant. The music is beautiful too, with lovely melodies. The end credits song was nice, but I think it should have stayed as an end credits song, it didn't seem right placing it in the final scene to me. The direction is decent too, while the battle sequences are riveting, and the film did begin well.As far as the acting goes, it wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing either. The best are Eddie Izzard who is spot on, Peter Dinklage who comes close to stealing the film with his eyes alone and Liam Neeson who lends his majestic voice to Aslan, and while her appearance is very brief Tilda Swinton is quite chilling. The four leads are good enough, and in Georgie Henley's case improved. Edmund also has potential. I had mixed feelings on Miraz though, more to how he was written than how he was acted. Sergio Castellitto does make an effort to make Miraz dark and charismatic for the villain of the piece, but the way Miraz is written and developed makes him come across as insipid. The weak link is Ben Barnes. He is handsome and has his moments, but he is rather bland on the whole.My real problems with Prince Caspian are in the storytelling and pace mainly. The story has a tendency to become too unengaging, the more involving scenes are well done but the slower scenes are close to ponderous. The pace is rather lethargic this time round, while I don't think the film really needed to be as long as it was and the characters come across as shallow. Also particularly with Caspian and Miraz, some of the dialogue is stilted.All in all, Prince Caspian is not a bad film, but it lacked something. I also forgot to say as an adaptation of the book it is not great, granted the book was not my favourite of the series but I felt sometimes there was a bit too much padding that could have been excised slightly. A disappointment, but on its own terms and for the visuals and music it is worth a look. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
John Wick,2014,7.5,"John Wick is a former hitman grieving the loss of his true love. When his home is broken into, robbed, and his dog killed, he is forced to return to action to exact revenge.","Reviewers say 'John Wick' is acclaimed for its intense action, stylish direction, and Keanu Reeves' strong performance. The film is lauded for its well-choreographed fights, innovative camera work, and dark atmosphere. Themes of revenge, loss, and criminal dynamics are prominent. While many enjoy the action and style, some criticize the thin plot and shallow characters. The supporting cast, including Willem Dafoe and Ian McShane, enhances the film's world. Overall, 'John Wick' is seen as an entertaining, engaging action film."
Harry Potter en de halfbloed prins,2009,7.6,"As Harry Potter begins his sixth year at Hogwarts, he discovers an old book marked as ""the property of the Half-Blood Prince"" and begins to learn more about Lord Voldemort's dark past.","I was lucky enough to see a preview of Half-Blood Prince three days before opening day. I saw it a second time with my son who is not quite ten, but who is generally mature for his age and doesn't scare easily. The two viewings give me the unique advantage of both the adult and the child perspective on the movie.I only recently started counting myself a true Harry Potter fan after my son introduced me to the movies a couple of years ago. I finished the last book only three weeks before seeing the movie adaptation of Half-Blood Prince the first time.With all the book details very fresh in my mind, I had high expectations of the movie. And Yates, the production crew and the cast definitely delivered. The movie impresses on many levels from an artistic point of view. The stripped landscapes and washed out colors convey a constant feeling of dread and foreboding. The standard train trip to Hogwarts was particularly stark, seen against a landscape scorched by a hot summer sun and dotted with dark pools of water. The usual lush greenery and joyous train ride are nowhere to be seen.Personally, I felt the pace was spot-on and that the movie elegantly made time for all key plot points. But only if you enjoy a plot line driven by character and emotion. For the younger lot, looking for frightening wizard duels and attacks by magical creatures, the first hour and a half of the movie drags on a bit. My son certainly became fidgety, and didn't appreciate the finesse and sophistication of the plot and cinematic approach.Most of the threatening and darkening tone of the movie was also lost upon him, whereas I reveled in the finer details contributing to a general sense of ever-encroaching darkness. There are worse things in life to be afraid of than big hairy spiders. My son missed seeing those - I was a lot more intrigued by the ominous undercurrents made palpable by the indomitable trio of David Yates (director), Steve Kloves (screenplay) and Delbonnel (photography).Some people feel that the romantic comedy aspects played too large a role in the movie, but I felt this aspect added some much-needed lightness and human drama to the movie. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) all find themselves dealing with the vagaries of young love - from dealing with unwanted advances to finding love in unexpected places. The romance was aimed perfectly at the young teen market, and I found myself cringing ruefully at some of Lavender Brown's love-obsessed stunts and smiling wistfully at the tenderness between Harry and Ginny. Haven't we all been there at some stage of our lives?All in all, Harry Potter is growing up. And so is the market for these movies. If you've seen all the movies up to now or read all the books, and your are at an age to appreciate the adult themes and movie techniques, this movie should fall pitch-perfect on your ear. You are likely to leave the cinema filled with a heart-wrenching sadness for innocence lost.Purist fans will most certainly complain bitterly about numerous sub-plots, events and characters that were cut from the movie and the odd scene that doesn't exist in the book. But Yates' truly gutsy adaptation really works and brings a depth and clarity to the main themes of the book that is quite extraordinary. He manages to capture the lingering lightness of that time before the serious business of adulthood sets in, alongside the relentless buildup to the final showdown between The Dark Lord and The Chosen One. And the lack of closure at the end of the movie is no accident, I believe. Just like the book, this movie leaves you aching to see how it all ends (never mind the fact that you already know).I must also commend the acting. The young leads have all matured in pace with the maturing content of the books and their acting shows it. Rupert Grint shines brightly in the somewhat Shakespearean love comedy he finds himself in, and makes the most of his new-found sport hero popularity. Emma Watson hits the spot, portraying Hermione's emotional vulnerability with gentle confidence and softness.As for Radcliffe, it's easy to miss the evolution he's undergone as Harry, since there are other actors ostensibly given more to do in this outing, like Tom Felton and Bonnie Wright, both of whom get the opportunity to take their characters to a new level. Tom Felton, especially, does a remarkable job. But Radcliffe's task of playing the steadfast and courageous, yet not flashy or arrogant hero, remains a difficult one. Especially on second viewing, it becomes clear how his understated and controlled performance speaks very much to the type of man Harry Potter is shaping up to be. A man who is left with a tremendous responsibility at the end of this movie and takes it up without flinching. The boy-wizard is no more.Of the older guard, Alan Rickman's Snape was a consummate performance, ... obviously. And Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore never felt more right than in this movie. Jim Broadbent's Slughorn is deliciously played with just the right mix of off-putting sycophancy and endearing pathos.All in all - a triumph all around!"
47 Ronin,2013,6.2,A band of samurai sets out to avenge the death and dishonor of their master at the hands of a ruthless shogun.,"Everyone has movies like this. You know they are bad and you know they are ridiculous but for whatever reason, you just thoroughly enjoy them. This is one of those movies for me. Maybe it will be for you too."
Wo hu cang long,2000,7.9,A young Chinese warrior steals a sword from a famed swordsman and then escapes into a world of romantic adventure with a mysterious man in the frontier of the nation.,"What people who aren't Chinese and who don't know much about Chinese culture fail to understand, is that the warrior mythology portrayed in films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero has its roots in a particular genre of fiction that has been around much longer than television or film.Having grown up reading a bunch of these stories of epic fantasy, I remember being surprised when I went to watch CTHD in the theaters, and saw the audience break out in laughter at the flying stunts. I suppose the concept probably does seem ridiculous to foreigners.The whole deal with the flying is this:In the stories, the world of ""Giang Hu"" mentioned in CTHD is the unconventional part of society in which the characters that practice high transcendent martial arts exist. ""Giang Hu"" literally translates to something like ""lakes and rivers"", which kind of is a cultural allusion to the fact that most of these people wander a whole lot participating in great duels of swordsmanship and all kinds of tragic drama.One of the forms of transcendent martial arts is ""chin guon"", which translates to something like ""the art of lightness"". It's a skill that these warrior folk develop from a young age using various methods that make it so they can move as if they were light as a feather. I think the idea is that they're trained so that they progressively have less and less of a perception of their own weight, and thus they can run up walls and fly across rooftops in style.There's another type of martial art which involves transmitting ""chi"" (spiritual essence or whatever you want to call it) through your hands or fingertips and into the pressure points of others, either doing them harm, rendering them unable to move, or restoring some of their strength.If you don't understand that it's another culture's fiction/mythology and can't get over that it defies known physics and medicine etc., well, too bad.At the same time, look at acupuncture. Millions swear by the benefits of acupuncture. Hell, my father had a stroke that paralyzed half his face and went to four separate doctors. They couldn't do a damn thing. He then went to an acupuncturist and after two sessions the paralysis was gone. Conventional medicine still has no idea how acupuncture could possibly work, yet a lot of doctors will accept it as a viable option. Who the hell knows, maybe once upon a time in China people could fly.I find Chinese warrior mythology pretty interesting, and the problem is that these novels do not translate well. I'm not sure if anyone has ever tried. A lot of what goes on in them has a lot of cultural relevance and wouldn't be readily understood by certain people who have Western sensibilities. Hong Kong and Taiwan have for a couple of decades produced a lot of television shows that portray these stories, but they're mostly pretty cheesy like American soap operas.Which is why CTHD is semi-important as a film. It's the first film to expose a lot Americans to this facet of Chinese mythology, and I hope it's not the last."
What Dreams May Come,1998,7.0,"Chris Nielsen dies in an accident, and enters Heaven. But when he discovers that his beloved wife Annie has killed herself out of grief over the loss, he embarks on an afterlife adventure to reunite with her.","I love this movie because it is truly romantic- it shows that love does not just happen in an instant, or at first glance, but is something that you have to commit to and work at.  It's not just 'boys meets girl, stuff happens, they get married and live happily ever after' - Annie and Chris have to deal with real adversity and issues, which are shown through numerous flashbacks throughout the film. (ie- Chris being embarrassed to dance, teaching his daughter about death)You're not supposed to watch this film for the visual effects.  They're great, but they're not the point.  If you have a short attention span, and are expecting action thrown at you every five seconds, then go watch something else, and don't complain that this film is boring.This film was very simple and very human. If you want inspiration that REAL love exists (and not that stupid teen movie crap), then I highly recommend it."
The Thomas Crown Affair,1999,6.9,"A very rich and successful playboy amuses himself by stealing artwork, but may have met his match in a seductive detective.","This DVD was an impulse buy, pure and simple.  My wife and I like Pierce Brosnan, and I have enjoyed Renee Russo's other works, so what did I have to lose?  Only my mind!  This film was positively one of the most enjoyable, nail-biting, suspenseful romantic capers ever made.A remake of the steamy 1968 Steve McQueen flick updated to the sleek and self-referential 90s, ""Thomas Crown"" features Brosnan as the title character - a bored billionaire businessman in the business of ""acquisitions"".  For a thrill, he heists an extremely valuable Monet from the New York Museum right under the noses of security guards, cops, and about a thousand unsuspecting museum-goers.  Renee Russo is the very sexy, very worldly Catherine Banning, whose insurance company underwrites the painting - and she is determined to get it back at any cost... But the cost just may be her soul as she woos, and then falls under the spell of the enigmatic Crown.  Will Russo discover the location of the Monet?  Will she rat out Thomas Crown? Or is Crown manipulating her affections like Bobby Fisher manipulates the pieces on a chess board?What we have here is a high-speed chase film whose vehicle is clever dialog, rich and exotic direction, and more than a little sexual tension!  Brosnan, as Crown, is ever the cool Brit charmer whose every word and action are as calculated as the movements of a Rolex.  Russo smoulders every time she appears on screen.  And when the two of them get together, the chemical reaction is pure dynamite.Dennis Leary has a nice bit as a streetwise NYPD detective on the case, who dispenses advice to Russo's Banning, and watches her begin to spiral out of control.  His role here most likely resulted in the deserved attempt at a television series on ABC (""The Job"").The action in the film moves exotically from caper to cover-up and back with dizzying speed... All the while, we are kept guessing about the motivations of the two lead, and find ourselves eagerly anticipating their next move. When the final checkmate comes, we are left totally bewildered, befuddled, and baffled... which is most-likely the director's intention!On all levels, ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" will steal the hearts of men and women alike... but for different reasons - Men can enjoy the action and thrill of the chase, and Crown's ability to win over the most beautiful women and his attempt to get away with the ultimate heist... Ladies can marvel at the suave Brosnan and his life of extreme wealth, and all-the-while wonder if he will betray her, or if she will betray him...I will not betray you... I ain't saying!"
Jurassic World,2015,6.9,"A new theme park, built on the original site of Jurassic Park, creates a genetically modified hybrid dinosaur, the Indominus Rex, which escapes containment and goes on a killing spree.","Reviewers say 'Jurassic World' is lauded for its thrilling action, impressive CGI, and nostalgic references to 'Jurassic Park'. Chris Pratt's performance as Owen Grady is a standout, especially his character's bond with the raptors. However, criticisms include reliance on clich√©s, underdeveloped characters, and a predictable plot. Unrealistic scenarios, like characters fleeing in high heels, are noted. Despite these issues, many find the film entertaining and spectacular."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,2014,7.7,"As Steve Rogers struggles to embrace his role in the modern world, he teams up with a fellow Avenger and S.H.I.E.L.D agent, Black Widow, to battle a new threat from history: an assassin known as the Winter Soldier.","Reviewers say 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is acclaimed for its thrilling action, intricate characters, and political intrigue. The film excels in espionage and moral dilemmas, with standout performances from Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, and Sebastian Stan. The introduction of Falcon and character exploration enhances the narrative. Critics appreciate the balance of action and storytelling, though some note pacing issues and over-reliance on action. Overall, it's considered a significant improvement and a standout MCU entry."
Paddington,2014,7.3,"A young Peruvian bear travels to London in search of a home. Finding himself lost and alone at Paddington Station, he meets the kindly Brown family, who offer him a temporary haven.","I saw ""Paddington"" with my granddaughter (almost four) and it's hard to be sure who enjoyed it most since this is such an utterly charming and entertaining movie.Visually it is a delightful CGI representation of the eponymous bear (politely voiced by Ben Wishaw) and deploys some neat cinematic devices; script-wise it combines humour, word play, and sharp allusions to the plight of the immigrant; while acting- wise we have a slew of marvellous British performers including Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins and Julie Walters as the adults in Paddington's new family and Nicole Kidman who has other plans for our furry friend.In a movie full of delights, the bathroom scene is a classic. A sequel or even a series is inevitable and would be most welcome."
The Equalizer,2014,7.3,A man who believes he has put his mysterious past behind him cannot stand idly by when he meets a young girl under the control of ultra-violent Russian gangsters.,"Denzel Washington is just great and The Equalizer belongs like the John Wick (Keanu Reeves) and Taken (Liam Neeson) movies to the new masterclass of revenge/vigilante movies. The Equalizer is a true to the heart successor of our former (or still) heroes of long gone times like Mr. Eastwood and Mr. Bronson: the king is dead, long live the king, so to say.The Equalizer is great stuff - if you like your action spiced up with a good shot of violence."
Mot naturen,2014,6.9,"A journey inside Martin's head. He's on a weekend mountain trip, and we get to know his thoughts. Unsensored, essential, existential and silly about feelings and fantasies. A recognizable film about being human, and how we tick and think.","a large slice of every day reality. simple. honest. maybe, courageous. because it is a film like a mirror. reflecting middle age crisis. defining the life as a large circle of doubts. exploring rules and social expectations and the idea of new beginning in life, the lost of youth, the responsibilities as head of family, the pressure of need to be free, to have time for yourself, to escape from different forms of hypocrisy, to be happy, real happy, to have the innocence and the clear purposes of the first ages. Martin is portrait of many viewers. profound different viewers. and this did ""Mot naturen"" a masterpiece. because, different by many films, it did not gives a story. but reminds yours story. with precision and realism and out of any mask. proposing an answer. in many cases - the only who works."
And So It Goes,2014,5.9,A self-absorbed realtor enlists the help of his neighbor when he's suddenly left in charge of the granddaughter he never knew existed until his estranged son drops her off at his home.,"If you were told to watch a movie directed by Rob Reiner, starring Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton, with a budget of $30 mil. you could think that you are about to experience a movie with powerful emotions and an interesting plot.Actually, in the end, this is a rather simple movie and its course is obvious from the beginning.Michael Douglas plays Oren Little, a realtor who's about to retire after he makes his last sale, and Diane Keaton plays his singer next-door neighbor. What will happen between them is to be seen (I won't spoil it for you) but I'm pretty sure you have already guessed.The acting from the 2 veteran actors is effortless but the direction from the once-mighty Rob Reiner is too simple and targeting more for a few easy laughs if nothing else. Note that Reiner is also in the movie as the pianist who plays for Diane Keaton's character.It's a dramedy more than just a comedy but even the dramatic elements are more likely to promote laughter, if not anything else.There a couple of good songs sang by Keaton (?) and you also get to see Grease's Frankie Valli in a cameo appearance.Overall: It's OK. Douglas/Keaton are fun to watch, but don't expect greatness."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,2015,7.3,"When Tony Stark and Bruce Banner try to jump-start a dormant peacekeeping program called Ultron, things go horribly wrong and it's up to Earth's mightiest heroes to stop the villainous Ultron from enacting his terrible plan.","Reviewers say 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is lauded for its thrilling action, humor, and Hawkeye's development. However, it faces criticism for a complex plot, underdeveloped characters like Ultron and the twins, inconsistent tone, and heavy CGI use. Some felt it fell short of its predecessor in cohesion and charm. Despite these drawbacks, many still appreciated its role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and found it entertaining."
When Harry Met Sally...,1989,7.7,"Harry and Sally have known each other for years, and are very good friends, but they fear sex would ruin the friendship.","This movie grows like a good wine. I really didn't get it when it was first released; I avoided it like the plague. But people have a curious tendency to mature and change their POVs with time, and so was it with me. This movie opened me up to a lot of things - believe it or not, I didn't get the 'Call Me' sequence at first: I was lost, and admit it. But I am not lost now, and this movie is partly responsible.Meg might be the reason guys want to see this movie, again and again, but after a while you begin to appreciate the contribution Crystal made to the film. The dialogue has his name all over it. The dialogue in this film is at times simply amazing - check the memorable quotes here if you've seen the movie and have forgot.I would not pick this movie out of a barrel as most likely to be so influential, but it's a fact that it is, and rightfully so. Great support from Kirby and Fisher. Today it's Hanks and Ryan who are paired, thanks undoubtedly to Sleepless in Seattle, but one wonders why no one has tried to get Crystal and Ryan back together again. They're fantastic.This is one of the all-time best movies ever made. All-time 10? Or 20? or 1000? I don't know; it's just one of the best - it has that quality about it. Keeper."
Focus,2015,6.6,"In the midst of veteran con man Nicky's latest scheme, a woman from his past - now an accomplished femme fatale - shows up and throws his plans for a loop.","Focus is a con movie and it's at its best when it's trying to con you into believing you know what is going to happen. The plot unfolds at a steady pace and you are left guessing what is going to follow. There are many twists and it's hard to keep up, as you would expect.The regular cons work best in the first half, when the movie is trying to be fun and entertaining. During the second half of the movie the plot deepens and works around character development. That's when Will Smith and Margot Robbie come to life, they are at their best when they are given more to work with and they keep the movie interesting. However the movie gets caught juggling too many cons which by the end of the movie may feel just a bit flat; but still make for an unexpected and enjoyable finale.Definitely worth watching. PS. The directors did a good job showing the importance of FOCUS in keeping the camera Focused at the right place."
The Martian,2015,8.0,"An astronaut becomes stranded on Mars after his team assumes him dead, and must rely on his ingenuity to find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive and can survive until a potential rescue.","Reviewers say 'The Martian' is lauded for its engaging plot, Matt Damon's compelling performance, and its mix of humor and drama. The film is appreciated for its realistic space survival depiction and scientific accuracy. However, some find it overly optimistic and emotionally shallow, with underdeveloped characters. Pacing issues and reliance on convenient plot devices are noted criticisms. Despite these, 'The Martian' is widely seen as an entertaining and thought-provoking sci-fi film."
Big Eyes,2014,7.0,"A drama about the awakening of painter Margaret Keane, her phenomenal success in the 1950s, and the subsequent legal difficulties she had with her husband, who claimed credit for her works in the 1960s.","Charming, but uneven, entertaining yet unsatisfying, ""Big Eyes"" definitely does not come into the category of great or important true story movies. It is clearly a change of style for Tim Burton (if is very relieving not to see Johhny Depp acting all weird), but even though the time at the theater doesn't in any way feel wasted or boring, instead quite pleasant, the movie is too chaotic and quirky for it to be taken seriously in any way.A premise that has lots of potential is partially wasted in aimless scenes or in repetitiveness. The film doesn't really make a point about anything and has way too much flashy stuff to feel grounded in any way. There would be nothing wrong there, but the fact that in it's uneven tone there seems to emerge a will to give an accurate and worthy recounting of these events makes so much of the drama feel out of nowhere. Storytelling isn't exactly where the movie succeeds. The courtroom scenes are definitely the weakest of all and made me mad multiple times because of their absolute preposterousness.Anyways, the film is built around a strong enough cast, photography, premise, writing and design that it would be hard to get bored in anyway. The pace is fluent enough and the duration of the film is just about right for the content it presents. I wanted to like this more and see the story be given a better portrayal, but in no way I could say ""Big Eyes"" was a failure."
New Girl,,7.8,"After a bad break-up, Jess, an offbeat young woman, moves into an apartment loft with three single men. Although they find her behavior very unusual, the men support her - most of the time.","Reviewers say 'New Girl' is lauded for its quirky humor, distinctive character dynamics, and the strong chemistry among the cast, especially Schmidt and Nick. Zooey Deschanel's performance as Jess garners positive attention, though her character elicits mixed reactions. Some find the humor inconsistent and the show's reliance on Jess is seen as problematic. Despite these flaws, many appreciate its exploration of friendships, relationships, and its capacity to deliver both laughter and emotional depth."
Room,2015,8.1,"A little boy is held captive in a room with his mother since his birth, so he has never known the world outside.","Reviewers say 'Room' is a powerful film with strong performances, particularly from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. The movie delves into themes of captivity, motherhood, and isolation's psychological impact. Critics commend its emotional depth, cinematography, and Lenny Abrahamson's direction. Some find it slow or repetitive. The adaptation from Emma Donoghue's book is generally praised, though some feel it sugar-coats certain aspects. The mother-son relationship and their journey to freedom are central themes."
Fast & Furious 7,2015,7.1,Deckard Shaw seeks revenge against Dominic Toretto and his family for his comatose brother.,"This film tells the story of a team of daredevil drivers who ate recruited by the secret service to rescue a kidnapped hacker who has invented a powerful surveillance software.With the series being the who's who of conventional action superstars, ""Fast And Furious 7"" finally corrected the conspicuous absence of Jason Statham. He certainly doesn't disappoint, as every star deliver awesome action scenes. This film is different from the others because it's really good. It's not ridiculous and brainless like ""The Expendables"" series; and it's not attention deficit like the Bourne series. This combines action, brains and emotions, which is a perfect blend for blockbuster success.The action scenes are simply awesome. The scene of a car flying between buildings is superb, but by no means the best. There are so many other astounding scenes that got me holding my breath, literally. For example, Paul Walker trying to escape from a bus is a scene that made me stop breathing because it's so intense. The film is so packed with action, but it doesn't feel fragmented or attention deficit. That is what makes it stand above other action films.""Fast And Furious 7"" constantly surprises me with jaw dropping action. Just when I thought I have seen everything, and nothing can surprise me anymore, the surprises keep on coming. I'm truly amazed by the film. I guess no one thought James Wan could make such an awe inspiring film, after establishing himself as a great horror director."
Ex Machina,2014,7.7,A young programmer is selected to participate in a ground-breaking experiment in synthetic intelligence by evaluating the human qualities of a highly advanced humanoid A.I.,"Reviewers say 'Ex Machina' is a visually striking sci-fi film with strong performances by Alicia Vikander, Oscar Isaac, and Domhnall Gleeson. It explores themes of artificial intelligence and ethics, though some find the pacing slow and plot predictable. The minimalist setting and philosophical questions are praised, but character development and plot holes are critiqued. The ending is divisive, yet the film's visual effects and cinematography are widely commended."
Carol,2015,7.3,An aspiring photographer develops an intimate relationship with an older woman in 1950s New York.,"'Carol' is a fine film. The juxtaposition of the lavish costumes and production design with the grainy look of 16mm film sells the film's old-fashioned aesthetic. It is a well-shot film that is pleasant to look at. All of the individual performances are pretty good.The best part of the film is the opening sequence. The credits play over a continuing shot of fifties New York accompanied by Carter Burwell's fantastic piece 'Opening'. This shot brings us to a scene in a restaurant. This is a flash-forward that we revisit later on in the film. Our first sight of the main couple occurs when a man at the bar looks around the restaurant and spots them at a table. In this shot, Therese (Rooney Mara) and Carol (Cate Blanchett) are sitting at a table. Therese is sat facing away from the camera and towards Carol, who we can see clearly. My immediate reaction to this sight was ""Wow, Cate Blanchett genuinely looks like she's in love."" It felt real.Unfortunately, I didn't get this feeling from the rest of the film. I couldn't feel any chemistry between Therese and Carol. Mara and Blanchett do their best with what they are given, but they aren't given enough. Their characters don't feel fleshed out. I didn't feel like I knew them as people by the end. The film's technical achievements can only lift a film so high. If you love this film then I'm glad, but I can't love it when I couldn't grow attached to the characters. This is especially a problem as this feels like a film driven more by character than by story.Despite what I have said, this film didn't bore me. Mara and Blanchett are both engaging actresses who command your attention even if they aren't given enough to work with. The film is on the slow side but it goes at the right pace for what director Todd Haynes and screenwriter Phyllis Nagy were going for. Overall, it was an interesting experience that felt a bit empty.You can see more reviews at http://letterboxd.com/lloyd_morgan/films/reviews/"
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,2015,7.4,Ethan and his team take on their most impossible mission yet when they have to eradicate an international rogue organization as highly skilled as they are and committed to destroying the IMF.,"Reviewers say 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' delivers thrilling action, impressive stunts, and a fast-paced plot. Tom Cruise's performance is lauded for intensity. The blend of espionage and action, along with global locations, is praised. However, some find the plot predictable and the antagonist underdeveloped. The supporting cast receives mixed reviews, and the humor is hit or miss. Overall, it's a solid franchise entry with flaws."
Ted 2,2015,6.3,"Newlywed couple Ted and Tami-Lynn want to have a baby, but in order to qualify to be a parent, Ted will have to prove he's a person in a court of law.","This film tells the story of a talking teddy bear who sues the government, so that he gets recognised as a human being and get human rights such as marriage and drivers license.""Ted 2"" is a hugely politically incorrect film, with a lot of swearing, sexual and crude humour. It is not usually a type of film I like, but ""Ted 2"" does have a way to get to my heart. It is sweet and emphasises a lot of love and friendship. Towards the end, the film gets very touching, and it made my eyes well up.Having a touching plot, together with a funny script makes ""Ted 2"" very entertaining, way more entertaining than I expected."
Lucy,2014,6.4,"A woman, accidentally caught in a dark deal, turns the tables on her captors and transforms into a merciless warrior evolved beyond human logic.","""Lucy,"" a high-concept sci-fi thriller from visionary French director Luc Besson, is a stimulating exploration of the human mind's potential. With its combination of slick action sequences, existential philosophizing, and dazzling visuals, it challenges and entertains in equal measure, pushing the boundaries of conventional cinema.The plot follows Lucy (Scarlett Johansson), a woman accidentally caught in a dark deal who turns the tables on her captors and transforms into a merciless warrior evolved beyond human logic. Besson has crafted a fascinating narrative that juxtaposes the gritty realism of crime syndicates with the abstract realm of cerebral possibilities.Scarlett Johansson delivers a powerhouse performance, expertly navigating her character's transformation from a terrified victim to a superhuman entity. Her nuanced portrayal ensures Lucy remains empathetic even as she becomes increasingly detached from humanity.Morgan Freeman lends gravitas as Professor Norman, a neuroscientist who serves as the narrative's anchor, grounding the escalating spectacle in a semblance of reality. His measured performance provides a necessary counterpoint to Johansson's increasingly otherworldly character.Besson's direction is fluid and kinetic, imbuing the film with a frenetic energy that propels the narrative forward even as it dips into complex concepts. His choice to intercut documentary-style nature footage adds a unique flavor, creating intriguing parallels with the story unfolding on screen.The cinematography and visual effects are dazzling, creating a vivid sensory experience that takes viewers on a roller coaster ride through time, space, and the human body. The mind-bending visual journey, coupled with Eric Serra's pulsating score, creates an intoxicating atmosphere that leaves viewers both thrilled and thoughtful.However, ""Lucy"" isn't without its flaws. Its ambitious premise often teeters on the edge of becoming too esoteric, possibly alienating viewers expecting a more straightforward action thriller. Furthermore, its fast pace and lean runtime can leave certain aspects feeling underdeveloped, notably the film's antagonists.Yet, despite these shortcomings, ""Lucy"" stands out as an audacious cinematic experience that dares to merge high-octane action with cerebral science fiction. It inspires a sense of awe and curiosity about human potential, prompting introspection about our place in the universe. It is a visual feast that stirs the mind and quickens the pulse, a cinematic cocktail of action and philosophy that leaves a lingering impression."
The Dressmaker,2015,7.0,"A glamorous woman returns to her small town in rural Australia. With her sewing machine and haute couture style, she transforms the women and exacts sweet revenge on those who did her wrong.","Based on the best-selling novel by Rosalie Ham, this comedy-drama is set in early 1950's Australia. It's a vibrant tale of revenge, mother- daughter bonds, small-town secrets and the great power of clothes, in a movie that is both bittersweet and funny and is dominated by a stunning, multi-layered performance from Kate Winslet. Jocelyn Moorhouse's latest feature is enjoyable enough and so unexpected, and let's be honest she also has a great team to help her achieve that. In few words, ""The Dressmaker"" is a dark comedy in Australian style, that will catch many by surprise, especially if you love clothes and fashion in general. nikisreviews.com"
Godzilla,2014,6.4,"The world is beset by the appearance of monstrous creatures, but one of them may be the only one who can save humanity.","During the 1950s, creatures are awaken from the deepest depths. Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) believes that ancient creatures exist that lives in radiation. As the radiation faded from the earth's surface, these creatures retreated to the lower depths. In 1999, miners uncover a vast cavern with a giant skeleton in the Philippines. They also find one of the spores broken open. In Japan at the Janjira Nuclear Power Plant, manager Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) loses his wife in a freak incident. Fifteen years later, Joe is still investigating the incident with the city around the plant quarantined. He is arrested once again for trying to breach the quarantine. His son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) has to leave behind his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) in San Francisco to go pick him up from jail in Japan. Joe convinces Ford who is now a US Navy ordnance disposal officer to join him to go to the plant. They discover that there is no radiation leak. Instead the spore from the Philippines named MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) has settled in the plant sucking up all the radiation.This is always going to be a great monster movie. The CGI is terrific and Godzilla has a great time smashing things up. That part seems like a no-brainer. I still give director Gareth Edwards credit for doing a great job. He doesn't disappoint. The problem is once again the human story. The beginning is just too long before it gets to a monster. The Joe Brody story doesn't have the bite. In another movie, his story would be a fun mystery. The problem is that the audience knows it's a monster even if it's not Godzilla. So there is no tension from the mystery since it's not really a mystery. The other problem is that Ford just happens to be at the right place in all of those situations. It's a situation that a lesser movie would rely on. I hoped for better. The final problem I have is that the movie cuts away from the monster action time and time again. It's funny the first time but it gets annoying quickly. Despite all the problems, there is still a fun monster movie and lots of stuff get smashed."
Paul Blart: Mall Cop,2009,5.3,"When a shopping mall is taken over by a gang of organized crooks, it's up to a mild-mannered security guard to save the day.","Lame-but-charming with some laugh-out-loud moments is the best way I can sum up this comedy. Overall, it's pretty innocent, especially considering most comedies today. There is very little material that could be offensive.It's a clich√© these days in films, made popular by guys like the late John Candy - fat guys picked up and proving to be heroes and getting back at the thinner-and-nasty folks who torment them. Here, it is a few co-workers at the mall and the bad guys who want to rob it.Meanwhile, our plump policeman, a security cop at a New Jersey mall, has his eyes on a pretty girl who runs a kiosk.....and you just know he'll win her - ""Amy"" (Jayma Mays) - in the end. (Hey, it's not real life, but we fat guys can dream, too!) Kevin James plays the Candy-esquire ""Paul Blart,"" a state policeman-wannabe who winds up on his scooter being the ultra-straight cop/nerd for the mall. He, of course, is unlikeliest of heroes, but turns into Rambo when needed. Along the way are a bunch of sight gags and some insults, most of which produce laughs. Some are very funny.In fact, overall the individual sight gags are funnier than the overall story but it want some nice humor and corny story that doesn't offend much, you could do a lot worse. It's got charm."
Hot Tub Time Machine 2,2015,5.0,"When Lou's shot in the groin, Nick and Jacob drag him in the Hot Tub Time Machine to go back in time and save Lou. The three end up 10 years in the future, where they need to go to find the shooter.","After watching this movie, it only confirms what I already believe, and thats critics don't know what the f*ck there talking about most of the time. I was a bit put off by all the bad reviews, but I am glad I gave it a watch because this was frickin hilarious! Sure the plot doesn't make sense or it doesn't have John Cusack, but who gives a f*ck! you get more of Craig Robinson, Rob Courddry and Clark Duke, who let's be honest provided most of the laughs from the original. Sure it's more crude and it may not appeal to all those artsy fartsy critics who are whining about the movie not being PC, but if you want a good stoner movie to watch with the guys and enjoy something without taking it too seriously, watch it! I think it is on par with the first and has been unfairly judged. Compared to most comedy sequels, that always do the same thing as the first (hangover sequels), at least this went in a completely over the top direction that was more like a bunch of comedy skits than an actual movie. Overall, I thought it was hilarious and a definite guilty pleasure. Sure it won't appeal to everyone, and its not supposed too. Obviously for a movie like this you don't expect much just a lot of laughs and this is definitely a goofy stoner comedy best enjoyed under the influence.7/10"
The King of Queens,,7.4,"Deliveryman Doug Heffernan has a good life: He has a pretty wife (Carrie), a big television, and friends with which to watch it. Then Carrie's goofy, annoying father Arthur moves in with them.","I've only seen a few episodes of this show here and there, but I can honestly say this is one of my all-time favorites. It's funny, witty, and best of all, just absurd. I particularly appreciate the character of Arthur who always has something completely out of pocket to say. It starts off a bit awkward in the first few episodes - as most new TV shows do - but eventually the actors get comfortable with each other and really commit to their characters. Most of all, I appreciate that the characters, despite stepping on each others' toes every once in a while, truly care for each other. Overall, very funny and enjoyable!"
Hot Tub Time Machine,2010,6.4,"A malfunctioning time machine at a ski resort takes a man back to 1986 with his two friends and nephew, where they must relive a fateful night and not change anything to make sure the nephew is born.","Hell, it certainly kept me damn entertained. In this day and age it takes real comedy chops to pull off poo and vomit gags with such expert timing. The film embraces the absurdity of time travel and doesn't focus too much on the whys. All four of the male leads are brilliant, especially Corddry, who pulls off one of the great movie arseholes, without completely detaching himself from the audience. There are some classic lines, mostly coming from insults, and the film doesn't rely too much on date humour (just a few references to e-mail etc.) It cleverly spits in the face of the butterfly effect and relishes its characters manipulation of time, whilst showing that some things can't be avoided. A very entertaining comedy."
The Angriest Man in Brooklyn,2014,5.7,A perpetually angry man is informed he has 90 minutes to live and promptly sets out to reconcile with his family and friends in the short time he has left.,"A remake of the 1997 Israeli film, The 92 Minutes of Mr. Baum, 'The Angriest Man in Brooklyn' is a fairly entertaining film, that doesn't eat your brains.'The Angriest Man in Brooklyn' Synopsis: A curmudgeonly man is mistakenly told that he has 90 minutes to live by his doctor and promptly sets out to reconcile with his wife, brother and friends in the short time he believes he has left.'The Angriest Man in Brooklyn' begins well & maintains a certain pace till the end. Its never spectacular, but its never too bad, either. Quite simply put -- Some of it works, some of it doesn't.Daniel Taplitz's Screenplay balances between comedy & drama, ably. Phil Alden Robinson's Direction is passable. Cinematography is good. Editing is also crisp.Performance-Wise: Robin Williams enacts 'The Angriest Man in Brooklyn', with effortless ease. The Oscar-Winning Actor doesn't miss a single beat. Mila Kunis is impressive. Peter Dinklage is superb, while Melissa Leo is her usual self.

The Wolverine,2013,6.7,"Wolverine comes to Japan to meet an old friend whose life he saved years ago, and gets embroiled in a conspiracy involving yakuza and mutants.","Reviewers say 'The Wolverine' garners praise for Hugh Jackman's performance and deeper character exploration. However, the film faces criticism for its predictable plot, pacing issues, and underdeveloped supporting characters. The action scenes, though visually striking, are often repetitive. The inconsistent use of Wolverine's healing factor frustrates some viewers. Despite these issues, it is considered an improvement over its predecessor."
X-Men: Days of Future Past,2014,7.9,The X-Men send Wolverine to the past in a desperate effort to change history and prevent an event that results in doom for both humans and mutants.,"Reviewers say 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' is acclaimed for its ambitious time-travel plot, merging the original trilogy with 'First Class'. Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, and Michael Fassbender deliver standout performances. Themes of destiny and redemption are explored, with impressive action sequences and special effects. Quicksilver's scenes are particularly praised. However, the complex plot can be confusing, and some characters are underutilized. Emotional depth and character development are strengths, though the ending and time-travel mechanics are criticized for being convoluted."
Watchmen,2009,7.6,"In a version of 1985 where superheroes exist, the murder of a colleague sends active vigilante Rorschach on the trail of a conspiracy that will change the course of history.","Reviewers say 'Watchmen' is acclaimed for its intricate characters, dark themes, and loyalty to the graphic novel. Performances, especially Jackie Earle Haley and Billy Crudup, are highlighted. Criticisms involve pacing, slow-motion effects, and plot deviations. Some find it lengthy and slow, others miss the source material's depth. Violence and graphic content elicit mixed reactions. Despite this, the film is celebrated for its visuals, direction, and its exploration of heroism and morality."

Under the leadership of President Coin and the advice of her trusted friends, Katniss spreads her wings as she fights to save Peeta and a nation moved by her courage.","Having put an end to The Hunger Games forever, President Alma Coin uses Katniss as a beacon for hope. A reluctant Katniss has only one thing on her mind, to save Peeta.I have to be honest, I have always struggled with this movie, it isn't bad, I just wish they could have got the story done in one go, I like the second part, I find this first half too fleshed out, it lacks any real content. It does get going, but later on, it's all build up for the second.The visuals are great, there are plenty of action sequences and explosions, and of course sets and costumes look great. Lawrence is very good once again, but the script doesn't offer her the range that Catching Fire did.Julianne Moore was excellent as President Coin I thought, very strong performance.I did enjoy that scene where Peeta turned, having been absent for most of the movie, it was good to see him put to good use.I liked that there was a message at the end for Philip Seymour Hoffman, RIP.6/10."
De Hobbit: de Woestenij van Smaug,2013,7.8,"The dwarves, along with Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf the Grey, continue their quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, their homeland, from the dragon Smaug.","While I enjoyed the first Hobbit film, it did feel like it left a bit to be desired. This was no surprise, as everything that I loved about the book was in the second half. I knew that I would be waiting for all the good stuff with the second and third films. And sure enough, the second film delivers where the first film didn't quite excite as much as I had wanted. While it isn't perfect and does unnecessarily deviate a bit, this is easily better than the first film, giving us a bigger, bolder adventure and a more interesting Bilbo Baggins this time around.Before I get to the good stuff, let me get my complaints out of the way. My biggest complaint are the unnecessary plot threads. There seems to be a big need for this series of films to tie into LotR, and I really don't understand why. A great deal of time is taken in this film to introduce us to things we already know the outcome of. We're, at points, taken away from the dwarfs and Bilbo to follow Gandalf as he goes off on his own adventure to uncover the growing evil of Sauron and his armies. Like the first film, it's completely unnecessary, but unlike that film, it's jarring. We're ripped from a fantastic adventure to a story that we don't really need to know and has no real relation to the dwarfs and their adventure. In fact, any time we're taken out of the company of the dwarfs, it almost feels cheap. The almost romance between Evangeline Lily's elf and the dwarf Kili feels something of the same, the whole lot of these stories coming off as filler in an effort to make time for three movies instead of just two. It feels like a stretch and brings a screeching halt to the momentum of the main story.That said, the rest of the film is an excellent and expertly crafted adaptation. There is a definite sense of character growth, especially from Bilbo, who seems to struggle with the power of the ring and it's greed. We already know where this goes, but it is none the less fascinating considering who he was when we first met him. The dwarfs seem to almost take a back seat here. They are less prominent, with the exception of Thorin and Balin, who take front and center. That isn't to say they aren't entertaining, as they usually are every time they are on screen. Thorin is the real standout though, as he goes through similar changes as Bilbo, which lends them an interesting comparison in their mutual struggles. The actors are all excellent once again in their respective roles, with Freeman once again being the standout. Evangeline Lily is also a pleasant surprise in an original role as an elf created for the film. She adds a much needed feminine touch to an otherwise predominantly male cast. She proves herself to be a fine silver screen presence and hopefully this will net her some further film roles.While the film does an excellent job of not simply being the middle film, something The Two Towers struggled with in the LotR trilogy, it is the action, set pieces, and effects which are the true stars. This may not be a LotR movie, but it's close. We almost immediately start out with a bang and it rarely lets up. Of course, much of what happens early on, as exciting as it may be, pales in comparison to it's explosive and lengthy climax. Smaug is quite possibly the best creation of any of the film, Hobbit or LotR. He is as awesome as you could have hoped for and Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent in the role. While effects have been applied to his voice to give it more boom, he does a fantastic job as the sneering, wise, and boastful dragon. Watching and listening to him face off against Bilbo is a delightful treat, and that is before we get to any fire breathing and chasing. What follows is a lengthy conclusion to the film that will excite and delight all. I have no qualms in saying that Smaug makes the entire film worth the admission of price. But don't go in expecting a solid conclusion. This is, after all, the second of a trilogy, so you can surely expect the film to leave you salivating for the next one.While this new Hobbit film still doesn't reach LotR heights, it is superior to the previous film, especially when it comes to being an enjoyable adventure. It feels like it matters to the trilogy and delivers on being an epic. And I simply can't rave enough about Smaug. If you didn't enjoy the first film, you may find yourself feeling about the same here. But at least this one has a cool dragon."
The Big Short,2015,7.8,"In 2006-2007 a group of investors bet against the United States mortgage market. In their research, they discover how flawed and corrupt the market is.","Reviewers say 'The Big Short' is a thought-provoking film about the 2008 financial crisis, praised for its strong performances and innovative use of celebrity cameos. However, some find its satire and fourth-wall breaks detract from the serious subject matter. The film's pacing and editing are criticized for causing confusion, yet it is generally regarded as important for highlighting systemic issues, though it simplifies the complexities of the crisis."
Magic Mike,2012,6.1,"A male stripper teaches a younger performer how to party, pick up women, and make easy money.","Steven Soderbergh's ""Magic Mike"" is short on needed magic. The promised backstage tale of male strippers conjures images of sexy men, pulsating music, and erotic choreography. Unfortunately, the expected companion piece to ""Flashdance"" or ""Footloose"" is not even ""The Full Monty."" Magic Mike, competently played by Channing Tatum, is a construction worker by day, a stripper by night, and a furniture designer by ambition. A fellow hard hat on the construction site, Adam, played by Alex Pettyfer, is drawn into Mike's stripper world by the lure of easy money and even easier sex. Little unexpected happens, and the audience for naked male flesh and sexual couplings is better served at the local porn shop.The dialog is lame and often delivered listlessly. Perhaps strippers and their friends are low-key characters and talk like Mike and his friends, but eyes glaze and brains go numb after nearly two hours spent in their company. A physically fit Matthew McConaughey looks almost cadaverous as Dallas, the strippers' tough manager. However, McConaughey is effective, and his scenes resuscitate the film when he is on screen, which is all too briefly. Despite his age, McConaughey has the vulgar moves, the erotic gyrations, and the sexual aura that the other supposed strippers lack.""Magic Mike"" drags on and seems longer than it is. Soderbergh inserts a few arty shots, but generally fails to even capture the excitement of a ""Flashdance,"" a glossy construction-worker-cum-dancer feature-length music video that moved to a beat and never bored. The music herein is forgettable at best, and the dancing owes more to Las Vegas posturing than Broadway or discotheques. Perhaps Soderbergh was the wrong director for the project, which was an odd choice for the man who made ""Traffic"" and ""Erin Brockovich."" Magic Mike's story is unexpectedly downbeat, and the angst of a frustrated furniture designer is low on entertainment value. While the film will likely draw and disappoint gay and female audiences, perhaps men can relate most to Mike and his checkered career in pursuit of a dream However, few straight men will venture into a movie with the advertising and subject matter of ""Magic Mike."""
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,2014,6.6,"When New York is put under siege by Oscorp, it is up to Spider-Man to save the city he swore to protect as well as his loved ones.","This film is getting too much hate by some people and too much love by others (including me), and it seems to be only based on the mental image each group has of spider-man and movie scripts in general.Those who love the soup opera aspects of Peter Park, hated, they missed the character grow, the motives of the villains (arguable) and complained for having too many story lines. On the other hand those who love comic spidey, loved, for all the stupid puns, the charisma and the of course the action. But the main complain is about the script, but understanding as a comic adaptation, it makes sense, the several sub-plots going on between each fight,the preface and Peter Parker/Spider-Man parallels objectives, it makes just like a regular comic (weekly or monthly) and less like a regular movie.But What can I say, I was expecting to see the real (mental image, again) Spider-Man on screen, the costume is really (a lot of emphasis here) beautiful, Andrew Garfield really is in the character, Emma Stone makes an active love interest, Dane DeHaan makes a 'realistic' Green Goblin and Paul Giamatti goes a over-the-top, more related to an usual Spider-Man Villain. The only big flaw is Jamie Foxx getting the spotlight just because Django, the character is lost in the movie, half-way between fun villain and real threat, shame because he is the main villain.Marc Webb got me, I'm gonna be the first in line for: The Amazing Spider-Man 3, Venom-Carnage, Sinister Six, maybe Spider-Woman (not confirmed yet), or any other release of a fun comic adaptation."
Baymax,2014,7.8,"A special bond develops between plus-sized inflatable robot Baymax and prodigy Hiro Hamada, who together team up with a group of friends to form a band of high-tech heroes.","Big Hero 6 is not among the best that Disney has ever done and it isn't flawless. But it is still very good and one of their best easily since the Renaissance. It did feel a little rushed at times and felt like it tried to do a little too much in the storytelling, as a result some ideas that were introduced like the science-is-good message gets lost. If it slowed down and explored a little less areas it would have improved things. The villain felt underdeveloped and his reveal came over as very obvious and forced as well.However, the animation is outstanding with lots of rich colours and textures, backgrounds that are incredibly detailed and sweet(but not in a cloying way) character designs. One of the best-looking recent Disney films definitely. The catchy and upbeat yet atmospheric and emotion-filled soundtrack and smart script are other things to like, as are the brisk(when not rushed) pacing and rousing if not exactly inventive action. While the story is not flawless, on the most part it's still a winner. Whatever originality it may lack, it more than compensates for that with fun and heart. There are plenty of funny moments(i.e. Stan Lee), and of the laugh-out-loud witty kind and even better is the emotional impact Big Hero 6 has. The brother-brother relationship is handled very affectingly, like between Anna and Elsa in Frozen it was Disney trying to explore a different kind of relationship than they did before and it succeeds in that respect.Sure Big Hero 6 sometimes takes a dark tone but not in a heavy or inappropriate way, there's no reason why anybody should be disturbed by that. The characters are not the most developed ones there ever were and as said more should have been done with the villain, but they're still engaging. Hiro is a very flawed but still likable main protagonist and his relationship between brother Tadashi is beautifully done. The most memorable character for me though was Baymax, he has to be one of Disney's most adorable characters, along with Maximus(Tangled) and Sven(Frozen) he has one of their cutest since the Renaissance. As well as being beautifully designed he displays a lot of laughs and a wide range of emotions, literally the film's heart and soul. The voice work from all(I just wish that James Cromwell had more to do) is very good, with particular mention going to Scott Adsit and his voice is a good match with Ryan Potter's deeply felt Hiro. All in all, not one of Disney's best but one of their better ones of the past 15 years. Haven't seen all the Best Animated Feature nominees but while this viewer did prefer How to Train Your Dragon 2 and the un-nominated Lego Movie they still felt that Big Hero 6 was still a good enough film to merit an Oscar nomination. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
Whiplash,2014,8.5,A promising young drummer enrolls at a cut-throat music conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor who will stop at nothing to realize a student's potential.,"Reviewers say 'Whiplash' delves into ambition and obsession through a toxic student-teacher dynamic. Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons deliver intense performances, highlighting the sacrifices for artistic excellence. Critics praise the film's technical achievements but find its depiction of jazz and mentorship unrealistic. Concerns arise over the glorification of abusive behavior and the ambiguous moral resolution. Despite these issues, 'Whiplash' is celebrated for its gripping narrative and jazz score."
Cinderella,2015,6.9,"When her father unexpectedly dies, young Ella finds herself at the mercy of her cruel stepmother and her scheming stepsisters. Never one to give up hope, Ella's fortunes begin to change after meeting a dashing stranger.","I didn't know this movie existed until recently.. and what a pleasant surprise! From the great casting (and each and everyone one of their lovely portrayals, expressions and interactions), to the colors, clothing, sets, music, locations and developments.After every photorealistic disappointment from Disney since Alice in Wonderland (2010), to find a lovely adaptation of the original that isn't flat or insulting and with a damn good script as a foundation! That is to say, that if you are going to remake these movies, at least make them ""good"".. not worse (like they did Maleficent, Aladdin and the Lion King amongst others).This has a fresh and lovely start. The family setting of fair standing, with a context of love and caring relationships, followed by loss and moving on. It feels different.. although if you've seen Ella Enchanted from 2004, you'd probably say I'm very mistaken. Still, the direction it takes gives you uncertainty of its development. Almost everything is more realistic. That is, until it doesn't.. for a moment. Personally, I feel this story would have been perfect had it kept its course with some elements left out. While still good, my expectations for it begot higher expectations. You'd have to see it to understand.. the way it unravels feels known but unique.Still, I wasn't disappointed. It feels magical and lovely still. I particularly enjoyed Richard, and therefore his interactions with Lily (both leads). And every other character isn't underwritten or annoying or wasted. It's hard to find consistency, and for everything displayed to matter.Easy recommendation for any Disney fan.. specially for those disillusioned with what we've gotten as of late."
Network,1976,8.1,"A television network cynically exploits a deranged former anchor's ravings and revelations about mass media for its own profit, but finds that his message may be difficult to control.","Reviewers say 'Network' is acclaimed for its biting satire on television, exploring themes like media manipulation and corporate greed. Its foresight on reality TV and societal decay is often highlighted. Peter Finch and Faye Dunaway deliver standout performances, though some find the film uneven with slow pacing, preachy dialogue, and an exaggerated plot. Despite these flaws, 'Network' is celebrated for its enduring relevance and dark commentary on media."
Total Recall,2012,6.2,"A factory worker, Douglas Quaid, begins to suspect that he is a spy after visiting Rekall - a company that provides its clients with implanted fake memories of a life they would like to have led - goes wrong and he finds himself on the run.","Despite all of the action sequences, Total Recall is pretty bland. They've removed all of the fun, all of the camp and all of the Mars out of this remake and what is left isn't as interesting. The futuristic technology is interesting and Kate Beckinsale actually makes a good villain, but this movie just goes to show that better visual effects don't make a better film."
RoboCop,2014,6.1,"In 2028 Detroit, when Alex Murphy, a loving husband, father and good cop, is critically injured in the line of duty, the multinational conglomerate OmniCorp sees their chance for a part-man, part-robot police officer.","Up front I'll confess. I'm one of those curmudgeony dinosaurs who takes it as a personal affront to my long gone adolescence whenever anyone dares to remake an 80s flick. I mean, heck, movies aside, NOTHING can compare to how stylin' I was in my parachute pants & moussed up hair as I strutted in that movie theater with my gallon of Fresca, pop rocks & Fruit Stripe gum back in '87 to watch the cinematic event of the decade, Robocop. That alone, plus the fact that they don't make gum with real sugar anymore (communists!), makes me want to thumbs-down every remake of today.But you know what? This movie sorta rocks. I'll tell you why.First of all, the story is COMPLETELY different, so it can't even be considered a remake. I'm a firm believer that, much like Jimi Hendrix did when he covered ""Hey Joe"", if you're going to revisit someone else's work then do it completely differently. That's what the director did here. Only the basic premise remains: a lone, half-computerized ""Everyman"" decides to take on a criminal/corporate colossus while simultaneously struggling with his lost humanity.First off, Robocop 2014 is a much broader, more family-friendly film. Gone is the extreme, in-your-face violence and criminal depravity that worked so well in the original which was intended to disturb viewers on an emotional level (Veerhoven is king of cinematic satire). Whereas the old Robocop was known to pump lead into perpetrators' private parts, in this version Robocop uses a taser gun to take down most threats. Granted, it's a taser gun that packs enough juice to take down the jolly green giant, but the point is we don't see quite as much blood & guts.Instead of disturbing violence and hard-hitting satire, we get some very interesting political and philosophical spins. The idea of a robot police force is cleverly tied in with military drones and smart-warfare technology that's already in use today. The question being posed is: when we turn this same technology on ourselves (America) to police our own people, suddenly it seems bone-chillingly sick.Another new & interesting spin is the idea that Robocop is the personification of the existentialist debate. Do we have free will? Or is there some governing force that has written out our lives and ""choices"" already, and we are merely as Shakespeare said, a bunch of actors playing out roles? Robocop 2014 touches on this with the idea that Robo is actually hard-coded to behave as a machine with only the illusion that he has conscious will. THAT was a great philosophical angle which I actually wish the movie had spent another hour exploring. But I guess that would've taxed a lot of viewers' attention spans, so it was kept under the surface. Still it's something to ponder heavily as the movie unfolds.Special effects, action, costumes & gizmos are eye poppingly great. And I don't mean over-the-top cartoonish, either. They're great because the film does a nice job of keeping things real enough to make you think this scenario could actually happen. In the ""Behind the scenes"" bonus, a point is brought up that the director nixed a bunch of really cool scifi ideas (such as a motorcycle that transforms into a shell around Robo) because he didn't want the viewer to get lost in too much fantasy. The result is more of a straightforward crime drama or even political thriller than it is scifi.The acting. OK, for real, how can anyone fail with Michael Keaton (the first movie Batman) and Gary Oldman (Dracula) and, in a peripheral but awesomely hilarious parody role Samuel L Jackson (Pulp Fiction!) as the rabid fascist foul-mouthed host of a cable ""news"" show called The Novak Element. Oh gawd, fans of Veerhoven's satirical skewerings will LOVE this character. Relative newcomer Joel Kinnaman (Robo) does a great job, and old Robocop fans might notice some deliberate homages he makes to the original Peter Weller performance such as the way he always turns with his head first, then shoulders, then feet.I also must add a quick note about the music used in this film. There are several great homages to us aging fans with selections such as The Clash ""I Fought the Law"" and a great shoot-em-up scene that uses ""Hocus Pocus"" by Focus. And I think that approach sums up what this film is all about. It's not attempting to trample on our memories of the original Robocop, but rather, it acknowledges old fans while presenting something completely different and, in my opinion, worthwhile. Now if someone would only acknowledge my cool parachute pants I be flying high."
AVP2: Aliens vs. Predator 2 - Requiem,2007,4.6,"Warring Alien and Predator races descend on a rural Colorado town, where unsuspecting residents must band together for any chance of survival.","Reviewers say 'Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem' is a divisive film with intense action, gore, and creature effects, praised for its homage to the original 'Alien' and 'Predator' movies. Improved creature designs and more violent content are highlighted, yet criticisms include dark cinematography, lack of a compelling human story, and inconsistent lore. Despite these flaws, it is seen as an entertaining addition, especially for fans of the original franchises."
Cowboys & Aliens,2011,6.0,"A spaceship arrives in 1873 Arizona to take over the Earth, starting with the Wild West region. All that stands in their way: a posse of cowboys and natives.","Wow i enjoyed this, partially due to the negative reviews here on IMDb (thanks guys) and in part due to Harrison Ford clearly having more fun with a character than he has in a long time.Its not a perfect film and there are questions that could be asked of some of the plot points, but the questions, such as they are, would require irrelevant exposition, which would only serve to hobble the pace of what is essentially a ""Men (and Woman) on a mission"" movie.What really stands out for me were the scenes at the beginning of the film, Jon Favreau introduces the characters, locations and situations in such a manner that when the real threat manifests itself, despite the films title, it catches you as off guard as the characters are.The cast are all great, some nice character work from Clancy Brown and Keith Carradine. Daniel Craig brings the stoic, no nonsense aspects of his Bond to Jake and as i said earlier Harrison Ford obviously relishes the role of Dolarhyde.It reminds me of the films i used to enjoy about twenty years ago, that had lively pace, but were'nt frantic. The effects are special, but not overblown or overwhelming to the point where they become the focus thereby obviating any interest in the characters stories.I don't want to talk about the story too much and spoil it, i'd just urge you to go and watch it, because this movie is an honest attempt to try something a little different. Its not Superheroes, its not a TV show, its not a line of toys and its not cute animated whatevers. Its an unlikely, but successful fusion of two genres to produce a film with humour, drama, action and a refreshing amount of practical effects work. Give it a chance, i really was surprised how much i enjoyed it."
R.I.P.D.,2013,5.6,"In the afterlife, Nick Walker, a detective who used to work for the Boston Police Department, is hired by a director of a group of deceased police officers to fight against the renegade ghosts.","I don't understand all the hate for RIPD. I get that it's invariably gonna be compared with MiB because they share the same theme, but just because MiB is the superior movie doesn't mean RIPD isn't enjoyable. It has a great cast, good special effects, and an interesting premise. Take it for what it is.... If you go into it looking for a masterpiece, prepare for disappointment. If you just want to be entertained by a pretty good sci-fi movie with some solid laughs, try RIPD out. Just my 2 cents."
Conan the Barbarian,1982,6.9,A powerful warrior seeks to avenge the genocide of his people and the murder of his parents at the hands of a snake cult.,"When Conan came out in 1981, critics griped about its elephantine pacing and ponderous dialogue, and long stretches in which nothing much happened, giving evidence that they expected traditional action- adventure in the vein of, say, Sinbad. But director John Milius had set out to create something very different: an epic Aryan myth which translated the qualities of Wagnerian opera to cinema, and in large part he succeeded.Conan has a sweeping epic feel, and is heavily dependent upon and driven by its setting and music to a degree that is very rare. As important as the deeds of the legendary hero, which are shown in brief and violent spurts of action, are the place and the culture that shaped that legend. The journey that created the myth, in short, is equal to the myth itself, and this is the logic and justification for the setting-heavy approach taken by Milius. And Basil Poledouris' wonderful music, which starts out Wagnerian and brassy, but adds middle Eastern touches as Conan's journey takes him in that direction, tracks along with Conan to show up the breadth of his epic journey while celebrating his heroic achievements.Ultimately the story that gets told is somewhat less worthy of Milius' Wagnerian ambitions than are the music and the visuals, but the overall results more than justify the effort, especially when compared to the Italian sword and sandal knock-offs which followed this much copied but never equaled classic of the fantasy genre."
Kindergarten Cop,1990,6.3,"A tough cop must pose as a kindergarten teacher in order to locate a dangerous criminal's ex-wife, who may hold the key to putting him behind bars.","A neat blend of rom-com, cop movie, and feel good story-Arnold Schwarzenegger goes for the trifecta in this classic. This gruff, violent, no-holds-barred cop named John Kimble has to transform his physical image and his personality in order to find the wife of a known drug dealer. His pursuit leads him to a kindergarten class in Astoria, Oregon where the tough and scary gives way to the cute and cuddly.Not that this could have really happened it still made for a fun and sometimes funny movie. The kids were the real comedy because I've never found Schwarzenegger really funny. The movie ranged from edgy, to funny, to romantic, to cute and it displayed each adequately."
World Invasion: Battle Los Angeles,2011,5.7,A squad of U.S. Marines becomes the last line of defense against a global invasion.,"Everyone described this film as BLACK HAWK DOWN meets ALIENS and who am I to contradict public opinion . One thing I didn't notice in the reviews was similarity to the John Wyndham novel The Kraken Wakes . Meteors land in the ocean and very quickly alien incursions attack the coastline . One criticism of Wyndham's criminally underrated novel is that if an alien race was this advanced then there's no reason for them to be hostile down to evolutionary psychology . In simplistic terms a civilization alien or otherwise would have to evolve beyond petty tribalsitic squabbles and pool their resources in to conquering physics and mastering interstellar travel . In other words an advanced civilization should in theory be a non aggressive race not bent on conquestThis is speculation of course because there's no evidence that there's life on any other planet and the novels of John Wyndham are quickly forgotten as the laser bolts fly and the aliens emerge from the sea . This is a pity because I was expecting a bit more mystery and suspense allowing the story to breath before the aliens were revealed . It's still not really a great loss at this point because I was still very impressed by the epic scope and spectacle as the marines fly to Camp Pendleton via helicopter dodging airbursts caused by the aliens . As the action then takes place as a ground war in the ruins of LA I was reminded to a certain extent of BLACK HAWK DOWN . The problem after the initial fighting however is that the scale and scope stops and started reminding me of any Michael Bay film you care to mentionGoodbye epic scope and scale we had when the marines were airborne and hello to close up and elliptic editing done via shaky cam . One can understand director Jonathan Liebesman trying to do a sci-fi blockbuster in a realist style but we've seen too many films with "" blink and you'll miss it "" type editing and you'd think with the utter contempt that many movie fans hold Michael Bay in you'd think most directors would avoid this style rather than constantly embrace it , but no they still continue as if it's part of their job remit . Would I cynical in thinking in this case it's too disguise the fact that the aliens aren't all convincing if you look at them longer than a nanosecond ? Hmm CGI and blink and you'll miss it editing . You spend tens of millions of dollars on a movie and you don't bother hiring an editor or a screenwriter . Remind me why Hollywood producers live in big mansions with a swimming pool while there's so many people with potential living in poverty ?This is a the type of film like WORLD WAR Z that constantly gets pumped out by Hollywood where there's a germ of a good idea in there somewhere that blossoms in to a big headache inducing mess that makes for a great trailer but doesn't have any substance to sustain it for two hours . Obviously any idiot can be a Hollywood producer but it takes someone of relative intelligence to analyse if they want to spend money watching films like this at the cinema just because the trailer looked good . I'm glad I didn't spend money on a cinema ticket to watch this"
The Judge,2014,7.4,"Big-city lawyer Hank Palmer returns to his childhood home where his father, the town's judge, is suspected of murder. Hank sets out to discover the truth; along the way he reconnects with his estranged family.","""The Judge"" is one of those films that with decidedly lesser and less passionate talent could've been a more evident hot mess than it already is. In its current form, however, it's a rare hot mess that succeeds mostly because of the audacity and chemistry of its performers, on top of the entertaining content it provides us, despite its lengthy runtime (one-hundred and thirty-seven minutes minus credits).The film concerns Hank Palmer (Robert Downey, Jr.), an immensely successful, arrogant Chicago lawyer, who returns to his hometown of Carlinville, Indiana for his mother's funeral, leaving behind an unsatisfied wife who wants out of their marriage and a young daughter who knows a bit too much for her age. Upon returning to Carlinville, Hank reconnects with his two siblings and realizes all the reasons him and his father, Judge Joseph Palmer (Robert Duvall), have severed all ties to each other. Hank detests his father for not just his stubborn and sometimes vague natures, but his crooked sensibilities that often come off as brash and inhuman.Hank realizes he'll have to extend his stay in Carlinville when his father is suspected of murdering a man he sent to prison some years ago. After a long, emotional night at his wife's funeral, Joseph wakes up to find his car scratched with blood in the front-grill that matches the blood of the victim he hit, who was riding on the street on a bicycle. After being granted the ability by Joseph, Hank now has to go about defending his father, as he is up against the equally-renowned prosecutor Dwight Dickham (Billy Bob Thornton).I cannot proceed further into analysis until I recognize the beauty of Downey, Jr. and Duvall's chemistry and their individual performances. Both actors convey such a natural feeling of stubbornness and gusto that, when both men are in the room together, often occupied by tense arguing or bickering, ""The Judge"" electrifies the audience. Downey, Jr., even as he nears fifty, occupies the sensibilities and the mindset of a cocky frat boy in the best possible way, and Duvall, in his early-eighties, finds commendable energy in his role as the judge-turned-convict. When put together and given personalities that the men can convey in their sleep (Downey Jr.'s cocky, holier-than- thou attitude and Duvall's all-knowing attitude but occasionally vague intentions), the film explodes on screen.Then there's the man who is likely going to get little praise, due to his minimal involvement until the final act of the film, Billy Bob Thornton, doing the best Billy Bob Thornton performance possible. You know the type: confident, but not foolishly cocky, well-spoken, with a humble southern drawl, and groomed but mannered method to his madness. Right off the bat, we have three incredible talents gracing the screen at one time, which almost makes us forget how average and often cluttered the story really is.""The Judge"" suffers from the classic issue of having too many subplots. In my plot summation, I mentioned two (the divorce and the murder trial), yet that doesn't even scratch the film's surface of how many bases it attempts to hit. Aside from trying to play up the ""father never loved me"" storyline, ""The Judge"" attempts to build so much around the life of Hank that it can't keep up. We have a divorce, the rekindling of an old relationship, a possible deadbeat dad situation, a vague future, and that's not even considering the subplots and other features plaguing the other characters, like Joseph and his other two sons. There is simply too much occurring in ""The Judge"" to effectively appreciate everything it has to offer.Then there's the fact that the courtroom scenes of the film, unlike in ""Flight,"" back in 2012, which proved not to be something they were ostracized as prior to the film's release, which find themselves too lost in the affinity of theatricalities rather than realism. By this point, the whole film has taken a realistic, human focus to its story, and to see ""The Judge"" take on brazen obviousness in the way of courtroom shouting and disobedience finds ways to be offputting at times.Nonetheless, ""The Judge"" is, above all, an audience's film, meaning that most people who go to see this film will, in turn, love it, and find themselves reflecting on life, their family, and themselves. I'd be lying if I said this film didn't hit personal chords, depicting a troubled relationship between father-and-son that I have encountered in life countless times, with attitudes and stances greatly mirroring my own reality. For this reason, among the fact that the film's performances are truly something to take in and the film's human interest never loses sight despite a heavy dependence on storyline, I'm recommending ""The Judge"" to people as a solid piece of adult drama with a modern, human focus; we hardly ever get those anymore by someone who's name isn't Alexander Payne."
End of Days,1999,5.8,"At the end of the century, Satan visits New York in search of a bride. It's up to an ex-cop who now runs an elite security outfit to stop him.","END OF DAYS / (1999) **1/2 (out of four)By Blake French:""End of Days"" is the first movie to seriously argue that ""666"" the numerical sign of the devil, is actually a 999 upside-down. Since the film was first released in 1999, the movie could not resist to throw in that little contrivance. What can you expect from a movie when its premise is based on the concept that once every thousand years if Satan impregnates a woman during the hour from 11 p.m. to 12 a.m. on the last day of the millennium, she will give birth to the anti-Christ who will bring the world to an end? I am already thinking that the movie is vulnerable to logic (is the time given in Eastern Standard?) and it will make its own limitations at the convenience of plot. ""End of Days"" is particularly graphic in its use of violence, but never really scares us, even with such a horrifying premise like the end of humanity.Arnold Schwarzenegger has not made a good movie in a long time. First ""Jingle all the Way,"" then ""Batman & Robin,"" now we have a movie that bounces back and forth between action and concept. There are the standard ""action movie scenes,"" where a person sways from a helicopter in mid air, where a chase scene takes place at incredible heights, where someone grasps to a high window ledge, where a subway train crashes, where a massive fire erupts in Manhattan, and so on. There are also the false shocko moments followed with a sudden burst of loud, startling music: the its just a cat scene, its just another cop scene, its just a dream scene, its just your imagination scene, he's not really dead scene, and its just maggots suddenly growing out of an apple scene. The movie is also bound by philosophy. The action is focused towards Schwarzenegger saving the world, but he cannot do that all by himself, can he? Sure he can, if he can stop Satan (Gabriel Bryne), from impregnating Christine (Robin Tunney), who was born under the religious sign of a passing comet -- and based on her birth twenty years earlier during the sighting of that comet ¬ñ is the chosen mother of Satan's child.""End of Days"" begins with an intriguing, although plausible, premise. The bizarre events that transpire a few days before the end of the millennium immediately inspire our curiosity. The action sequences are also fine, intensified by thrilling music and a fast paced style. The movie opens on a good note, and the remainder of the action sequences are also quite exciting. The scenes also inspire a few questions. Satan kills many people in this movie, people just like the hero, so why doesn't he just finish Arnold Schwarzenegger off like he does with so many other characters. On the other side, Schwarzenegger shoots the devil, who pulls his shirt up so we can see the bullet holes immediately healing. When using a machine-gun, the ammunition flings the Prince of Darkness backward and puts him down before he attacks again. There are simply no rules to abide by here.""End of Days"" does not have a whole lot of explanation; it plays sort of like your run of the mill action picture with the gimmick of the week. There just is not a lot of true involvement or engagement after the premise. We do care about Arnold Swarzzenegger's character, and Gabrial Bryne is an especially convincing Satan. He is devilish, with fiendish appeal, proving that tranquillity is the most terrifying evil. Al Pachino did an equally diabolical job in ""The Devils Advocate,"" but Bryne is even more terrifying. Robin Tunney has nothing to do but exchange shameless subtext with Schwarzenegger's character. (""You're better than everyone else, just remember that."" ""I don't want to be better or worse, I just want to be normal."") She is more of a plot device than an actual character.Excellent convincing set designs appear frequently, especially near the end where the characters wander through dark chambers and dim hallways. Cinematography also adds a nice touch to the suspenseful, mysterious atmosphere, all done by the movie's director, Peter Hyams (""The Relic""). It is too bad such good filmmaking does not have a story fit enough to back it up. One more thing I just have to mention: Why do the cops always show up at the end of the movie, after the action is over. I am getting very tired of that."
Predators,2010,6.4,A group of elite warriors parachute into an unfamiliar jungle and are hunted by members of a merciless alien race.,"Reviewers say 'Predators' offers thrilling action sequences and impressive special effects, honoring the original film with its jungle setting and human-hunting concept. However, the plot is criticized for being predictable and unoriginal, with underdeveloped, clich√©d characters. The pacing and weak dialogue further detract from the narrative, causing disinterest. Despite these issues, the film provides enough excitement and nostalgia to entertain fans, making it a flawed yet enjoyable addition to the franchise."
Steve Jobs,2015,7.2,"Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution, to paint a portrait of the man at its epicenter. The story unfolds backstage at three iconic product launches, ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac.","... in that you can argue about almost every stroke in the painting, yet when you stand back a few feet from the work, you realize that this is a more accurate portrayal of Steve Jobs than any photograph could be.For example, Michael Fassbender looks nothing like Steve Jobs did at any point in his adult life, sounds nothing like Steve Jobs did. Yet, by the end of the film you feel that you are looking right at the man. Why? Because every incident portrayed sounds EXACTLY like something Steve Jobs would have done or said even if the entire incident never happened.Kate Winsett gave an Oscar worthy performance as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marketing expertise and confidante, if he had any confidante at all. She acts as his conscience, his anchor, yet she actually wasn't there for a third of the film. Hoffmann retired before Jobs went back to Apple. As for Seth Rogan as Steve Wosniak, what can I say. He blew me away as he stood toe to toe with Fassbender in a show down that took my breath away with its intensity, and he stole the entire scene from Fassbender, proving he is much more than just the comic relief of Judd Apatow films.Jeff Daniels as the conventional CEO John Sculley, recruited by Jobs to deal with a most unconventional visionary in a pioneering industry, absolutely nails the part. The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done.As for the plot? It takes place entirely at three product launches - the Mac in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998, and the central theme is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, the paternity of whom he did not come to terms with for years. Of course, if Jobs had even one product launch like the ones in the film with everybody he's ever known approaching and reproaching him, Jobs would have had security like the secret service at every launch afterwards.So don't approach this like a documentary, instead approach it like the art it was meant to be and I think you'll enjoy it greatly. And regardless of what others say, I think it gives the most humane portrayal of Jobs I've seen on film. Strongly recommended."
My Life in Ruins,2009,5.9,A disgruntled tour guide in Greece gains an unexpected new outlook on life thanks to one of the people on what she intends to be her last tour.,"I was really excited to see this movie after having loved My Big Fat Greek Wedding for so long. I was VERY happy with this movie! If you want to go on vacation, but don't have the money, I would suggest watching this movie! The comedy is great in it, although some of it can be a bit redundant and childish (bus drivers name is Poupi Kakas). Just like any other romantic comedy, it's pretty predictable, but who even cares! All romantic comedies have the same skeletal structure that make us giggle and smile in our seats! This movie seriously had me laughing out loud. You will honestly fall in love with Greece whether or not you've ever been there. Not to mention, you will fall in love with bus driver Poupi (Alexis Georgoulis), who is EXTREMELY hot! Definitely a movie worth renting, watching, and buying! I can't get enough of it! Another great movie from Nia Vardalos."
Men,2015,6.7,"Through getting to know their unknown family, two outcast brothers discover a horrible truth about themselves and their relatives.","Mads Mikkelsen has had quite an interesting career so far. What? You don't know who he is? That must mean that you're not up to date on your Danish cinema, or you don't like James Bond, or don't watch much TV¬Ö or all three. Mikkelsen is a Danish actor who is probably best known in the U.S. for playing the title character in NBC's ""Hannibal"" ‚Äì and as the villain Le Chiffre in the 2006 Daniel Craig-led Bond reboot ""Casino Royale"". But, like most successful actors, Mikkelsen had to work his way up to such notable parts. As a young man, he spent ten years as a ballet dancer. In the mid-1990s, he began acting in high-profile films and TV shows in his native Denmark. The New York Times calls him ""a face of the resurgent Danish cinema"". Public opinion polls often crown him the sexiest man in Denmark, while his acting talent has earned him numerous Best Actor awards at film festivals around the world. More recently, in 2014, Mikkelsen played a Danish immigrant in the American West in the excellent, but underseen ""The Salvation"", and in 2015, he appeared in one of Rhianna's music videos. 2016 has him in Marvel's ""Doctor Strange"" and ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"". Very interesting indeed. ""Interesting"" is an appropriate but more loaded term when us to describe Mikkelsen's film ""Men & Chicken"" (NR, 1:44).Mikkelsen stars as Elias who, along with his half-brother, Gabriel (David Dencik), seems a little short-changed in the brains department ‚Äì and NO-changed when it comes to looks and social skills. When their father dies, they learn that they were both adopted and that their biological father lives on the tiny (fictional) Danish island of Ork. When Elias and Gabriel go to Ork in search of their father, they come across three more half-brothers, Gregor (Nikolaj Lie Kaas), Franz (S√∏ren Malling) and Josef (Nicolas Bro), who live together in a dilapidated former sanitarium which is overrun by barn animals. And it seems that Gregor, Franz and Joseph have the same ""challenges"" as Elias and Gabriel, if not more so.When Elias and Gabriel show up at the home of their other three brothers and announce who they are, Gregor, Franz and Josef beat Elias and Gabriel. After regrouping at the home of the town's mayor (Ole Thestrup) and his unmarried daughter (Kirsten Lehfeldt), Elias and Gabriel return to their brothers' home the next day to try again to get Gregor, Franz and Josef to talk to them. Another beating ensues, but Elias and Gabriel turn the tables, leading Gregor, Franz and Josef to grudgingly welcome their long-lost brothers into their home. But getting to meet their father is harder than Elias and Gabriel expected.Getting to know their newfound brothers is no picnic either. Besides letting barn animals roam freely throughout their home, Gregor, Franz and Josef interact with each other very strangely. They fight over who eats off of which plate at dinner, they cuddle together for a bedtime story each night, and if any of the brothers breaks a family rule, he has to sit in a metal cage outside. Oh, and sometimes the brothers change into tennis whites and play badminton on a makeshift indoor court. Gregor, Franz and Josef also have an especially unusual relationship with the larger animals that live outside the house. After being stymied in their efforts to meet their father, Elias and Gabriel notice some¬Ö unique-looking chickens roaming about, which makes them wonder even more about who their father is and what he's into.""Men & Chicken"" is¬Ö interesting (in an odd way) and can be entertaining¬Ö depending on your taste in movies. RogerEbert.com summarizes this film as ""a hybrid of 'The Three Stooges' comedy and the lunacy of 'The Island of Dr. Moreau'"". It's an apt characterization for what is a tough film to describe. It includes comic violence, bizarre situations, gross-out humor, very dark comedy and even some sweetness. It's fun to see Mikkelsen play so well against type, while the physical appearance of all five brothers is both repulsive and magnetic. As individuals, each character is a rail car which has gone off the tracks. As a whole, this group of people is a train wreck, but it's nearly impossible to look away. Like that proverbial human train wreck, you may find yourself wanting to keep watching out of a morbid sense of curiosity. Many will find this movie too ""weird"", but some will find it irresistible. ""B"""
Monsieur Chocolat,2016,7.0,"The rise and fall of the famous clown Chocolat, the first black circus performer who revolutionised the stagnant circus acts and conquered Paris of the Belle √âpoque with his exuberance and originality.","This is a terrific film, with superb performances and direction, based upon the amazing but tragic true life story of Rafael Padilla, known as 'Chocolat', a black colonial slave who escaped to France as a child and became famous there as a circus clown. The director is Roschdy Zem, a well known actor in France who has only directed four films. He directs this film with such thorough professionalism that one could readily believe that he had really directed forty rather than four. The two lead actors are Omar Sy (that being a Senegalese surname, but he was born in France), who plays Chocolat, and James Thi√©rr√©e, who plays the older clown who discovers him, trains him, and becomes his partner, known as Footit. I must point out immediately that this is the same James Thi√©rr√©e who is such a genius stage performer, who tours the world with astounding surrealistic circus acts, and is perhaps the most highly regarded person of his kind in the world. He is the grandson of Charlie Chaplin and looks exactly like him (I mean Chaplin in real life, not 'the Little Tramp'). I first saw James and his sister Aur√©lie (another well known solo performer now) perform onstage when they were tiny children, appearing with their parents, Victoria Chaplin and Jean-Baptiste Thi√©rr√©e. Of all the Chaplin children, Victoria is the one who carried on the pure Chaplin talents for mime and acrobatics with the utmost genius, and her son has even surpassed her. Victoria's most astonishing feat in her own touring circus act was to fold herself up so that she could be shut into a moderately-sized suitcase! They really are an amazing family (and in Victoria's case, easy perhaps to take on holiday in the baggage rack). But Victoria and her husband are very, very private. They do not mix in the Paris world of celebs at all, and when I first had to contact her about something, two Paris celebs who 'knew everybody' and I thought could help me find her told me 'No one knows them.' James however seems to have an infinite number of friends who cluster around him enthusiastically, smothering him with admiration and bonhomie. He shows no signs of being surly or grumpy in his person, so it is all the more remarkable how wholly convincing he is in this film as Footit, a man who was always depressing and surly. In other words, James is a superb actor as well as everything else that he is. Omar Sy is magnificent as Chocolat, as he effortlessly glides between pathos and wild slapstick comedy. He too is a leading talent in France. So the film works, and comes together extremely well. Because James and Omar Sy are naturally practised and skilled at what they are doing, their circus acts are incredible. James not only plays someone who is, but himself is, a thorough circus pro who can do anything and everything, and has done so in public since at least the age of five or six. He can do clowning, acrobatics, high wire, trapeeze, mime, you name it. And he writes and plans and directs all his own shows with his small troupe. He is what is called THE REAL THING, and so is this film."
Macbeth,2015,6.6,"Macbeth, the Thane of Glamis, receives a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland. Consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife, Macbeth murders his king and takes the throne for himself.","I recently saw Macbeth with Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard and directed by Justin Kurzel and is easily my number 1 film of the year so far. While the Shakespearean dialogue may be hard to follow at times, it doesn't matter as this film is a visual masterpiece and not only i the way of shot types but also in the use of colour (which the end scene uses in a truly jaw dropping sequence). The cinematography in Macbeth is truly something to marvel at and is perfectly accompanied by magnificent performances from the 2 leads and also the rest of the cast. Fassbender was born to play this role and portrays Macbeth in a powerful and emotionally engrossing way and Cotillard is a beautiful and faultless Lady Macbeth (she has a great monologue in one scene which gave me goosebumps). Another element that I loved was the score, wonderfully haunting and powerful and matches the scenery and setting of the film. Overall, Do. Not. Miss. This. It is spectacular and I've probably hyped it up too much now but what ever its great. If I had to fault it I would saw that there are some iconic lines from the original play that aren't used in the film which was disappointing but it probably wouldn't have fit with the tone so maybe it was for the best."
Asphalte,2015,7.0,"Improbable encounters bring tenderness, laughter and compassion to a world of urban alienation.","We are all astronauts - so sounds the German title. The astronauts in our own galaxies.

Quiz Show,1994,7.5,"A young lawyer, Richard Goodwin, investigates a potentially fixed game show. Charles Van Doren, a big time show winner, is under Goodwin's investigation.","The ratings of 1950's quiz show `21' are in freefall due to the dominance of dorky Jew Herbie Stempel.  The sponsors and network owners put pressure o the producers to replace him.  When WASP Charles Van Doren comes to audition for another show they offer to ask him the questions that he already answered at the practice.  Herbie is told to take a dive and Van Doren becomes an audience draw.  However when Herbie starts making noise about a fix, a congress employee, Dick Goodwin, decides to go after the network.This is a glossy, professional piece of work that sadly was never as huge as hit as it deserved to be (probably not enough explosions for the US audience).  The story is based on a true story that happened in the 50's and it's used here partly as a bit of history but also as a look at television in terms of it's most basic desire to sell and entertain at any costs ¬ñ if that means fixing shows or getting the `right' ethnic groups on screen then s be it.  It is effective on that level because it's hard to imagine anything has changed since 1950.  The actual human drama comes between Van Doren and Stempel ¬ñ the film makes them both real people, neither good nor bad but having a bit of both.Turturro is the best thing in this film.  His Herbie has so many levels which he must touch throughout and he does them all well ¬ñ whether it's humour, pride, anger or realisation.  Fiennes is good but at times I did find it hard to be sympathetic with a WASP born into a lofty family who gets more given to him.  That said Fiennes did him well.  Morrow was a strange choice ¬ñ famous at the time for Northern Exposure, he does a weird performance here ¬ñ almost doing an impression of what he thinks a tough Noo Yark investigator would be like.  The supporting cast is filled out with quality so deep that even the extras are famous now! (Calista Flockhart turns up briefly).  David Palmer and Hank Azaria are good as 21's producers, Christopher Mcdonald is good as the host ¬ñ people like Griffin Dunne, Mira Sorvino, Timothy Busefield and Barry Levinson come and go, and Martin Scorsese has a wicked role as the money behind the scandal.It works on many levels ¬ñ at it's most basic it is a true story of great interest, at best it lets you see how television works and how men with money can rarely be reached for any wrong doing.  Working on so many levels this is a polished professional drama that involves from start to finish."
300: Rise of an Empire,2014,6.2,"Greek general Themistocles of Athens leads the naval charge against invading Persian forces led by mortal-turned-god Xerxes and Artemisia, vengeful commander of the Persian navy.",How the hell did the producers manage to take a superb movie and savagely sodomize it with this emetic sequel.. Bloody hell.
Adventureland,2009,6.8,"In the summer of 1987, a college graduate takes a 'nowhere' job at his local amusement park, only to find it's the perfect course to get him prepared for the real world.","There will be a backlash against ""Adventureland"", or at least a disappointed reaction from some. The reason being that the film was marketed as another raunchy-sweet comedy from the Apatow empire, when in fact it has almost nothing to do with those films, and is very different from most of writer/director Greg Mottola's previous film ""Superbad"" (which is great in its own way, but it's nothing like this film). It is a tender, intimate romance surrounded by goofball humor, but the extent of the 'dirty jokes' in this movie is Jesse Eisenberg's character James getting out of the pool at a house party with an erection.The movie is a sentimental (not sappy, mind), very personal, journey through the summer of 1987 for recent college grad and deep thinker James Brennan (played superbly by Jesse Eisenberg), whose plans for the summer fall apart (due to Reaganomics affecting his father's income) resulting in him having to get a crappy job at the titular amusement park. There he meets Em, played by Kristen Stewart, and the romance, which is the focus of the film, begins. This is very, very far removed from the slob-meets-babe formula common in comedies in recent years. James is a virgin, true, a 22 year old one at that, but that has far more to do with the character's tentative nature than any 'quest' to get laid (ala ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", which works on its own terms of course, but is again nothing like ""Adventureland""), and he is far from bad looking. Em isn't a dolled-up 'hot chick' with perfectly styled hair and perfect style, she's moderately well-dressed and naturally beautiful, but wears makeup in a grand total of two scenes, and is actually NOT the 'babe' in the film (that's Margarita Levieva as Lisa P, who, though the 'babe', is not the sought-after one).I am finding it hard to describe exactly why I loved this film as much as I did, but I think it mostly comes down to subtle, wonderful writing by Mottola, who was obviously telling a personal story here and did a great job of it. The screenplay is a funny, poignant take on post-collegiate angst and love, with some elements of social satire, and its focus is one of the most memorable and wonderful romances in quite some time. This romance makes Stewart's breakthrough hit ""Twilight"" seem even more offensively dumb, because of just how real it is.Mottola, who absolutely nailed ""Superbad"" as a director, does even more with ""Adventureland"". His work with the actors is perhaps most notable. Bill Hader does what he did in ""Superbad"" and Matt Bush plays a slapstick role as Tommy Frigo, but everyone else is given more emotional poignancy and range to work with. Ryan Reynolds has abandoned his trademark smarmy shtick for a straight role in the film. As noted by Nathan Rabin in his review of ""Adventureland"", in a lesser film Reynolds (a failed attempt at a 'rock star' who is in an unhappy marriage and is having an affair with Em, and who is a loser to everyone but the deadbeats younger than him at the amusement park) would be a villain, James Brennan's adversary in a typical love triangle. In ""Adventureland"" he's a real person, and a rather tragic character. Not a nice guy, not a bad guy either. Martin Starr is great in the main supporting role as Joel. Mottola's direction is fantastic visually as well, with every scene brimming with intensity when it needs to be and the comedic timing again excellent. His use of music is absolutely spot-on, and if you thought the funky greatness of the ""Superbad"" soundtrack was good wait until you hear this low-key but incredible soundtrack made up almost entirely by great 80's pop songs (and not the mainstream garbage). Great musical score by Yo La Tengo as well.The film is ultimately such a massive success I think due to Kristen Stewart. I knew she was a capable actress but did not know that she was this terrific. She is transformed into Em for the entirety of the film, and is overwhelmingly intense for the entirety of her performance, whether the raw (but not even close to raunchy) sexuality of her scenes with Eisenberg (and boy do they have a rare sort of chemistry) or the understated sadness of her scenes with Reynolds. Eisenberg and Stewart are so wonderfully understated with their performances that their romance feels realer than anything I've seen since Zooey Deschanel and Dan Schneider in David Gordon Green's ""All the Real Girls"". This might be a familiar journey but the treatment of Reynolds' character is only one thing Mottola does different from the John Hugheses of the world. Everything about this film is just more real and more understated than so much of what we've seen done with similar things.The film has one or two scenes where plain lust is the focus, and absolutely none where the movie becomes about sex jokes. That James is a virgin is a side note, part of the character and nothing more. It couldn't be less about James wanting to bed Em, it couldn't be more about him being totally in love with her. Although critics are falling over themselves to praise the film (89% on RottenTomatoes at the time I'm writing this and a score in the high 70's on Metacritic) some have called it 'ordinary'. Perhaps much of the public will agree with that minority of the critics, but the film thrives on capturing 'ordinary moments'. The simple beauty of James, Em, and Joel watching fireworks on the 4th of July or a marijuana-fueled bumper car round scored to ""Just Like Heaven"" by The Cure. That's what this film is about. It's wonderful, it's beautiful, and if it's not a sleeper hit this year then it will eventually become a cult classic. It's something special, that much I know for sure."
Silicon Valley,,8.5,"Follows the struggle of Richard Hendricks, a Silicon Valley engineer trying to build his own company called Pied Piper.","Reviewers say 'Silicon Valley' is acclaimed for its sharp satire and humor, offering insightful commentary on the tech industry. The show captures the eccentricities and absurdities of Silicon Valley, highlighting themes of competition and ethical dilemmas. Thomas Middleditch and T.J. Miller deliver standout performances, though some critics note reliance on stereotypes and repetitive plots. The departure of Miller's character impacts the show's comedic element. Despite mixed opinions on the ending, 'Silicon Valley' is celebrated for its entertainment and social commentary."
Zootropolis,2016,8.0,"In a city of anthropomorphic animals, a rookie bunny cop and a cynical con artist fox must work together to uncover a conspiracy.","Reviewers say 'Zootopia' delves into themes of prejudice, discrimination, and societal biases, reflecting real-world issues. It promotes unity, acceptance, tolerance, and overcoming stereotypes. The film encourages challenging assumptions, persevering through adversity, and recognizing shared humanity. It also critiques systemic corruption and stresses integrity in leadership. The narrative highlights perseverance and pursuing dreams despite societal expectations and obstacles, making it both thought-provoking and entertaining."
Jupiter Ascending,2015,5.3,A genetically engineered soldier informs a young woman of her extraordinary destiny.,"I'm not sure how to start this review so I'll just get right into it: This movie isn't good. It makes no sense. There is no room to get immersed in this world because there is no story to relate to. It's all just stuff happening; fluff. Beautiful, well made fluff mind you, but at its core this movie is a steaming hot mess.Here's the plot from what I gathered: Mila Kunis is suddenly the majesty of the Earth and has to protect it from a bunch of rich douchebags that live in Jupiter's atmosphere who want to use it for harvesting grounds or something. It's a dumb plot, and every scene that tries to move the plot forward is a scene wasted. The only interesting parts of this movie are the visuals and Channing Tatum's character, but even he is given absolutely no character development. He's just a badass space agent, or something. I don't even remember.The characters end up the same way they began - there was no journey to redemption or revelation for anyone. It was just do this, do that, stop this, go home, the end. And they try to include multiple stories, like Mila Kunis' relationship with her family (boooring); Caine (Tatum) and Stinger's (Sean Bean) history (wholly underdeveloped), the whole villain arc...The villains in this movie are spoiled brats. Seriously. They're not scary, they're not intimidating, there was no point in the movie where I was like ""oh man sh*t is about to go down""; there was just no intrigue. Their motives were all over the place. It's not worth trying to piece together every plot point they throw into the movie because it will just lead to confusion and disappointment, and eventually frustration when you realize how much potential was wasted in creating this massive universe. The lizards looked really cool. Why not have more of them? Oh we're just going to focus on the playboy brat now, okay.I really wanted to care about this universe. It has a Star Wars vibe in parts, like the ""royal"" wedding scene and the space battles, but there were no good characters to experience this adventure with. You're just watching things happen with no consequences, or at least none you cared about.The acting was fine in this movie. Channing Tatum and Sean Bean in particular gave great performances, and Eddie Redmayne as the primary antagonist was decent as well. Yeah, he's an Academy Award winner, and as much as I hate to say it I have not seen The Theory of Everything yet but I loved him in Les Mis so I was really hoping he would save this movie. Unfortunately the material he's given is absolute garbage, so in an effort to make the character stand out, Redmayne give him a weird, eerie, whisper voice that was akin to a hundred year old man trying to force words out from the back of his throat. But hey, I think it worked. The guy is completely unlikeable so might as well give him a unique trait to remember him by. Good on Mr. Redmayne because he succeeded. The only things I will remember about this movie are the cool visuals, the wasted potential, and his creepy voice.Don't see this movie. Unless you want to see some really great CGI for a couple hours, which can be found in much better places by the way, you won't find anything worth salvaging from Jupiter Ascending. It was a nice effort but ultimately a swing and a miss."
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,1964,8.3,"A mentally unstable American general orders a hydrogen bomb attack on the Soviet Union, triggering a path to global nuclear holocaust that a war room full of politicians and generals frantically tries to stop.","Reviewers say 'Dr. Strangelove' is celebrated for its dark comedy and Cold War satire. The film is lauded for its sharp humor, Peter Sellers' versatile performance, and critique of military and political incompetence. Themes of war, nuclear absurdity, and unchecked power are prominent. Despite some finding the humor excessive, it is largely seen as a timeless classic. Kubrick's direction and the clever script are often highlighted as strengths."
"Hail, Caesar!",2016,6.3,A Hollywood fixer in the 1950s works to keep the studio's stars in line.,"HAIL CAESAR! (""A Story of the Christ"", as we are told in the title card) is one of those offbeat gems that I have no doubt grows in affection with repeated viewings. Folks here complain that it's not a laugh-a-minute farce, that it's not this, that it's not that...Here's what it *is*: the film version of RADIO DAYS.Just like Allen made a loving pastiche of radio at its height in the 1940s, so have the Coens done for film at the tail end of its Silver Screen era, when studios manipulated its contract players and worked the media to prevent the ""unfortunate"" aspects from being revealed to an audience that just wanted escapism fantasy. Josh Brolin is the tightly-wound studio ""head of physical production"", an enforcer who's being seduced by a potential job with Lockheed to oversee work on the atom bomb. Before he can come to a decision about whether or not take it, he has to deal with the sudden disappearance of the slightly disconnected-from-reality George Clooney (who looks like he's having a blast in this, especially in the final scene of his big budget sword-and-sandel Jesus epic). Along the way, we see the Coens' take on Esther Williams, Carmen Miranda, Gene Kelly, and a host of other stars from the era...... and this is what makes the film so damn much fun. It's not about the story, it's about how the Coens are celebrating the films we have perhaps idealized a bit too much: Esther Williams' underwater ballets and Gene Kelly in NYC for 24 hours and Gary Cooper trying to play it in a toney, high-class period drama. There are so many references to the great films of the day that if you blink, you'll miss a few ‚Äî they follow fast and furious and sometimes with little more than a sly wink. If you are an old time movie buff, you will love this film to tiny little bits. If not... well, you probably wont enjoy it all that much.But then the Coens probably didn't make it for you, did they..."
Eddie the Eagle,2015,7.3,"The story of Eddie Edwards, the notoriously tenacious British underdog ski jumper who charmed the world at the 1988 Winter Olympics.","The British love a plucky loser. ""Eddie the Eagle"" tells the astonishing but true story of everyman plasterer Eddie Edwards who qualified for, and then competed in, the Calgary Olympics in 1988 (probably most famous for those other plucky losers ‚Äì the Jamaican bobsleigh team of Disney's ""Cool Runnings"" fame). I have absolutely no idea how the traditionally more success-driven and competitive American audience will see it, but the packed English showing I attended all clearly loved this film as a feel-good classic.The film starts with Eddie's childhood, struggling out of leg braces to try to pursue his Olympic dream with no success whatsoever. (Excellent performances here by brothers Tom and Jack Costello who set-up the tone for the film). His battle is not just against his lack of skill: whilst his mother (Jo Hartley) is quietly supportive, his father Terry (Keith Allen) is ‚Äì not unreasonably it must be said ‚Äì hugely frustrated at his son's fanciful ideas, wanting him to follow in the family plastering tradition with the same zeal. (The gulf in ambition is vast ‚Äì Eddie: ""Didn't you have a dream when you were younger Dad?""; Terry: ""Yes, plastering"".)Eventually Eddie finds a sport he is half decent in (by British standards!): downhill skiing, but is thwarted in following his Olympic dreams by smarmy and sneering Olympic selector Dustin Target, played by Tim McInnerny (from ""Black Adder"" and ""Notting Hill""¬Ö someone who has rather cornered the market on 'smarmy and sneering'). It is then that he exploits ancient rules in the UK Olympic playbook to try to qualify in the discipline of ski-jumping: something no one has done since the 1920's. Linking up in Austria with an alcohol-infused coach and ex- jumper Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman), Eddie faces the terrors of the 40m and then 70m jumps to try to learn the sport (16 years too late).This film has been long in gestation, with both Steve Coogan and Rupert Grint originally earmarked for the role. But Matthew Vaughn's involvement in the current project probably contributed to Taron Egerton getting the job following their work together on last year's ""Kingsman"". And a great choice he is too. Almost unrecognizable from the sharp- suited Eggsy in ""Kingsman"" and gangster-sidekick Teddy in ""Legend"", Egerton switches effortlessly between clueless goofball and steely determined sportsman.The film's emotional heart though is with Hugh Jackman's side-story, battling with drink after throwing his own chance away with US-coach Warren Sharp (a nice cameo by Christopher Walken). Although going a little OTT at times (we see for example that he is no Meg Ryan!), Jackman provides a solid acting foundation that the rest of the cast can play off.Rounding out the cast are solid performances from Jo Hartley (""This is England"") as Eddie's Mum, Mark Benton (""Waterloo Road"") as a BOA official, Rune Temte as a bear of a Norwegian coach and the ever-warming Jim Broadbent as a BBC commentator.An 'attaboy' should also go to the special effects crew headed up by Marty McLaughlin for making believe a man can fly. Whilst ‚Äì you understand ‚Äì not in any way doubting Jackman's ability to risk his pretty face on a 90m jump, the nighttime sequence of him doing that jump is really nicely executed (with cinematography by George Richmond).A quick browse at Wikipedia will make it clear that there has been a lot of license taken with this as a ""true story"", and to be fair the prefix ""based on a.."" was used! And the film is not without irritations: Terry's negativity to his son's actions is about 25% overplayed in Simon Kelton's story, and the coach/prot√©g√© sub-plot has been overused in the past. The soundtrack (music) by Matthew Margeson is also rather grating particularly early on in the film: it is presumably going for 'period' in its use of Hammond organ cheesiness, but that music was tiresome in the 80's too! Fortunately Margeson redeems himself with some kick-ass (no pun intended) classic 80's tracks neatly edited into the action.These criticisms aside, I dare you to come out of this film without a silly grin on your face. I certainly did. Directed by Dexter Fletcher (""Sunshine on Leith"") it's not likely to win any Oscars, but in setting out to deliver what it said on the can it succeeded in all respects.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com to see the graphical version of this review.

Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief,2015,8.0,A documentary looking at the inner-workings of the Church of Scientology.,"There are a number of documentaries about this having accumulated since the 60s, but the phenomenon is that each new documentary reveals new more shocking facts about the business and its mentality than the previous ones, apparently because the material is still accumulating. There is very much important data from earlier documentaries missing here, many key persons are left out of the picture, which nevertheless is completed by the new ones appearing, corroborating all previous testimonies. It's a vitally important documentary, most of all because in the world society we are living in today so many, if not the majority of people, are not aware that it is an age of brainwash, and they still haven't learned to protect themselves against it. What you marvel at in this documentary, which many of the participants honestly do, is that they keep swallowing the racket for years before they can bring themselves to accept that they have been swindled, in most cases of their lives, which they don't realize until their lives are lost or completely devastated. In an effort to concentrate on the good things in Scientology I wrote an article some years back where I posed the open question - what went wrong? Apparently everything went wrong from the beginning, the founder having no self-criticism and no objective distance to what he was doing, but simply himself first of all falling a victim to the delusions of his own science fiction fantasies. Of course, there must be something good in Scientology, there must be a corn of truth in it somewhere, but whatever once was good and even of some worthwhile philosophical common sense and rational wisdom was flooded by the bolting derailing vicious circle of greed fueled by unrestricted paranoia, the constant validation of which seems to be the very substance and force of the organization."
Sicario,2015,7.7,An idealistic FBI agent is enlisted by a government task force to aid in the escalating war against drugs at the border area between the U.S. and Mexico.,"Reviewers say 'Sicario' is a gripping thriller exploring drug cartels with standout performances by Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin. Praised for Roger Deakins' atmospheric cinematography and Denis Villeneuve's direction, it delves into moral ambiguity and justice. Themes of ethical compromises and the human cost of the drug war are central. The score by J√≥hann J√≥hannsson enhances tension. However, some find Emily Blunt's character less impactful and criticize narrative and character development. Overall, it's visually stunning and thought-provoking, though not without flaws."
True Grit,2010,7.6,A stubborn teenager enlists the help of a tough U.S. Marshal to track down her father's murderer.,"I wasn't sure how to take the news that the Coen brothers were remaking the John Wayne film True Grit and I remained unsure even when it was clear that they were not so much remaking the film as making a different version of the original book. How would their humour and oddity sit in this story, how would their normal arch cynicism and cleverness work here? Well in reality it doesn't really come into play because they have made a film that is surprisingly free of that side of their work while also containing just enough in terms of characters and dialogue to make it their own. Mostly though what True Grit does is deliver an enjoyable story in an engaging and satisfying manner.While I don't agree with IMDb observer-in-chief tedg's overall rating for the film, he is correct when he says that the western as a genre has really been thoroughly explored and it is hard to bring freshness to such a film. The Cohen's struggle with this a little bit because it doesn't feel like ""their take"" on a genre so much as it does just feel like a western full stop. This perhaps limits them in terms of their own style but it does mean that they are focused on the telling of the story rather than anything else they may have added for colour. The end result of this is that the film is actually a really solidly told story that perhaps doesn't soar or have flamboyance or colourful touches but it does still engage as a tale. The story will be known to those familiar with the Wayne film but the slant very much onto Mattie makes it feel like a different story, albeit with much familiar about it. It is well told though and I found myself engaged by it just as much as I was never really thrilled by it. It has heart in its main character, it has a forward motion and it has a nice touch of humour throughout.The key to it is the performance from Steinfeld. She may well have been put forward for Supporting Actress in a political move by the studio but she is the heart and soul of this film. Her performance makes her Mattie a stubborn youth but one with juts enough vulnerability about her to suggest some of it is a front to cover herself in this regard. While she never struck me as a person that would exist within this story, she did convince me as a character and she was a delight to watch ‚Äì this is her story and she makes it such. This puts Bridges in the supporting role and he is great there, having fun with the role and adding colour to things. Damon underplays wisely ‚Äì sparking nicely off Bridges but letting these two having the light. Brolin, Pepper and others all deliver solid turns without stealing anything. Perhaps aware of what the genre is best known for (the landscapes) Deakins is restrained; where he made art with Jesse James, here he focuses on the smaller moments ‚Äì the light from a campfire, the falling of snow ‚Äì and he captures them excellently. At some point he will win his Oscar ‚Äì maybe this is it but certainly his body of work cries out for it.True Grit is not quite the brilliant piece of work that the ""for your consideration"" campaign would have you believe but it is a great piece of storytelling. The Coen brothers deliver some fine dialogue and colour but leave the telling free of cynicism or snideness (not a word, but you know what I mean). The story engaged me and is only made better by the strong pair of performances in the lead ‚Äì but particularly Steinfeld, who makes this film in the same way that Portman made Black Swan this year."
The Hudsucker Proxy,1994,7.2,A naive business graduate is installed as president of a manufacturing company as part of a stock scam.,"I cannot understand why this movie has not earned the respect it deserves. Norville Barnes represents high hopes and bright ideas, and when he starts out his intentions are pure.  But when money makes him lose his focus, only love can put him back on the right track.  Tim Robbins and Jennifer Jason Leigh are masterful in this movie, which is one of my personal favorites."
Deadpool,2016,8.0,"A wisecracking mercenary gets experimented on and becomes immortal yet hideously scarred, and sets out to track down the man who ruined his looks.","In the film, Wade Wilson hunts the man who gave him mutant abilities and a scarred physical appearance, becoming the beloved antihero. Deadpool is a smart, fun and innovative superhero movie. It's wildly entertaining, violent , has stylish action sequences and the characters are well developed. Deadpool delivers a large dose of fun and it perfectly mixes elements of humor and over-the-top action.Rating: 8,3."
The Avengers,1998,3.8,Two British Agents team up to stop Sir August de Wynter from destroying the world with a weather-changing machine.,"I wasn't all that interested in watching this movie, but I decided to anyway since it was one of the only ones that week there that I hadn't seen yet. I should've saw one of the others. I don't even remember what they are now, but it doesn't matter. I am pretty sure that THE AVENGERS is the worst movie of the decade and one of my least favorite movies of all time.John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) team up to stop Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) from destroying the planet with a weather-changing machine. I won't go into the plot too deeply, because it's just plain stupid.The acting in this movie was not very good. Ralph Fiennes and Fiona Shaw (Father) play two of the most annoying characters in any movies that I have ever seen. The constant unwitty one-liners between Fiennes and Thurman is very annoying. Sean Connery is at his worst here. I was disappointed in him, because he is a great actor who doesn't belong in this movie. Sir August de Wynter? Just the name of the character alone should tell you much.There was, however, one thing that was good about this movie. That would be Uma Thurman in her tight leather. I am absolutely in love with Uma Thurman, and I don't think she belonged in this film, but I am pretty sure seeing her wearing those catsuits were the only thing that kept me from having to eat my own legs and drink my own urine to survive this movie.Maybe you'll think I'm exaggerating a bit, but I found this movie to be boring and annoying. I recommend that it be avoided at all costs."
Black Mass,2015,6.8,"The true story of Whitey Bulger, the brother of a state senator and the most infamous violent criminal in the history of South Boston, who became an FBI informant to take down a Mafia family invading his turf.","Black Mass (2015)*** (out of 4)Violent telling of Boston criminal James 'Whitey' Bulger (Johnny Depp) who started as just a small crook but quickly rose to be one of the biggest crime lords out there. A lot of this was due to his childhood friend John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), a FBI agent, who began working with the criminal in exchange for information.BLACK MASS really wasn't as great as I was hoping it would be but there's no question that it's a solid film that managed to features some very good performances. I think the film falls short of being great for a number of reasons but one of the biggest is the fact that we've seen this type of gangster film countless times before and there's really nothing here that separates this film from various others out there.I will say that the best thing about the film was the performance from Depp who really sinks his teeth into this role. Depp had been criticized for some of his film choices over the past few years but this is certainly him jumping back into the game and showing what he can do. I thought he was extremely good here and especially with that coldness he brought the character. He's surrounding by some nice support from Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon, Peter Sarsgaard, Rory Cochrane and Dakota Johnson.The gangster genre has delivered some of the greatest movies ever made and it's created some rather by-the-number films that were quickly forgotten. I wouldn't say this film is going to be forgotten but it's certainly not going to reach the levels of GOODFELLAS, THE GODFATHER or WHITE HEAT. With that said, there's a nice little story here, some great performances and some graphic violence that makes it worth watching."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,2014,5.8,"When a kingpin threatens New York City, a group of mutated turtle warriors must emerge from the shadows to protect their home.","I'm not even quite sure where to begin with this movie. I mean, I had decent hopes for it. Leading up to it, so many people seemed to be taking it way to seriously. I mean, come on. Its about giant talking turtles who fight crime. Its not supposed to be that serious. Hoo, boy.I guess I'll just start by saying this (spoilers ahead), the changes they made to the origin story don't make any goddamn sense, both in terms of simple logic and quality narrative structure. They completely removed any connection between Splinter and the Shredder, so say goodbye to any emotional connection or tension that that would have brought. And this version Splinter wasn't the ninja master, Hamato Yoshi or even a pet/student of Yoshi. In fact, Yoshi seems to have been omitted completely. So, how does Splinter become a ninja master himself? He reads a book. I'm not even joking. After both he and the turtles mutate he finds a book and teaches himself. And it wasn't even at the very beginning. I mean when Splinter begin teaching himself, the turtles are already walking and talking. He not only learned all of ninjitsu but also somehow mastered it, without any instruction or sparring, in less than ten years? AND he taught it to the turtles? BULLSHIT.The turtles themselves are one of the few not-terrible parts of the movie. All of there individual personalities are right where they should be but we are also kind of short-changed on the amount of interaction they have with each other. A bunch of brothers together, getting up to shenanigans? What a great, natural way to have conflict! But no, the movie follows April way too much.All of that is indicative of a larger problem with the writing. Both of the villains are BORING. The pacing is uneven and a lot of the dialogue is forced and ham-handed, Michelangelo was the worse in that respect. And believe me, I get it. Mikey is the loud mouth, party turtle. But is is possible (kind of necessary) that if a main character is annoying, to also be likable. Yes, it possible. Severus Snape. Perry Cox. Deadpool. These are all characters that are bad or annoying people but still likable as characters. After a few minutes of listening to Michelangelo, I just wanted him to shut the hell up.It doesn't get any better with the villains. I don't remember the last time I watched a movie with such boring villains. Instead of just sticking with one main villain, the Shredder, we now have two...for some reason. WE have Eric Sachs, who is a rich scientist/industrialist and the Shredder, an evil ninja master with no personality. Eric Sachs is working for the Shredder for money? But isn't he already like a billionaire with a castle on a mountain and his own skyscraper?Doe he need more money? What the hell for? Shredder is the most shallow and one-dimensional out of this whole damn movie. We're not really told anything of his back story or shown any of his motivation for anything. The foot clan is also no longer a group of ninja warriors, they're...guys with guns. Completely useless guys with guns (that'll be relevant later).They also unnecessarily tie April, Sachs and April's dad into the turtles' back story...for some reason. We don't even really meet April's father. And April is the one who saved them from the lab fire that killed her father...or wait, was it Eric who killed her father? The movie seems to confused on that point. And instead of keeping the baby turtles (like any little girl who likes animals would do) she...dumps them in the sewer? What the hell? The who thing is convoluted and doesn't make any damn sense.April O'Neil is uninteresting and stupid. Seriously, I mean she is unintelligent. She is supposedly an educated journalist but spends so much time trying to convince he boss of a ""story"" of talking, crime- fighting turtles without one single goddamn lick of evidence. Vernon Fenway is apparently supposed to be the comic relief but none of his jokes are funny and his sole role in the film seems to be driving April around. And why the hell is Whoopi Goldberg in this? She had like six lines. Why is she here?The camera-work was clich√©d and chaotic. There were times when the camera was moving around too much for you to easily follow the action. There is also a serious lack of cool martial arts fights for a NINJA Turtles movie, which is not surprising when you turn their main antagonists from ninja into guys with guns. I also couldn't even begin to take the Shredder serious in the action scenes. Are those giant swiss army knives on his hands? What the hell?Finally, the one thing, in my opinion, that sort of breaks the movie the most is that they made the turtles too damn powerful. Yes, the turtles are kind of superheroes. But wasn't being a bunch of kick-ass ninjas enough? No? You gotta give them super strength too? AND MAKE THEM BULLET PROOF!? Remember the previously said bit about the foot being a bunch of guys with guns? Yeah...you might see where I am going with this. It was bad enough to see the turtles throwing cars around and shattering concrete with punches. On some level, the audience needs to believe on some sort of fundamental level that the heroes are danger, that the threats that they face have meaning. Without that, there is no tension, no real conflict and with that...no excitement. No story.This movie nuked the fridge."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,2003,5.8,"In an alternate Victorian Age world, a group of famous contemporary fantasy, science fiction, and adventure characters team up on a secret mission.","I was very pleased with this movie. There are some who have claimed that those who enjoy this film have a low IQ. I see no reason why a person can't have a high IQ and enjoy an imaginative and fun film. For years I have enjoyed the works of Doyle, Wilde, Stevenson, Stoker, Twain, Haggard, Wells, Poe, and Verne. I went into this film hoping it would do their characters justice. It did. Some prefer the ""original"" versions of these characters by Alan Moore. I prefer the way they were written by their creators. The characters are closer to their literary selves in the film version than in the comic book. I was very happy about that. I grew up with these characters and they played a huge part in my childhood fantasy life. Other girls may have pretended to be Wonder Woman, but I was Captain Nemo! I was hoping that LXG captured the imaginative world that flourished in my young mind when I read all those old beloved books. LXG delivered! This is a fun escapist fantasy and all of my favorite literary characters are in great form. I had a truly wonderful time watching LXG. It's a fun adventure that requires that you bring your inner child along for the ride. My inner child loved it. I loved it too!"
On the Road,2012,6.0,"Young writer Sal Paradise has his life shaken by the arrival of free-spirited Dean Moriarty and his girl, Marylou. As they travel across the country, they encounter a mix of people who each impact their journey indelibly.","I will try to be as short as I can be in my review, but I am just very surprised about the very positive reviews on IMDb. For me this was another huge disappointment. yes there are great landscapes, the photography is nice and the actors surely are OK, the music is often inspiring, but even if the movie basically tells the same events as in the book, I found it pretty boring, and above all the spirit of the book, about freedom etc, was completely gone. Too many scenes are just taken inside hotels rooms, houses etc, isn't this movie entitled on the road? Again, regarding the spirit of freedom, in the book surely wasn't all about sex and multiple partners etc, because that's not at all the freedom Jack Kerouac was talking about when he wrote it, these components have been way too much highlighted. I am sorry but I left the cinema pretty disappointed, if we had to wait all these year for a version of the book, and this is the result, well it would have been better to only have the book."
My Big Fat Greek Wedding,2002,6.6,A young Greek woman falls in love with a non-Greek and struggles to get her family to accept him while she comes to terms with her heritage and cultural identity.,"i usually hate dissing the other reviewers on these things because everyone is entitled to their opinions, but, even though they usually frustrate me, i always read the reviews to gauge how a movie affects the mainstream public, as i think that's usually the most important thing to be considered.i just finished commenting on 'the rules of attraction', and it surprised me to see how there were more positive comments about that film than this one. it also surprised me to see that most of the negative reviews of this film talked about how they were 'bored' by this movie, or how nia vardalos is 'ugly', or how this film is only for 'women' or 'old people'.granted, this movie has very little sex, violence, or MTV editing, but it does what most movies try to do and fail at doing; creates an engaging story with interesting characters.  however, it's sad to see that this quality apparently doesn't carry much currency anymore, and that people can't deal with humor that's not shoved in their face or isn't right there on the surface.the ironic thing about this is that MBFGW isn't even that innovative or unique.  it takes the normal three act romantic comedy structure and, well, dehollywoodizes it a little bit.  yeah, the main characters aren't typical hollywood hot. (well, john corbett is...) but you probably aren't either. and all these people commenting on how it's 'racist' or 'stereotyped'... nia vardalos, the writer, IS GREEK!  this film is adapted from her one woman show!  it's interesting that 'ethnic' films have to take on, what, a documentary form or something to seem authentic?  if anything is racist, that is.it's super that 11,000 people have voted on this film and that it grossed so much $$.  even though, when it comes down to it, this is just a ""better"" romantic comedy which stays in the box for much of the time, it IS, indeed, better than most movie fare out there and its popularity gives me hope that the ""boring"" movies with ""ugly"" people may have a chance with the jaded tards of middle america."
The Master,2012,7.1,A Naval veteran arrives home from war unsettled and uncertain of his future - until he is tantalized by a cult and its charismatic leader.,"I had no clue what I was heading into when I pressed play. I think it's really hard to make a bad movie when you have Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jaoquin Phoenix, Amy Adams, and Jesse Plemons leading the charge. Hoffman and Phoenix are fully absorbed into their characters and the film forces its audience to try and follow these conversations that somehow feel super grounded (due to Hoffman's amazing delivery) and unsettling at the same time. This movie really could not have worked without the talent of these actors.Amy Adams does so much with so little screen time; I do wish we got more time with her but I think her lack of presence contributes to the messaging of the film. She gives an extremely pulled back/subtle performance of a woman that is truly in the middle of the storm.This feels fresh and distinct from any other movie I've watched, so I'd definitely recommend it."
De Hobbit: De Slag van Vijf Legers,2014,7.4,Bilbo Baggins and company are forced to engage in a war against an array of combatants and keep the Lonely Mountain from falling into the hands of a rising darkness.,"I was distinctly underwhelmed by the first two Hobbit movies, I thought they were good but just that ""Good"". They live in the shadow of the Lord Of The Rings movies and simply paled in comparison and so going into The Battle Of The Five Armies I expected more of the same.According to both IMDb and the profit margin this was the most poorly received of the franchise, clearly people did not like the film by comparison. But as usual, I have to be different.I consider this to not only be the best of the Hobbit franchise but also hot on the heels in quality as the LOTR trilogy.The story culminates beautifully and if you can get past the many changes that were made you'll see the finale of a wondrous tale and a battle on screen that blew me away.Once again the fantastic cast, stunning score, mind blowing effects and sheer beauty envelope you into the world of Middle Earth and I was gripped.Yes its not flawless, but it is pretty damn close.The Good:Amazing openingAction scenes are brutalJames NesbittEvangeline LillyThe Bad:Still a lot of changesOne death was poorly done."
Happiness,1998,7.7,"The lives of several individuals intertwine as they go about their lives in their own unique ways, engaging in acts which society as a whole might find disturbing in a desperate search for human connection.","This is the best movie I never, ever want to see again. It's dark, disgusting, powerful, painful and honest. The focal point of cinema has been used here as an assault on every day life. Everyone has had these moments at one point or another in their lives and now here's the hot-faced shame and moral nausea experienced vicariously through a parade of terrible, terrible people, not parsed out by blessed months or years between horrifying events as one would hopefully find in real life, but non-stop for however many minutes this film lasts. I can't deny that it was a good film, but it's also a film that hurts to watch. Good job in an era when the only thing I can remotely equate this experience to is being in the front row at ""Cloverfield"" and being surrounded by people vomiting."
The Danish Girl,2015,7.1,A love story loosely inspired by the lives of Danish artists Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener. Lili and Gerda's marriage and work evolve as they navigate Lili's groundbreaking journey as a transgender pioneer.,"The Danish Girl (2015)*** (out of 4)The semi true-story of painters Einar (Eddie Redmayne) and Gerda Wegener (Alicia Vikander), a married couple who find their lives changing when Einar dresses as a woman so Gerda can have someone to paint but it brings something out in him. Soon Einar is going around as the Lili character and soon decides that he's a woman on the inside.THE DANISH GIRL is another beautiful looking film from Tom Hooper, the director best known for his Oscar-winner THE KING'S SPEECH. Like that film the director has no problem with the visual look of the film and Hooper certainly knows how to put you in the period setting. It also doesn't hurt that we've got some excellent performances and a rather interesting and conflicted love story.I think the real draw here are the performances with Redmayne once again delivering a remarkable piece of work just a year after his Oscar win for THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING. A lot of actors have played male/female characters to perfection. In my mind the greatest was Dustin Hoffman in TOOTSIE but that there was a comedy whereas this here certainly isn't. It was really remarkable seeing how well Redmayne played both the male and female character and he was certainly believable as both. Whenever the Lili character was on screen you really did feel as if you were watching an actress and not just a man playing a female. Vikander is also excellent as the woman who finds the man she love slowly turning into someone else.The film features some beautiful cinematography, a great music score and I also thought the screenplay was very good. The story itself drags a tad bit during the first portion but I think it asks a lot of really good questions about what love is and of course what one feels about who they really are. I thought the flow of the film was quite good and there's no question that it nails the costume design and sets. THE DANISH GIRL isn't a masterpiece but it's certainly a very good movie with some excellent performances."
Nightcrawler,2014,7.8,A petty thief desperate for work muscles into the world of crime journalism and becomes the star of his own story as he blurs the line between observer and participant.,"I'd like to emphasize one thing that gets me with every movie this guy is in. The acting. Jake Gyllenhaal's acting never fails to impress me. He had the crazy eyes in this movie, and to be honest, it made me look away a few times. Very eerie addition to the character, love this guy. His demeanor reminded me of his role in The Guilty. The movie itself was pretty good. I hate an open ending, but I think it fits well with the theme and meaning of the actual film. It leaves u to interpret the ending and its connection to the real world. Overall, I recommend, especially if u love a mentally unstable and uncanny Gyllenhaal role."
Spotlight,2015,8.1,"The true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core.","Reviewers say 'Spotlight' is acclaimed for its powerful true story, strong performances, and meticulous portrayal of investigative journalism. The film, detailing the Boston Globe's probe into the Catholic Church's child abuse scandal, is praised for its compelling narrative, excellent script, and ensemble cast. Critics appreciate its restraint, authenticity, and emotional impact. Some note the slow pace and lack of Hollywood elements, valuing its focus on the investigative process and journalism's importance. A few find characters underdeveloped and the film somewhat formulaic, but overall, 'Spotlight' is regarded as significant and impactful."
The Shallows,2016,6.3,"A mere 200 yards from shore, surfer Nancy is attacked by a great white shark, with her short journey to safety becoming the ultimate contest of wills.","Steven Spielberg has a lot to answer for. Ever since he made Jaws in 1975 there have been countless attempts on the big screen to emulate that film and all have failed. Some have been excruciatingly bad but thankfully The Shallows isn't one of those. This is the story of Nancy who travels to a secluded beach to surf . While in the water , she is hunted by a great white shark and finds herself stranded on a rock with the tide going out . Wounded and with time running out she battles to get away from the shark. Probably the best thing about this film is performance of Blake Lively. She definitely carries this film. The action is pretty good although totally predictable and it looks great up until the use of CGI underwater when it starts to look like a scene from a Sharks Tale. At a pleasant running time of 84 minutes , The Shallows is good bit of escapism but like every other shark film , it's no Jaws."
The Eichmann Show,,6.5,"Dramatisation of the team hoping to televise the trial of Adolf Eichmann, an infamous Nazi responsible for the deaths of millions of Jews. It focuses on Leo Hurwitz, a documentary film-maker and Milton Fruchtman, a producer.","The Eichmann Show is a documentary drama about the televising of Adolf Eichmann's 1961 trial in Israel after he was captured in Argentina. Eichmann was regarded as one of the architect's of the final reckoning which led to the deaths of countless Jews and others.Anthony LaPaglia is the television director Leo Hurwitz and Martin Freeman is the producer Milton Fruchtman who set about televising what became known at the time as the 'trial of the century' as it was broadcast in 37 countries over four months. It was maybe the first time witnesses described the horrors of the concentration camp to a wider public. As the hotelier, Mrs Landau (Rebecca Front) informs her guest, many people simply could not believe such events had occurred during the second world war.Although Fruchtman had been given permission to film the trial by the authorities the Judges were uneasy as they felt the television cameras and the noise they made would be a distraction and they set about to hide the cameras or disguise them so they would be intrusive.The film inter-cuts the black and white real trial footage. The historic documentary footage of the victims of concentration camps is rather distressing. Eichmann is impassive throughout the trial as the footage is shown and witnesses testimony is given.Its a worthy piece but the drama was rather bland. Of course the historic footage is shocking and sickening, the dramatised parts in contrast failed to enthral me. I felt a better constructed documentary would had told the story better with the historical footage."
Nymphomaniac Part 1,2013,6.9,A self-diagnosed nymphomaniac recounts her erotic experiences to the man who saved her after a beating.,"Denmark's notorious infant terrible, who used despair and unflinching self-mutilation as his canvas in his last few films, had already sparked a great deal of controversy and intrigue when the title of his next venture was announced. Nymphomaniac would deal with the bare-it-all, spare-no-details chronicle of a woman's sexual awakening, adventuring, and ultimate degradation. Lars von Trier, who some have accused of misogyny and making movies purely to shock, caught a good bit of flak for daring to make a movie that can be considered a woman's sexual autobiography, and most expected it to be a truly explicit film that could be considered little more than pornography.Most people underestimate Lars von Trier. While he does have his peculiarities, he is first and foremost an artist. And Nymphomaniac, his third outing with his muse Charlotte Gainsbourg, is perhaps his most expansive work to date. Split into two films and covering several decades, von Trier has concocted a Homeric tale of sound and fury and all sorts of sexual depravity. But this film is not designed to arouse, to titillate. Far from it; the sex is clinical, detached, almost boring at times.As I said, this is a woman's odyssey. This woman is Joe (Gainsbourg), who is discovered beaten within an inch of her life in a back alley by a lonely bachelor named Seligman (Stellan Skarsgard). Joe demands Seligman not call for assistance, instead accompanying the man back to his apartment for a cup of tea. And after she gets patched up, Joe finds Seligman a willing listener, a father confessor of sorts, and begins to spin a tale of promiscuity that would drive most men wild but intrigues Seligman in a much more philosophical manner. Joe's story starts from her discovery of her own sexuality at the age of two, and by the time she came to barely legal age (here played by Stacy Martin) and how she begins exploring her hypersensual nature. She abandons her virginity by bedding a motorhead (a curiously accented Shia LaBeouf), then even playing games of one-upmanship with her best friend and fellow sex addict (one scene features the girls competing to see who can bang the most guys on a train to win a bag of chocolates). As Gainsbourg's present-day Joe explains herself, Seligman picks out details and compares her sexual deviancy to the most obscure things, from fishing lures to baroque tritones. Von Trier is a very distinct writer, always seeming to verge on the arcane in his observations on the human condition, and here he gives an interesting perversion on, well, perversion. Is Seligman a truly insightful man when it comes to the human condition, or is he just the most hopelessly awkward fool imaginable?While Gainsbourg brings a great deal of gravitas to the role, it is her most subdued of the three films she's done with von Trier. And yet it is her most accessible, and she narrates the events of the film with such matter-of-fact certainty, her throaty voice describing the life she's led with all of the care and calm of a woman describing the weather. But in the first half of the saga's four-hour run time, it is Stacy Martin who does the heavy lifting, and she does it with remarkable skill, carefully balancing between naivet√© and calculation. As Joe matures and sinks further into her addiction (a term she despises), more and more familiar faces start showing up. Her parents are briefly played by Christian Slater and Connie Nielsen, the former having an excellent ""money scene"" while the latter has maybe thirty seconds of screen time. Shia LaBeouf, who zigzags between admirable and awkward (sometimes in the course of the same scene), returns as Joe's first employer and ultimately her husband. And mention must be made of Uma Thurman's haughtily fiery scene-stealer of a performance that blazes on-screen as a jilted wife whose husband has abandoned her for what he expected to be a life with Joe. She follows her husband to Joe's apartment with their three tykes in tow, and in the span of seven minutes she frays and has a complete emotional meltdown.As the first half of the film segues in to the second, Gainsbourg takes the fore, as Joe stops seeking sexual release for joy and instead out of a desperate need to feel something. As the film goes on, she explores different fetishes and outlets, including but not limited to interracial threesomes, bondage, humiliation of all sorts. In one notable case, Gainsbourg's character submits herself to the whims of a young man who specializes in intense BDSM. The fact that this rather devious fellow is played by Jamie Bell is a bit of a shock to anyone who's seen Billy Elliot recently. But if anyone was stimulated by the first act of Joe's saga, the second act dashes it away with cold realism.As with all of von Trier's films, the ending is unforgettable. I confess that when I sensed the film drawing to a close, I was pleasantly surprised at how von Trier handled it, and that perhaps the Danish prince of melancholia had decided to serve up a happy ending for once. Of course, I forgot this is Lars von Trier we're talking about, and the final minute of the film may send audience members in a tizzy. It's part of the reason why I've taken so long to write my thoughts on it. But as I write this, I do think Nymphomaniac is a terrific entry in his canon, and a worthy closer to his trilogy."
San Andreas,2015,6.1,"In the aftermath of a massive earthquake in California, a rescue-chopper pilot makes a dangerous journey with his ex-wife across the state in order to rescue his daughter.","San Andreas (2015)*** (out of 4)After a massive earthquake strikes California, a father (Dwayne Johnson) must struggle to try and rescue his estranged wife (Carla Gugino) and his daughter (Alexandra Daddario) who finds herself somewhere in San Fransisco. While people are trying to dig themselves out of the damage, a seismologist (Paul Giamatti) warns people that the big one hasn't yet happened.SAN ANDREAS is without question one of the dumbest movies that you're going to see in the year 2015 or perhaps any other year. I mean, things happen here that are without question quite stupid and that includes a really dumb love story and the logic of some of the scenes are downright laughable. With that said, one really shouldn't go into this movie expecting anything other than a popcorn movie meant to keep you entertained and this film certainly does that as it's a pretty good throwback to the Irwin Allen disaster pictures like EARTHQUAKE, THE TOWERING INFERNO and THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE.I really can't believe I'm saying this but the special effects are certainly the highlight of the picture. I'm usually not a fan of CGI because more times than not it just looks fake and takes away from the story but we're reaching a point in technology where it's really hard to see the effect, which is just great. There's a massive amount of destruction throughout this film and I must admit that the effects make you feel that everything you're watching is real. This includes the actual earthquake footage as well as all the destruction around the state. There are countless buildings that fall and the aftermath of the quake looks extremely realistic.The story itself is quite stupid as we get all sorts of predictable scenes but I can't really blame the film for this as the entire disaster genre had silly melodrama going on. The relationship issues between Johnson and Gugino are quite stupid and of course there's a side story dealing with him not being able to save a daughter that died. The screenplay pretty much throws everything into the mix and just hopes any of it sticks. Again, it's hard to bash the ""dumb"" story too much since the film is so entertaining but I will give the film credit for delivering the highest body count in the history of cinema.Again, going into SAN ANDREAS expecting anything other than entertainment probably isn't the best idea. The actors are all entertaining in their own right and that's especially true for Daddario. As far as Johnson goes, he's certainly not the greatest actor in the world but he makes for a great action star."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,2015,6.6,Katniss and a team of rebels from District 13 prepare for the final battle that will decide the fate of Panem.,"Reluctant symbol of the revolution, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) leads a small group of freedom fighters into Panem to try and assassinate the wicked President Snow (Donald Sutherland).When they split Mockingjay into 2 parts, presumably for no other reason than financial gain, there was always the concern that the story would be far too drawn out (as with The Hobbit). And despite several decent action scenes (including booby-trap pods, a tidal wave of tar, and a mutt attack) that's precisely what has happened: at a whopping 137 minutes, this last film in the series feels like the proverbial dead horse has been well and truly flogged.I watched purely for the sake of completion, but at no point did I feel involved in the story or engaged with the characters. I just sat there waiting for the whole thing to end so I could move on to something else. A shame, because if they had taken the good bits from both Mockingjay movies and combined them into one (slightly longer) film, it might have been the best of the series and a fitting final√© for Katniss and co."
Fifty Shades of Grey (Extended Version),2015,4.2,"Literature student Anastasia Steele's life changes forever when she meets handsome, yet tormented, billionaire Christian Grey.","Reviewers say 'Fifty Shades of Grey' is divisive, with opinions varying widely. Criticisms include lack of depth, poor dialogue, and weak character development. However, some praise the cinematography, soundtrack, and performances by Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan. The film's portrayal of BDSM and handling of consent sparks significant discussion. Its impact on viewers' perceptions of BDSM relationships is notable. Overall, reactions are strong, with both negative and positive feedback."
Kaze no tani no Naushika,1984,8.0,Warrior and pacifist Princess Nausica√§ desperately struggles to prevent two warring nations from destroying themselves and their dying planet.,"Brilliant, captivating, and sometimes just plain awesome are some of things that come to mind while watching yet another one of Miyazaki's epic tales: Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Winds. Deliberately slow-moving at points, yet undeniably exciting in and out of it's action sequences, and a fantastic introduction to anime itself.Without revealing too much of the plot, it takes us through the life of Nausicaa, a princess of a small village, and her struggles to stop warring nations from destroying an important source that can save the planet. The planet has already gone through a major destruction that nearly wiped out humanity, and their are large insects called ohmu, that guard the source that is spreading through the world.Miyazaki introduces an empowerment of female characters in his animes, such as Princess Mononoke, Kiki's Delivery Service, and his most recent, Howl's Moving Castle (Hauru no ugoku shiro). The characters are done with style and care, and, in Nausicaa, there is no exception.It amazes me that this film created some controversy when released, being banned in Poland because of it's depiction of an ecological disaster. Though the movie is obviously fantasy, it turns out that some may consider it a touchy subject. I didn't find any offense whatsoever with anything the movie showed, just a futuristic disaster no doubt caused by man.Combining fantasy and science-fiction, Nausicaa is nice to look at. It certainly shows it's age when compared to some newer animes, not having the help from high-end computers. Considering it was done in the 80's, Miyazaki's production team did a great job. Little details, backgrounds, gadgets, & animals are drawn slightly better then some Japanese animes from that time.Keep in mind that my review is based on the Disney release (Feb 2005). It's cleaned up, unedited, with new voices from well known actors that sound great (but I still prefer subtitles). Keep far away from the old version 'Warriors of the Wind', which chops off more then half-hour from the movie.9 out of 10"
Nymphomaniac: Vol. II,2013,6.6,"The continuation of Joe's sexually dictated life delves into the darker aspects of her adulthood, obsessions and what led to her being in Seligman's care.","Lars von Trier's second film about the life story of a female nymphomaniac goes down increasingly dark alleyways compared to VOL. I, but at the same time I found it the lesser movie. This film just doesn't have the drive or vitality that made the first film so interesting, and there are some odd plot decisions - especially towards the climax - that don't ring true.There are still some oddly gripping moments here, but they're more disturbing than ever. Jamie Bell is a real surprise, playing a completely different character to that than you'd expect and doing very well with it too. I'm surprised that I found Charlotte Gainsbourg less sympathetic than the actress playing the younger version of her character. By the time Willem Dafoe enters the frame, the movie seems to have lost its way and become a bizarre, slow-paced thriller instead. And don't get me started on the Mia Goth stuff.As before, this is a beautifully shot movie with a lot of fragility and artiness contained within its shots. But Lars von Trier can only keep the audience's interest for so long, and by now his tale is beginning to drag, leaving a film that is only so-so rather than profound. And that 'twist' ending is ludicrous more than anything else."
Minions,2015,6.4,"Minions Stuart, Kevin, and Bob are recruited by Scarlet Overkill, a supervillain who, alongside her inventor husband Herb, hatches a plot to take over the world.","Quickie Review:Minions from the dawn of time have always searched to serve the most despicable masters in the world. After failing to keep their masters numerous times, the minions feel without purpose. That's when three brave minions, Kevin, Bob, and Stuart set out on a journey to find their new master. Despicable Me franchise has done a lot of things right, one of which that clicked with all ages were the adorable little minions. This film could've been very basic, continuously rehashing a collection slapstick comedy, and just simply depend on the popularity of the minions. Instead, the creators of this film added heart to the characters, delivering a movie that kids will love and adults will have fun with.Full Review:As much as I love the minions in the Despicable Me movies, I was quite pessimistic on how good Minions was going to be. It just felt like a cash grab. Of course, all movies aim to grab some cash but this movie in particular felt like the studio was just capitalising on the popularity of the characters. Gratefully, the movie got me to set aside my pessimism.One of my biggest concerns was whether a collection of side characters can really carry an entire movie. Short answer as it turns out: yes they can. It works because we are focusing on just three minions for the majority of the movie. Each of them have their unique personality that shines through without a single word of comprehensible dialogue. That in itself is an amazing feat, the minion-gibberish is all non-sense and yet I am able to empathise with them. I can't even say the same for actual human actors in other movies sometimes! So in that sense, job well done animators. I also liked the small story arc that was given to the villain of the movie, Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock). She wasn't a villain just for the sake of it, which added another dimension to what could have been a generic character. There is relatable back story to her that made us understand where she was coming from, while still retaining the unpredictable evil-ness.The movie is not without flaws. There are times where the jokes might be too slapstick for adults to enjoy. These scenes are obviously aimed for the kids. They don't completely alienate us grown-ups but it is still noticeable. On top of that, I have to say I felt the absence of Gru and the kids from the Despicable Me movies. What I love about the minions is their relationship with Gru's family, the pranks, the shenanigans, the care they have for each other, is all so delightful to watch. This absence was bound to happen since we are concentrating on the minions. At the same time, aside from Scarlett Overkill there are no other memorable supporting characters.Even with the problems, I really did enjoy my time watching Minions. It was a great light hearted, charming, fun movie. If you have little kids, nephews or nieces, don't hesitate to take them to the cinema. They will have an awesome time. Together you too will find some amusing entertainment."
Sleeping with Other People,2015,6.5,"A good-natured womanizer and a serial cheater form a platonic relationship that helps reform them in ways, while a mutual attraction sets in.","I'm a little surprised at all the negative reviews here. It's hard to imagine what the reviewers found missing. Romance? Comedy? Or both? Because I found plenty of each. I will say that I can see how you need to be able to relate to the lifestyles depicted to appreciate the film. Because if you can't, this might as well be about life on Mars.This is a smart movie. And the concept is pretty original, considering the difficulty of deviating from the restrictions of the genre. The leads are immensely likable and each able to toss off complex comedic riffs with ease. And I very much enjoyed seeing Adam Scott play the heavy. Not easy to portray a dull-as-donuts bad guy, but he pulled it off.Despite the ""truthiness"" of the dialog, the movie does share one thing with all romantic comedies: it's a wet dream for the love hungry. Especially for those folks who juggle and struggle with the reality of modern relationships. The lead characters wear a veneer of cynical sophistication that many of us use as protective shields. But, as is expected from a rom-com, the veneer cracks. And we're glad when it does.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but be warned: it is a movie for grown ups."
Eyes Wide Shut,1999,7.5,"A Manhattan doctor embarks on a bizarre, night-long odyssey after his wife's admission of unfulfilled longing.","I managed to swallow my expectations before the film, setting myself to judge it on its own without judging it as a Kubrick film. No need, no need! This film IS a Kubrick film, without any doubt, and as all Kubrick films are it was absolutely stunning. Absolutely. Visually it is brilliant, though I should warn that this isn't quite as visual a film as most other Kubrick works. A lot of the film focuses on the characters, on human interaction, something rather new to this director. Of course, all the Kubrick trademarks are there, cold analytical gazes, sharp introspection. Tom Cruise seems like Jack Nicholson in 'The Shining' and even Malcolm MacDowell in 'A Clockwork Orange' at times, a rather striking fact considering that this is Tom Cruise. The performances were excellent all around, even from places not expected. Again, this is typical for Kubrick. He wasn't much of a people director, but he still knew how to direct people.Almost every moment of this film was flawless, perfect and pristine. The dialog is predictable, but in some solemn and holy fateful sort of way, as though the words and the moments are matched so essentially that nothing else could possibly fit. Beyond that the sounds and images all fit together beautifully, creating an almost unblemished whole. The only part that didn't seem right was the sequence that had been digitally altered. While the alterations were not nearly so obtrusive as I had feared (not knowing about them one probably wouldn't notice them) they do grow a bit noticeable for redundancy (you see a lot more backs than you'd expect, and always in the same places). Unfortunately these came right in the middle of one of the most visually amazing pieces of the film (one of the most amazing pieces of cinema as a whole, in my opinion), a very unwelcome distraction.Is this movie about sex? Yes, it is, but more importantly it is about people. The sex part is simply a product thereof. This is one of the most disturbingly honest portraits of human behavior and motivations ever made. The most honest I've ever seen, at least. To be put simply: It is about sex because people are about sex.I'm still trying to sort through this movie. It's been a good twelve hours since I saw it, and I can still feel it, hard and definite, rotating in my stomach. The film itself seems mostly void of opinion (not entirely, but mostly), serving more as a general statement and commentary than any specific moral warning, but the questions it inspires are very strong indeed. The film, being objective, provides no answers, no justification for humanity. There is no redemption, either, none whatsoever. The film's final word sums it (it being the film and humanity) up pretty well, for better or for worse. I guess that depends on you.A common thread in Kubrick's films since 2001 has been the contemplation and examination of human intentions, the essence of human behavior. Motivations. He's shown us violence and madness and everything else, all tracking the path back to the dawn of man. I think he finally figured it out with this film, however anticlimactic the discovery might have been. At least he did finally figure it out. That's something.I am one of many. I never had the privilege to know Stanley Kubrick. I don't even know that privilege is the right word. I do know his films, though, and while I am in no position to say that I will miss him as a person, I can say, without doubt or hesitation, that I will miss him as a filmmaker."
Man Up,2015,6.8,A single woman takes the place of a stranger's blind date and finds the perfect man for her.,"Man Up is a British romantic comedy about a man and a woman who meets on a blind date. Simon Pegg plays Jack, a 40 year old divorced man who has planned a blind date with a 24 year old girl. Lake Bell plays the 34 year old Nancy who is taking the train home to her parents wedding anniversary. Nancy accidentally meet Jack's blind date and switch places with her when she discovers that the girl forgot her book, the one thing she needed to bring to the date. Jack is totally unaware of the switch and immediately takes Nancy, the wrong girl, out on the streets of London.Man Up is definitely among the best romantic comedies I've seen in a long time. With a farce like humor and a perfect timing in editing and story, the film rushes away with the speed of a car chase. Nancy is at first forced to lie to Jack so that he doesn't suspect anything and he also deliberately hides his past to avoid looking foolish. After a while as the film goes on they both discover that they are very alike. Willingly and unwillingly they expose their best and worst sides of themselves for each other. It becomes some sort of race between them, a race impossible to win.We are thrown out into London's night life with bowling, bars and portable restaurants. In some way the director is able to catch the characters' many sides in a very short time. At the same time every location they visit, plays a big part for the whole picture. They both encounter people from their past, each one affecting their date positively and negatively. Do not miss the very funny London taxi vs bike race between them. It is a very quick and incredibly refreshing romantic comedy after a couple of years with pretty lame and mediocre films in the same genre. I almost thought that the romcom film had died out, but here we actually get proof that it still works. Come on, more films like this."
WALL-E,2008,8.4,"A robot who is responsible for cleaning a waste-covered Earth meets another robot and falls in love with her. Together, they set out on a journey that will alter the fate of mankind.","Reviewers say 'WALL-E' is acclaimed for its innovative animation, compelling robot love story, and strong environmental message. The film delves into consumerism, environmentalism, and technology's impact on humanity. Critics praise its emotional depth, visual brilliance, and thought-provoking narrative. Some note minor issues with pacing and thematic execution, yet 'WALL-E' is celebrated as a landmark in animation and a timeless cinematic experience."

Fantastic Four,2015,4.3,Four young outsiders teleport to an alternate and dangerous universe which alters their physical form in shocking ways. The four must learn to harness their new abilities and work together to save Earth from a former friend turned enemy.,"Reviewers say 'Fantastic Four' received mixed reviews, highlighting its darker tone, character development, and fresh approach. Performances, especially by Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan, were praised. However, the film faced criticism for its pacing, lack of action, and underdeveloped characters. Dr. Doom's portrayal and CGI effects were contentious. Some felt it missed the Fantastic Four's charm and family dynamic. Despite positive elements, the overall reception was disappointing, marking it as one of the weaker superhero films."
Argo 2,2015,6.7,"Hungarian small time crook, 70 year old Tibi Balog gets out of prison after 10 years, but he didn't change a bit.

As expected, Tibi completely screws up the job and becomes the target of ...Read all","During the first 5 minutes we thought that we sat in for the wrong movie at the cinema: it was perfectly done, Hollywood style of the newest action feature.After this intro one gets to a new level of the vulgar, exaggerated Eastern European humour one expects to see after having seen the first part (the second part is understandable without watching the first but I believe it gets better with watching both parts).If you haven't been to Eastern Europe or I might risk even you haven't spent a long time in this region of the world chances are that you won't appreciate the jokes. Jokes are funny if they relate to reality and me and my friends: we laughed out loud at least half the time...Great to see that in a short time after Liza the fox fairy (Liza, a r√≥kat√ºnd√©r) there's another Hungarian movie that brings in a new, far away culture (this time Japan) unexpectedly to this action-comedy.If you do know whether to watch it now or no: give it a try, watch the first 5 minutes, you'll love it and then in the next 15-20 you'll get the flavour of the kind of humour of the movie.If you liked the first part probably you'll love this one: at least this is how it went with me. Enjoy!"
Hotel Transylvania 2,2015,6.6,"Dracula and his friends try to bring out the monster in his half human, half vampire grandson in order to keep Mavis from leaving the hotel.","2012's Hotel Transylvania was kind of a surprise. Though it's still riddled with pop cultural references, but its flavor wondrously resembles to the director's cartoon shows in the 90's which brings visual and comedic nostalgia, in the CG animated form (or it's basically just acknowledging us that this type of animation still exists.) Revisiting the same gang with the same people behind it can be welcoming, maybe a little worrisome when it comes to plotting. The prediction can be somewhat true; the craziness and heart remains, but the narrative is too busy, even without much development, even compared to its predecessor. What exceeds the expectation is the theme it handles is a lot interesting. Overall, it brought enough nuttiness for the fans and brought enough sweetness to everyone else.While the first one was about overcoming the monster's misanthropy, Hotel Transylvania 2 is about trying to accept humans, even though Drac haven't fully let go of his old nature. And the setup starts from Dracula's daughter, Mavis, marrying a human, Jonathan, then transitioned to them having a baby. And the main conflict here is their son not inheriting the vampire gene may lead the couple to live in a normal human town. And just like what the trailer shows, the movie mostly runs with Dracula pushing his grandson to become a vampire, assuming that he may just be a late bloomer. And these scenes don't exactly make a clever narrative, they are basically just one gag to another, while we occasionally see the kid's parents trying to fit in the human world. In spite of still being entertaining and funny, the plot doesn't seem to actually move forward. It's like it's just playing around until it decides to proceed or something. But at times, it's sort of hinting something more heartfelt; like how Mavis feels like she is being somewhat patronized in the human world or how young Dennis is getting tired with Dracula's demands. And it's surprisingly more engaging to watch, even though the gags are already pretty fun.It doesn't go deep, obviously, but it makes up a lot after an almost extravagant extent of punchlines. The animation is still crazy looking which brings distinct appeal within their unhinged facial expressions, energetic movements and freely constructed action. Even for jokes where the punchline is just being awkward (for no particular reason,) it sort of perfectly fits with this type of visual. The humor is best when it is spoken by the animation. The voice acting is still delightful, with Adam Sandler still bringing the heart in Dracula. The rest just gave these already lively animated characters more personalities.Hotel Transylvania 2 is pretty entertaining, despite of not handling any subtle narrative, though I don't think many would be asking for that, but I may be a good suggestion. Maybe the only main disappointment is it's probably not as outrageous as its predecessor. I mean it's not totally restrained, of course, you would definitely still find a lot of crazy animation and wonderfully absurd facial expressions here, but maybe not as insane as the first movie did. I don't know, maybe it's just my expectations of witnessing more images to delightfully laugh at like the scene where Jonny was trying to scare a rat. And even the verbal humor where they were playing charades with the Invisible Man. But again, it's just my expectations. It's still pretty funny. The only worst thing you may find here are the blatant Sony products and I don't exactly know how you can shrug that off. Anyway, the movie still carries a much better message in the end, about being treated fairly, no matter how different you are to others. It shows it well and it seems pretty sincere. If you're not into this type of absurd animation, then at least its final note could make everything up to your viewing."
Clerks II,2006,7.3,A calamity at Dante and Randal's shops sends them looking for new horizons - but they ultimately settle at the fast food empire Mooby's.,"Wow, the return of the clerks, indeed! I went to a pre-screening last night of Clerks II and let me say that it was actually really good. The title, as Mr. Smith explained, has been simplified to undersell the movie so fans and moviegoers in general will be pleasantly surprised when they see it. So here is my contribution to word-of-mouth advertising: if you liked ANYTHING about Clerks I, go see Clerks II. More of the same and then some; and then some more. I have always been hit-or-miss with Kevin Smith and, sadly, the original Clerks was still my favorite of the group. And this movie is his best yet.(In fact, the only way I can appreciate ""Mallrats"" is to watch it with the audio commentary on.) To me, Mr. Smith is a lot funnier when he's just add-libbing. He said during his Q & A, last night, that they spent more time on this movie in pre-production than all the other movies combined and it shows. I am sure he was kidding but this movie is actually well written, very well acted (Rosario especially; she is the topping that is going to make this movie sell), and just well thought out in general. Good pacing (especially with the sight gags, one after another) and the Decalogue that I've come to appreciate is priceless. Like the argument over which franchise has the better ""Return"" movie; ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Star Wars"". Clerks II has become my favorite movie of the summer and I hope it becomes the sleeper hit of the summer because it is just that good. Oh, and Kevin, if you're reading this, sorry about the title, I am sure you pondered it. Maybe if you hadn't already used ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back""?"
Ant-Man,2015,7.2,"Armed with a super-suit with the astonishing ability to shrink in scale but increase in strength, cat burglar Scott Lang must embrace his inner hero and help his mentor, Dr. Hank Pym, pull off a plan that will save the world.","Reviewers say 'Ant-Man' is celebrated for its humor, performances, and unique Marvel concept. Paul Rudd's charm and comedic timing are frequently praised, alongside Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly's roles. Special effects and action sequences stand out, though pacing, underdeveloped villain, and clich√©s draw critique. Plot inconsistencies and character motivations are noted, yet many find it an enjoyable Marvel addition."
Fury,2014,7.6,"A grizzled tank commander makes tough decisions as he and his crew fight their way across Germany in April, 1945.","Strikingly far from mainstream war movie, Fury is unapologetically messy and brutal. The crude nature affects more than the visual, with the cast uttering unrefined profanity along with some military jargon. While the cinematography is splendid, it's nothing near the glossy or cinematic flair of other war movies, such as Saving Private Ryan, this is am unfiltered portrayal of war. It goes out of its way to display the gritty, sometimes intentionally overlooked aspect of war, the entire dirty ugliness of it.Brad Pitt as Wardaddy provides a solid leader persona. He's as consistent as he could be, and with the experience of war movie under his other belt, albeit a rather different one, it comes as no surprise that he performs amazingly. It's not a macho leader character as Wardaddy occasionally has doubt, mostly heavily suppressed. Shia LaBeouf as Bible is good, displaying better on-screen flair than most of his recent ones. Michael Pe√±a as Gordo and Jon Bernthal as Coon-Ass (classy name) round up the crew.Pe√±a works well, delivering a couple of good scene when least expected. Bernthal from Walking Dead has a certain niche, as an ally who sometimes looks like about to snap. Perhaps the highlight of Fury is Logan Lerman as Norman, the newly recruited crew. He's suddenly thrust into battle at its bloodiest. He gradually trades his innocence with experience of the horrid war out of necessity. Screenplay and dialogues are great, using direct, occasionally rude approach. The characters sound and act like soldiers, and it's not the usual presentable ones for cinema screen.What gives it more depth is how it's rooted on military. From inside of the tank or down time between skirmishes, every bit seems realistic. The strategy is sound, thus giving more weight to action sequences. This one is not for the fainthearted however, as limbs will fly or get chopped off clean. The movies doesn't dwell on particular gore for shock purpose, it simply brushes fatal graphic and burning bodies as if they are normal occurrences. Soundtracks are effective as well. While most tunes are subtle or orchestra for tense scenes, a few hymns, as if chanted by the soldiers themselves, are eerily moving.If there' are some minor complains of the movie, it's that the plot progresses in predictable way and the action in darker scenes are murky. Fury is a straightforward ride into the center of war. It's a less flamboyant, certainly not romanticized, but a damn fine one."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2016,6.4,Batman is manipulated by Lex Luthor to fear Superman. Superman¬¥s existence is meanwhile dividing the world and he is framed for murder during an international crisis. The heroes clash and force the neutral Wonder Woman to reemerge.,"Reviewers say 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' garners mixed feedback. Praises focus on Ben Affleck's and Henry Cavill's performances, along with impressive action sequences and visual effects. Criticisms target the plot, pacing, and character development. Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor is divisive, with varied opinions on his portrayal. The film's setup for future storylines and new character introductions is seen as both a strength and a distraction. Overall, the movie is lauded for its ambition and visuals but faulted for its intricate and occasionally confusing narrative."
Kingsman: The Secret Service,2014,7.7,"A spy organisation recruits a promising street kid into the agency's training program, while a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius.","Matthew Vaughn is now one of those directors that I can trust. This is my third movie I've seen by him and he still has not disappointed me. I remember when I first saw Kick Ass and was blown away with how great it is (probably in my top 25).This film is a big shout out (basically) to old spy films. It has everything: women, awesome fight scenes, gadgets, and even a ridiculous villain. Samuel L. Jackson plays the villain in this movie, and it's nice because we usually don't see him in that role. He also had a lisp in the entire movie so almost everything he said would make me chuckle. There's also a girl who has blades for feet, which is outrageous but because how Vaughn did an excellent job with choreographing fight scenes, her role worked really well into the film. It's the same for Jackson's character.The action scenes in general were fantastic. Like I said in the last paragraph, the choreography is very well done. This is also because of the smooth editing and shots Vaughn chose for all of the fight scenes. It's a very fun thing to see.There really aren't any huge gripes for this movie. The only small thing that I can think of is I wish there was a bit more of Cookson's character in the third act.Kingsman is a fun spy thriller movie that had me laughing many times and also had more than a few boundary-pushing moments. However it all worked because of the smooth editing and well-choreographed scenes along with great acting from the entire cast. If you are looking for a good popcorn movie to see, this is a movie you should see with your pals."
Coming out,2013,5.0,This is the story of present-day Hungary's most famous gay celebrity who openly admits his homosexuality and fights for gay rights in a society where so many alternative values are denied.,ReferencesStar Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope(1977)
Szezon,2004,6.2,"Three young friends, from the Hungarian countryside, want more sex and excitement in their life. Together they undertake a journey to Lake Balaton, where they hope to find plenty of summer fun as well as a temporary job.","The film is not about the countryside, not about the Hungarian way of living, not even about the decade it was made in, but much more. It's a beautiful movie about choices and learning to accept what we are meant to do in life. Yes, we can dream about something more, but eventually we must learn to cope with our (small or big) failures, and then join the life set out for us. The one that wishes for an average life is laughed at, but the one that realizes what to do to achieve it is the hero of this movie. He's choosing Eastern Sugar, the most obvious choice but he has to go far before he can see it. The final scene with the binoculars is outstanding."
The Bridge on the River Kwai,1957,8.1,"British POWs are forced to build a railway bridge across the river Kwai for their Japanese captors in occupied Burma, not knowing that the allied forces are planning a daring commando raid through the jungle to destroy it.","Reviewers say 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' is acclaimed for its performances, especially Alec Guinness, and its epic cinematography by David Lean. The film explores themes of pride, morality, and cultural clashes during wartime. However, it is criticized for historical inaccuracies and romanticizing a Japanese POW camp, which some argue dishonors real POW experiences. Opinions on its length and narrative vary, though many still consider it a classic for its artistic and emotional impact."
Made in Hungaria,2009,6.8,"In 1963 in Communist controlled Hungary, Miki, a young musician, returns after living in America and tries to win back his old flame Vera who has taken up with a musician rival of his named R√∂n√© who is also a part-time thief on the side.","Well, I have to say that this movie is amazing! (compared to other Hungarian movies ... ) The film is not only a really great comedy, but also gives an insight into the life of the 60's (in Hungary). Furthermore, the music makes it so much better!! We all know that the story is about a musician, Mikl√≥s Fenyo, who has lived in America, but his family had to move back to Hungary. I also must mention the actors, mainly Szab√≥ Kimmel Tam√°s, who played so well. In my opinion, this comedy/musical contains everything what the genre requires; from the house party to the love. All in all, I really enjoyed every single part of the movie. That's why, I recommend it anyone, whatever age you are if you need distraction.Well done ;)"
Moszkva t√©r,2001,7.8,"1989 is an important year in the political history of Hungary. However, Petya and his friends couldn't care less. They are about to graduate high school. The only important things to them are the parties, girls, making some easy cash. And of course, passing the upcoming exam with the leaked questions.","I just saw this movie in what I think is the only movie theater in Budapest playing it with English subtitles. Situated in Budapest in 1989, is the story of a group of fellow students at a secondary school, and their graduation in the transition times before the collapse of communism. Simple, fresh and and with an optimistic feeling. Maybe a little bit too innocent. It lacks from any long and slow scenes I was expecting from what I think is the first Hungarian film I saw. I won't say is anything brilliant, but I liked this refreshing view of the particular way of the Hungarian.You'll probably go out of the cinema with a smile on your face."
Allegiant,2016,5.7,"After the earth-shattering revelations of Insurgent, Tris must escape with Four beyond the wall that encircles Chicago to finally discover the shocking truth of the world outside.","""The Divergent Series: Allegiant"" is another part of this too long and boring franchise. The saga of Tris and Four and their friends is repetitive and predictable, using clich√©s and special effects. The screenplay is poor and stupid. For example, David is capable to close doors and remotely controls the city; why does he need someone to release the gas in Chicago? The worst is that the story does not end and there will be another sequel to gross more money for the producers. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""A S√©rie Divergente: Convergente"" (""The Divergent Series: convergent"")"
Clerks,1994,7.7,"A day in the lives of two convenience clerks named Dante and Randal as they annoy customers, discuss movies, and play hockey on the store roof.","Clerks (1994)**** (out of 4)Kevin Smith's cult classic about a two store clerks (Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson) who have nothing to do except be bored and deal the cards life gives them. It's hard to believe this film is now fourteen-years-old as it seems just like yesterday when it made a splash on the indie circuit. This was my first time watching this in at least six or seven years and it hasn't lost any of its magic. I still think Smith hit on something truly great in the fact that he manages to take this type of job and show all the hassles and frustration that comes with it. I believe it was Roger Ebert's review that mentioned movies never deal with jobs unless the job is that of a cop, robber or something like that yet here we get to see the life of a clerk who is stuck at a job he hates and surrounded by people that can't really add too much to his life. The real key here of course is Smith's screenplay, which I'd call downright brilliant. To have 90-minutes of nothing but dialogue speaks a lot for his screenplay as it remains so constantly entertaining with the majority of the jokes working. The politically incorrect nature of the humor from the ""37"" to various other sexual things is downright hilarious and that includes the surprise in the bathroom. The performances in the film have taken a lot of unfair heat in my opinion because while they aren't perfect I do think they fit the roles just fine and mixed with the B&W it makes the film seem all the more like a documentary."
Everest,2015,7.1,"On May 10, 1996, mountain guides Rob Hall and Scott Fischer combine their expedition teams for a final ascent to the summit of Mount Everest. With little warning, a storm strikes the mountain and the climbers must now battle to survive.","I managed to watch this on an HBO channel while hanging out in the Colorado Rockies for a few days. It is a pretty well filmed story of the tragedy on the Everest climb in May 1996. Several people died, including some experienced guides, when the weather turned mean. Perhaps the best part of the movie is the first half, showing the people and what it takes to train and pay for such an adventure.I remember it because Beck Weathers, a Dallas area physician, was one of the men in the expedition. He had some grave difficulties and was left for dead on the mountain. However he stumbled down the mountain in the morning, badly frostbitten, eventually losing part of his right arm plus all the fingers on his left hand, parts of both feet, and part of his nose. But he survived in what turned out to be a most expensive and life-changing experience.I believe I'll stay on my comfortable couch and watch it."
The Loft,2014,6.3,"Five married men secretly share a penthouse loft in the city where they can carry out secret affairs. However, their fantasy becomes a nightmare when they discover a dead woman in the loft and realize one of the group must be involved.","Having seen the original movie 'Loft' by Erik Van Looy (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0926762/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), I was hoping for a fresh take. But a fresh take is obviously not why they hired the same Van Looy to direct this version. This is essentially the same movie, just without subtitles.In short, the building blocks of 'The Loft' are a set of plot twists. They are mostly silly, suffering from a few red herrings that hurt the story's credibility, but it's still entertaining to watch them unfold. Largely because the movie flows well for the most part, with only a few dull moments in the first half.Although I preferred the exterior design of the original loft, the overall cinematography of 'The Loft' feels a little warmer and more comfortable. Only a little though, because the characters in it are stone cold. James Marsden is the warmest character in the frame, but like everybody else he doesn't get enough to work with to make for a convincing character that the audience can identify with. The characters are The Loft's biggest flaw (as they were in the original), which is especially disappointing since making you care about characters has often been a strong and successful focus in Bart de Pauw's earlier scripts. There are just too many of them, and as a consequence most of the dialog in the back story scenes is expositional and feels awkward. There's never an opportunity for development. The characters are just there to lead you from one twist to the next.The overall acting suffers as a result. Strangely I felt that Rhona Mitra, with barely any screen time, delivers one of the better performances, with obvious anger below her coldness, yet just enough restrain. Wentworth Miller does what he does best. He doesn't seem to care much, but still feels like a good fit, even with the little information we get for his character. Matthias Schoenaerts' presence is undeniable. But as a guy who seems to be on edge pretty much all the time, his marriage seems plainly unlikely, and his past couldn't be revealed more clumsily. Still, he's a welcome contrast to the otherwise held back main cast. It's a pity that he was clearly suffering from sickness or fatigue in a few scenes, where it's blatantly obvious how much he had to strain his voice. It's arguably suiting his character, but it's still distracting.The concept of this story lends itself to a much darker movie, and this just feels like a missed opportunity. I can't help but wonder how this would've worked as a film noir. You have five characters that could easily be despicable and instantly more interesting, and the women couldn't be more fatale. Of course, film noir doesn't sell anymore, so instead we get a bright and shiny thriller that doesn't thrill, that keeps you guessing, but doesn't make you ask questions. It deals with edgy themes, but it barely skims them and focuses on polish instead.7/10. It's definitely an enjoyable watch, but only for people who're into the whole whodunit thing. Not if you're looking for anything more. It's successful at what it is and doesn't pretend to be anything else, but I can't help but sense the potential for something more."
"6:3, avagy j√°tszd √∫jra Tutti",1999,5.7,"The 40 year-old football fan named Tutti passes out during work and he travels back in time to 1953 when the Hungarian football team beat England in the ""Match Of The Century"".","The makers, especially P√©ter T√≠m√°r wanted to invoke the atmosphere of the communist dictatorship of R√°kosi era lasted from 1947 to 1956. I think they've managed to reconstruct it very much: if you read the history books about the era and newspapers from that times, if you listened to your parents' and grandparents' tales, you will experience the similarities are shocking. The main character (Tutti - K√°roly Eperjes) is excellent, Eperjes, acting an eccentric, but likable crank is in his royal spirits.The film is a great work with a good story and great points. An absurd, tragicomic and fictive, but historically exact memoir from the early fifties."
Mad Max: Fury Road,2015,8.1,"In a post-apocalyptic wasteland, a woman rebels against a tyrannical ruler in search for her homeland with the aid of a group of female prisoners, a psychotic worshipper and a drifter named Max.","Reviewers say 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is acclaimed for its intense action, groundbreaking stunts, and practical effects. The post-apocalyptic desert setting and scarce resources are pivotal. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron's performances are lauded for their chemistry and depth. The film's feminist themes and strong female characters are highlighted, though some critique the story's simplicity and lack of backstory. The visual style and cinematography are frequently praised. Despite minor criticisms, it is often hailed as a modern action classic."
Colonia,2015,7.0,"A young woman's desperate search for her abducted boyfriend draws her into the infamous Colonia Dignidad, a sect nobody has ever escaped from.","A religious cult in Chile run by ex-Nazis?!? It may sound like a bizarre work of fiction, but the location portrayed in the historical drama ""Colonia"" (NR, 1:50) was all too real (except for the fictional romance at the center of the film). But before I get into my plot summary, I think that a little historical context is in order: In September 1973, a U.S.-backed military coup wrested control of the government of Chile from democratically-elected socialist president Salvador Allende and placed power in the hands of army commander-in-chief Augusto Pinochet. Under his 17-year rule, dissidents were persecuted, arrested, kidnapped, deposed, tortured and murdered. Pinochet's government used the remote Colonia Dignidad (Colony of Dignity) as a place to torture and murder some of the regime's political opponents. The public face of the colony was that of a charitable and educational organization. It was actually a religious cult where former Nazi medic Paul Sch√§fer imposed a strict Baptist interpretation of the Bible on all of his followers, many of who had emigrated with him from Germany. He forced them to live in dormitories segregated by gender, and with parents separated from their children, whom Sch√§fer sexually molested.Daniel Br√ºhl plays Daniel, a political activist from Germany who has been living in Chile for a few months working with a group of young people supporting President Allende. Daniel's girlfriend, Lena (Emma Watson), is a flight attendant who takes advantage of her week-long stopover in Santiago to spend time with Daniel. When a military coup suddenly drives Allende from power, the new government starts rounding up political dissidents, including Daniel ‚Äì and Lena, who happens to be with him when he's arrested. In a soccer stadium, a man wearing a black hood identifies Allende supporters, including Daniel, who is whisked away in a van. Lena is able to trace the markings on the vehicle to the secretive and remote ""Colonia Dignidad"" compound, about 200 miles south of Santiago. She makes her way there and asks to join. ""I want to know the way of the Lord,"" she says, wearing a small cross around her neck.In her attempt to rescue her lost love, Lena is sacrificing her freedom ‚Äì and putting her very life at risk. A harsh old woman named Gisela (Richenda Carey) takes her to meet the cult's leader, German expatriate and lay preacher Paul Sch√§fer (Michael Nyqvist). ""Once you join us, you must remain,"" explains Sch√§fer. Lena agrees, in spite of observing his Christian fanaticism and some of his innate creepiness. Gisela relieves Lena of the small bag she had brought with her, gives her a few items including a set of linen, and assigns her a bed in the female dormitory. Most of the women show no interest in talking to the new arrival, but Lena befriends another young woman named Doro (Jeanne Werner) and, later, another named Ursel (Vicky Krieps). As Lena joins the women in their daily work in the fields and in other food preparation activities, she learns what she can about the camp and keeps her eyes peeled for Daniel.Daniel has survived severe physical abuse at the hands of the Chilean secret police in the colony's subterranean torture chamber, but he is a bit worse for the wear. Besides his physical injuries, his speech is slurred and he now talks and acts like a child. Lena finally catches sight of Daniel when she steals a glance through the window of the colony's assembly hall during a men's meeting and is obviously concerned about his state of mind. Soon after, at a rare meeting with the cult's men and women all together, Lena takes the risk of approaching Daniel, hoping that the two of them can come up with a plan to escape the cult, something no one has done before. But there's much more at stake than ""just"" the fate of two young lovers. Besides the terrible ways that Sch√§fer uses and abuses his followers, it turns out that he's also into some other nasty business that further reduces even the slim chance that Daniel and Lena have to get away for good.""Colonia"" takes a little-known chapter in history and spins it into an interesting and entertaining tale of romance and danger. The story is perhaps best understood as a combination of ""The Boys from Brazil"", M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"" and Ben Affleck's Oscar-winning ""Argo""¬Ö if you can imagine that. This film's unusual setting contributes to its originality, as does telling a story in which it's the woman who comes to rescue the man. The actors are well cast, and this accomplished multi-national ensemble consistently offers up lived-in performances. The direction, by Florian Gallenberger (who won an Oscar for his 2000 live action short film ""I Want to Be¬Ö""), sometimes feels a little disjointed, but he mostly keeps things moving and builds some serious tension into the movie's plot. The script (co-written by Torsten Wenzel and Gallenberger) is creative and smart. There may not be much actual dignity in the Colonia Dignidad compound, but this film dignifies itself with some quality story-telling. ""A-"""
The Walk,2015,7.3,"In 1974, high-wire artist Philippe Petit recruits a team of people to help him realize his dream: to walk the immense void between the World Trade Center towers.","Robert Zemeckis continue's to be of the best director's in Hollywood.

As a survivor of 9/11, I couldn't help but cry at the end of the movie. Seeing the Twin Towers rising in all their glory, basking in the sunset and reminding us of their beauty that so many of us took for granted, brought back so many emotions for me.

Dheepan,2015,7.2,Dheepan is a Sri Lankan Tamil warrior who flees to France and ends up working as a caretaker outside Paris.,"Dheepan (the first leading role for Jesuthasan Antonythasan) is a Tamil fighter. He flees war-torn Sri Lanka with Yalini (Kalieaswari Srinivasan) and Illayaal (Claudine Vinasithamby), posing as his wife and daughter , hoping that they will make it easier for him to get asylum in Europe . The makeshift family arrives in France and Dheepan finds work as a caretaker for an apartment building that is also a drug front . As Dheepan finds work as the caretaker of a run-down housing block in the suburbs ruled by a nasty gangster (Vincent Rottiers) . But the daily violence he faces off quickly reopens his war wounds , and Dheepan is forced to reconnect with his warrior's instincts to protect his new family .Jacques Audiard's follow-up to Rust and Bone took home the Palme d'Or at this year's Cannes Film Festival . This thoughtful film has emotion , intense drama , thrills , political events and violence . Dheepan thrives on silence and it results to be a French film shot nearly entirely in Tamil language . A nearly wordless opening showing the eponymous character's tragic departure , the desperate meeting of Dheepan, Yalini, and Illayaal, and the voyage west is particularly effective . Audiard jumps smoothly through time and forces the audience to catch up with only the barest context, producing a marvelously suspenseful prologue . Good performance from Jesuthasan Antonythasan as Dheepan , a Sri Lankan Tamil warrior who flees to France and ends up working as a caretaker outside Paris . Jesuthasan was a boy soldier with the Tamil Tigers before fleeing Sri Lanka for France, just like the character he plays in the movie ; he is a writer, novelist and political activist in real-life . Excellent female lead actors Kalieaswari Srinivasan and Claudine Vinasithamby , both of whom never acted in a feature film before . Special mention for Vincent Rottiers as a tough mobster . Being first feature film of cinematographer √âponine Momenceau who creates an evocative as well as atmospheric cinematography and composer Nicolas Jaar who composes an adequate score . Being shot on location in Mandapam, Tamil Nadu, Rameshwaram, Tamil Nadu, Ooty, Tamil Nadu, India and La Coudraie, Poissy, Yvelines, France .The motion picture was well directed by Jacques Audiard who gets phenomenal interpretations from the three leads , who are all essentially non-actors . Audiard is a good French writer and filmmaker . In the eighties he wrote the screenplays of some successful movies like ""Mortelle Randonnee"" (1983), ""Reveillon Chez Bob"" (1984), ""Saxo"" (1987), ""Frequence Meurtre"" (1988) and ""Grosse Fatigue"" (1994). Most of those films were thrillers directed by prestigious filmmakers like Claude Miller and Michel Blanc . He also directed some well received short movies . Thanks to the success of those movies he was able, in 1994, to raise up the money to make his first movie ""Regarde Les Hommes Tomber"" starred by Mathieu Kassovitz . Kassovitz also became the star of his second movie ""Un Heros Tres Discret"" released in the Festival de Cannes in 1996 where it won the award for best screenplay. In 2001 he made his third movie ""Sur Mes Levres"" about a love story between two outsiders . His last movie, ""De Battre Mon Coeur Sest Arr√™te"" was released in the Berlin festival of 2005 . His greatest success was ¬®A prophet¬® . With those movies, Audiard has become the new master of the ""polar"" or French thriller and inheritor of others great French directors like Jean-Pierre Melville and Henri Georges-Clouzot ."
Suffragette,2015,6.9,"In 1912 London, a young working mother is galvanized into radical political activism supporting the right for women to vote, and is willing to meet violence with violence to achieve this end.","Whilst most men would agree that giving women the vote was a dreadful mistake (put that stone down ladies¬Ö. it's just a joke), the astonishing story behind the UK social upheaval that was the Suffragette movement is well overdue a serious cinematic treatment. And a serious treatment Sarah Gavron's new film most certainly is: you exit the cinema feeling about as wrung out as the linen in the heroine Maud's workhouse-style laundry.Carey Mulligan plays Maud Watts, an ordinary and anonymous working woman who progressively gets sucked into the anarchic rabble-rousing of an East-end branch of the Pankhurst's Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). With operations run out of a chemist's shop by Edith Ellyn (Helena Bonham Carter) and her sympathetic husband, Maud risks a criminal record and the shame associated with that to pursue her ideals. Police pressure is applied by special forces copper Arthur Steed (Harry Potter's Brendan Gleeson) and personal pressure is put on her by her husband (played by Ben Whishaw, soon to be seen again as 'Q') and her alleged fitness to be a mother to their young son George (Adam Michael Dodd). As politicians continue to ignore the issue, the actions build to one of the most historic events of the period.The struggle is seen very much through the limited prism of this select group of women. But where I really liked this film is in the slow awakening of Maud's character. In many ways it is like the germination of a seed that we are seeing on the screen. She starts without any interest in the movement and even mid-way through the film she is adamant that she is ""not a suffragette"", despite evidence to the contrary. Mulligan is, as always, completely brilliant in the role.The supporting cast are all strong with Gleeson being particularly watchable as the lawman with a grudging respect for Maud and her cause. Meryl Streep makes a powerful cameo as Emily Pankhurst: but it is a short and sweet performance. Maud's friend Violet (Anne-Marie Duff) is also outstanding, her gaunt face delivering a haunting performance.Whilst there are some highly emotionally charged scenes in the film, in a political sense the film has a curious lack of passion at times. A keynote speech to Lloyd George for example should have been electric - yet the Abi Morgan's script doesn't quite do the scene justice and if I was the MP I wouldn't have been impressed (which perhaps was the point).I also had issues with some of the cinematography. Carey Mulligan has such an expressive and photogenic face that extreme close ups should work brilliantly. And yet filming it with a hand-held camera produces a constantly shifting image which was extremely distracting. Elsewhere in the art department though 1912 London is beautifully recreated, through both special effects, costume and make-up.Alexandre Desplat delivers a touching score with a clever underlying drumbeat of change.Suffragette is a solid historical drama, that tells an important social tale¬Ö a tale that graphically illustrates how much the world has really changed, and changed for the better, in a mere hundred years. Above all, the film concludes with the astounding fact that Switzerland only gave women the vote in 1971 (and in fact with one canton holding out on local issues until 1991).

Brooklyn,2015,7.5,"An Irish immigrant lands in 1950s Brooklyn, where she quickly falls into a romance with a local. When her past catches up with her, however, she must choose between two countries and the lives that exist within.","Reviewers say 'Brooklyn' is celebrated for its heartfelt portrayal of immigration, love, and identity, with Saoirse Ronan's compelling performance as Eilis earning high praise. The 1950s setting in Brooklyn and Ireland is noted for its authenticity and nostalgic atmosphere. Themes of home, belonging, and the immigrant experience resonate strongly, though some find the plot slow-moving. The romantic elements, despite being predictable, are appreciated for their sincerity. The supporting cast enhances the film's emotional depth, making 'Brooklyn' a touching, well-crafted drama."
The Machinist,2004,7.6,An industrial worker who hasn't slept in a year begins to doubt his own sanity.,"a memorable character. his sin. his truth. an one of the most fascinating roles for Christian Bale. The Machinist reminds Crime and judgment. but it is not an adaptation. only a great trip in heart of strange existence, obscure crisis of a man who , step by step, becomes a shadow. a film about truth. as revelation. as key of freedom and source of sense. a film about love but not exactly in the terms of Raskolnikov - Sonia's terms. admirable exercise about honesty. and about the cage of the past. a film who must see it. for artistic virtues. for inspired script. for performances. and for a motif who remains secret long time after its end."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2015,7.7,"As a new threat to the galaxy rises, Rey, a desert scavenger, and Finn, an ex-stormtrooper, must join Han Solo and Chewbacca to search for the one hope of restoring peace.","Reviewers say 'Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens' is a nostalgic and thrilling return, blending old and new elements. Praised for strong performances, especially Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, and compelling new characters. Visual effects and John Williams' score are highlights. Criticized for similarities to 'A New Hope' and plot holes. Most view it as a worthy, foundational addition to the franchise."
Ghost in the Shell,1995,7.9,A cyborg policewoman and her partner hunt a mysterious and powerful hacker called the Puppet Master.,"Upon Ghost in the Shell's release in 1995, the Western world was still largely unfamiliar with manga, but had already had its head turned by Katsuhiro Ohtomo's Akira (1988). Blending philosophical musings with blistering action, Ghost in the Shell captured the imagination of it's new audience, helping kick-start the Japanophilia that runs so blatantly through most modern Western cartoons and lines the bookcases of many a teenager. While it certainly has its flaws, this was the first time that casual Western audiences who were new to manga had seen a cartoon be as meditative as is explosive. And for those that didn't catch it, no doubt they would have watched The Matrix (1999) four years later, a film that arguably 'borrows' a lot more from Ghost in the Shell that it lets on.In the future, technology has become so far advanced that all aspects of life are interconnected through an electronic network. Major Motoko Kusanagi (Atsuko Tanaka), a soldier working for government agency Section 9, is a cyborg, and is able to access this network through plugs in the back of her head. She and her team are assigned to catch an elusive 'ghost-hacker' known as the Puppet Master (Iemasa Kayumi), an intelligent entity created by the government, who they lost control of when it became self-aware. When the Puppet Master surfaces in the mangled body of an artificial human shell, Kusanagi faces a crisis of identity.Disappointingly, the film begins with gratuitous nudity, showing off the fine female form (with giant breasts, of course) of Major Kusanagi just before she takes a plunge off a building to nail some bad guys. Manga caters heavily for its audience, be it sexually-frustrated, highly- stressed businessmen or horny teenagers who have no doubt been bombarded with images of giggling, short-skirted school girls throughout their young life. Thankfully, these moments are brief, and prove to be not much more than a mild distraction from the stunning animation on show. Things are grim in the future, but they're certainly beautiful to look at.The sexism aside, Kusanagi is an interesting character. When a man realises his wife and daughter are nothing more than an implanted memory, he fails to comprehend it. Kusanagi, with her mixture of organic and mechanical body parts and uploaded memories, struggled to define what it is to be human. Her hunt for the Puppet Master, who is seemingly a new kind of being, becomes a hunt for identity. Is it enough to be aware of what and who you are? The philosophy, although provocative, is heavy-handed. Conversations about humanity between Kusanagi and her second-in-command Bateau (Akio Otsuka) are delivered with a monotony worthy of a whiny emo teen, and I found the film's first half quite a head-scratcher. But things thankfully do become clearer, and the film is still, almost twenty years later, one of the best examples of the genre.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,1998,7.5,An oddball journalist and his psychopathic lawyer travel to Las Vegas for a series of psychedelic escapades.,"This is far from your everyday movie, and only for those with a deep appreciation for the diversity of film-making, or fans of Hunter S. Thompson. This does not mean those mentioned will enjoy it, although definitely respect the attempt. I personally found it fascinating. To portray a permanently drug induced state to the big screen was done with creativity and subtle humour. You could expect nothing less from director Terry Gilliam who has played such a massive role in the brilliant and original Monty Python works.Having never read any of Hunter S. Thompson's work, I get the impression that justice is done for the adaptation to the big screen. An absolutely quality cast must be credited for this, ensuring a natural performance is achieved. Las Vegas which features strongly throughout the movie seems to be so appropriate when dealing with this subject matter, they just seem to go hand in hand."
Enemy of the State,1998,7.3,A lawyer becomes targeted by a corrupt politician and his N.S.A. goons when he accidentally receives key evidence to a politically motivated crime.,"Enemy of the State was released in 1998, only 3 years before the Nein Eleven false flag that excused the launching of the most intrusive surveillance apparatus the world has ever known.And just like the Congressdoosh in the movie, everybody except for RonP aul said it would only be used on dirty furriners to protect the Good Ol' USofA.But as Edwards Nowden and later Julia Nassange revealed a decade later, America's alphabet agencies soon turned the surveillance against Americans themselves.Fast-forward to 2021, where it turns out the movie plays more like a documentary than a political thriller. The good guys are now the bad guys. Politicians are hopelessly compromised. The sp00ks are in charge. All our moves are on camera somewhere. Everything we write - including our movie reviews - is logged. There is no privacy.Somewhere in the bowels of Hollywood there is probably a script in development about the disingtegration of the Western World, probably disguised as a Fall of the Roman Empire Netflix series, featuring barbarian hordes and starving serfs. Twenty years from now it will all come depressingly true.Enjoy the film !"
Angel Heart,1987,7.2,"In 1955 New Orleans, small-time private investigator Harry Angel is hired by a man who calls himself Louis Cypher to track down a singer named Johnny Favorite, but the investigation takes an unexpected and somber turn.","Such an impressive movie, if like me you're a fan of noir, or neo noir, then you will absolutely love this movie.The first thing you will be struck by is the appearance of the film, it is a visual masterpiece, the attention to detail is flawless, you could actually turn the colour off, and imagine this being made in 1955.Secondly, the atmosphere, smoke filled rooms, the clothes, music, accents, just awesome to behold, they got the tone spot on.It's a great story, it takes a few moments for you to know what's happening, and get the direction, but you will.Finally the acting, Rourke is at his absolute best, one of the best films I've seen him in, he is tremendous, it's so nice to see him in his handsome pre surgery years. De Niro, what can you say, he's just incredible.Captivating, 9/10."
Too Big to Fail,,7.2,Chronicles the financial meltdown of 2008 and centers on Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.,"The movie itself was put together very well following the chronicles of the fiasco that unfolded during the credit crunch. Where it went horribly wrong is by humanizing Hank Paulson. Making him seem vulnerable and genuine and sincere. It has recently been published that Saint Paulson tipped off 20 or so hedge funds about the coming collapse so they could unload their positions. And this film is attempting to portray him as the victim and the hero and laud him with applause for working so diligently on this problem. His colleagues at Goldman cleaned up on the CDS contracts betting on the inevitable crisis they knew was coming. James Woods did a very good job at making Dick Fuld's loathsome character believable, though."
Men of Honor,2000,7.2,"Carl Brashear is an ambitious sharecropper who joins the U.S. Navy to become the world's first black master diver. But as he works through diving training, the racist Master Chief sets out to make Carl's journey as difficult as possible.","Men of Honor stars Cuba Gooding Jr., as real life Navy Diver Carl Brashear who defied a man's Navy to become the first African American Navy Diver. Sometimes by his side and sometimes his adversary there was one man who Carl Brashear really admired. His name was Master Chief Billy Sunday (Robert DeNiro). Sunday in a lot of ways pushed, aggravated and helped Carl become the man he wanted to be.I loved Cuba in this film. His portrayal here is as liberating and as powerful as Denzel Washington was in The Hurricane. Through every scene we can see his passion, motivation and stubbornness to achieve his dream. We can see the struggle within in him as he embarks to make his father proud. I also loved how the director created and brought forth a lot of tension in some of the key diving scenes. Brashear's encounter with a submarine during a salvage mission is heart-stopping and brilliant.The only fault I could see would have to lie in the supporting cast. Cuba and DeNiro's characters are very intricate and exciting to watch. Which does make you a little sad when they have to butt heads with such two-dimensional supporting characters. The evil Lt. Cmdr. Hanks, Sunday's wife (Charlize Theron), the eccentric diving school colonel (Hal Holbrook) and Cuba's love interest are the characters I found to not have very much depth. What could have made these characters more substantial and more effective was a little more time to develop them. Why was that colonel always in his tower? How come Sunday's wife was so bitter and always drunk?Another curious question has to be this. What happened to Carl Brashear's wedding? I mean if this film is chronicling this man's life wouldn't his wedding be an important event? Maybe it's just me. Men of Honor, however, is a perfect example of the triumph and faith that the human spirit envelops. This film will inspire and make you feel for this man's struggle. Which I do believe was the reason this powerful story was told. My hat goes off to you Carl Brashear. I really admire your strength."
Charlie Mortdecai,2015,5.5,"Juggling angry Russians, the British Mi5, and an international terrorist, debonair art dealer and part-time rogue Charlie Mortdecai races to recover a stolen painting rumored to contain a code that leads to lost gold.","Adapted from the book anthology by the same name written by Kyril Bonfiglioli, 'Mortdecai' is silly fun! Though never hilarious, this recent box-office disappoint isn't entirely bad either.'Mortdecai' Synopsis: Juggling angry Russians, the British Mi5, and an international terrorist, debonair art dealer and part time rogue Charlie Mortdecai races to recover a stolen painting rumored to contain a code that leads to lost Nazi gold.'Mortdecai' needed more wit & humor, no doubt. But what is served in this action-comedy, isn't unbearable. Some of it actually works, as the bumbling protagonist gets into a series of wacky moments. Even the supporting characters are fairly appealing. But, in totality, I wanted to laugh more.Eric Aronson's Screenplay is continuously silly & on-track, but not foolproof. David Koepp's Direction is impressive. So is the Cinematography. The Editing, however, lacks sharpness. Costume Design & Action-Sequences, are fair.Performance-Wise: Johnny Depp as Mortdecai, is in good goofy mode. The versatile actor seems to be enjoying himself, although his talent is much above a film such as this. Ewan McGregor is first-rate. Gwyneth Paltrow looks aged & tired here. Paul Bettany has his moments. Olivia Munn is seductive. Jeff Goldblum appears in a cameo.On the whole, 'Mortdecai' won't make you fall of your seat with laughter, nor will it want you to pull your hair in anger. Its strictly a one-time watch."
Spectre,2015,6.8,"A cryptic message from James Bond's past sends him on a trail to uncover the existence of a sinister organisation named SPECTRE. With a new threat dawning, Bond learns the terrible truth about the author of all his pain in his most recent missions.","I have to say I was one of the few people who actually liked this movie. Its fun and over the top action sequences are heavily inspired by the Roger Moore Bond films. But that isn't a bad thing at all. Although the movie might lack its predecessor's cohesive plot, it certainly makes up for it with the biggest explosion in the world and the absolutely ridiculous plane chase sequence in the snow. Also the inclusion of the classic White tuxedo was a pleasant surprise. While it may not be as good as Casino Royale or Goldeneye and not as well written as Skyfall, it is certainly enjoyable to watch."
My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2,2016,6.0,A Portokalos family secret brings the beloved characters back together for an even bigger and Greeker wedding.,"Weirdly found this film OK. The reviews aren't great so I thought I'll tell exactly what's in it. Multiple love stories at once all tied together with a family upset and something to do with passing knowledge on to different generations.We have seen this format so many times and by now we should be getting bored. Surely? But no, look it wasn't the most amazing film. The cinematography was average so was the script and the plot. But it knows what it is. And more importantly it wasn't trying to be something it's not. So it's that feel good family love story. And it does make you feel good and it is surprisingly funny. The only one thing that annoyed me was that they used a certain character for comic purposes at nearly the end of every sequence. But apart from that it's all good.If you like these types of film then you will love it. Even if this isn't your favorite genre but your feeling down then give it a try it's almost certain to cheer you up. And if you hate this genre then I don't even know why your reading this or on this page. You probably decided you were not seeing it when you saw the trailer.Tom"

My uncle was already living in Philly so it made greencards and citizenship easier.We were very lucky: As climate change and inequality course through the world, the number of refugees will climb to unimaginable heights. Americans will seek refuge in their own country as parts of the USA will become uninhabitable.So the citizen is a timely movie about many things- isolation, loneliness, being a cultural outcast, the immigration process and much else- and I wish I liked it more. But its sledgehammer style story telling and eat your spinach messaging where every thought is excruciatingly, explicitly conveyed to the viewer without subtlety, leaves much to be desired. It's a shame because the cast is mostly great, tho sometimes reduced to stock characters (the official, the racist son, the noble migrants) denied their complexity in service of a story that wants to but stops a hair shy of valorizing migrants and demonizing natives."
Point Break,2015,5.3,"A young FBI agent infiltrates an extraordinary team of extreme sports athletes he suspects of masterminding a string of unprecedented, sophisticated corporate heists.","The original was a great movie with classic actors. Sure it's dated today, but still carries it's own weight. This movie while containing some visually stunning cinematography, some how manages to just drag and drag. As others have commented it comes of like a commercial. The special affects don't seem that special. It's like you are watching a commercial with snowboarding and sky diving designed to sell Redbull. While I should be in awe at what they are doing on screen, i find myself yawning and wondering when is it all just going to end. There is no real tension building, no sense of fear that Utah will be discovered, unlike the original, where his cover was about to be blown with each scene. I highly recommend passing on this one, it's a borefest."
Czukor Show,2010,6.3,A man from the country and his troupe arrive for the 'problem-solving' show of a fictional national television channel.,
The Fountain,2006,7.1,"As a modern-day scientist, Tommy is struggling with mortality, desperately searching for the medical breakthrough that will save the life of his cancer-stricken wife, Izzi.","This is one half of a review. Some films need to be seen more than once to be fully grasped. This is one of them.I would like to read Paul Schrader's review of this film. Not because he wrote the screenplay for Taxi Driver, but because he wrote a book about ""Transcendental Style in Film"" and ""The Fountain"" is certainly in this category of film-making.Because of Schrader's book, I've been viewing as many films by Dreyer, Ozu, and Bresson, that I can lay my hands on ¬ñ especially those by Robert Bresson. There are many parallels between Aronofsky's film and Bresson, and yet their style is completely different ¬ñ it's like comparing a Tintype photograph with a Van Gogh: Bresson is understated while Aronofsky is over the top. Yet, both directors create films that are best viewed more than once. Both styles leave a lot to the imagination which can be frustrating on the first viewing. I certainly was. This is why I consider this to be one half of a review. I've only seen this film once.The Fountain has three story lines: one set in the past, one in the present, and one set ostensibly in the future. The three timelines weave in an out of each other like a Chinese puzzle. The past is poetic, the present is realistic, and the future is plausible. Moreover the future be either a real future (as cinematic futures go) or merely a dream of the future. So, this could be a very subjective story that takes place now. It is ambiguous, mysterious, and subject to personal interpretation. In this regard, The Fountain, is very much like the films of Bresson.Bresson once mentioned that he intentionally avoids the obvious in his film; it is the mystery that propels the viewer's interest forward. Often later scenes reveal the mystery of that earlier enigma. This is a very literary form of film-making. Last night, I was surrounded by people in the audience who wanted every plot detail handed to us on a silver platter. As this was a sneak preview, we all got in for free. Some were probably expecting the extremes of ""Requiem for a Dream"". A group next to me left early. As I was leaving, I heard a teen say into her cell phone ""don't bother to pay for this film ¬ñ wait for it when it is on TV ¬Ö for free"". And I agree: if you can tolerate a lot of commercial TV and prefer magazines to books, then you may not like this film. If you read some of the reviews, for Bresson, you'll get some of the same impatience. These are films which break with what you'd expect from a film. Forget that you're in a movie theater; this piece will reward an open mind.The acting in The Fountain is very dynamic but there was not enough breathing room for empathy. There is only one break in the tension when there could have been more. Instead, to serve the three story lines, the tension feels like one continuous climb. A tearful moment, from one storyline, leads to another tearful moment in another storyline. The group next to me ¬ñ the one that ultimately left ¬ñ were snickering. It feels like overacting, even though each performance is convincing, on its own. So, I felt my empathy in suspension. A different edit would have added more power to the emotional timbre of the acting. I find myself wishing for another 20 minutes of story to draw me in.The music blended very well with the story ¬ñ they never stood apart, which is ideal for a cinematic score. The visuals, however, did break the suspension of disbelief, on a few occasions. In one case, there was a tracking shot that uses a unique point of view that took me out of the story, thinking ""wow, cool shot!"", instead of thinking ""I wonder where he is going"". There is a certain amusement ride feel to some of the cinematography and Special Effects which detracts from the story. But, these shots are not gimmicks. They're premonitions and echoes of action in other sequences. They are crazy bold, like Van Gogh's brushstrokes tracing out a landscape. These bold strokes are the first thing that I notice, about ""The Fountain"". But, upon reflection, they paint a picture that is rather calm.I look forward to seeing this movie again."
Point Break,1991,7.3,An F.B.I. Agent goes undercover to catch a gang of surfers who may be bank robbers.,"Point Break is one of those films that everybody loves, but that nobody actually talks about all that often. It is a film that if you mention it in conversation, everyone else around is bound to say how much they enjoyed it.The film's two main assets are unexpected ones, in the form of the direction and  the script. The direction by Kathryn Bigelow is nothing short of excellent. Her handling of the action and suspense scenes is exciting and riveting. The two sky-diving scenes are brilliant as is the foot chase through the streets (and houses) of the city. The script, by W. Peter Illif, is also very good and the best thing about the film. The plot is multi-layered and has an original relationship between the hero and the villain. The way the story resolves itself and the ultimate resolutions is excellent, by the standards of most Hollywood action films.This film deserves to be remembered as one of the better actioners of the nineties, not up there with Die Hard 2/3 or Speed, but better than 90% of the action junk made nowadays. At least this film has a plot."
The Wrestler,2008,7.9,"A faded professional wrestler must retire, but finds his quest for a new life outside the ring a dispiriting struggle.","If the phrase ""the little movie that could"" applies to any movie this year then it most certainly does to ""The Wrestler"". It is one of the best movies I've seen last year, and more than that it is even more special due to the brilliant and amazing performance of its cast.The return of Mickey Rourke was overdue, a gifted and talented actor, who in my opinion was wrongly shunned and marginalized because of his past attitude and behaviour which marked him as a ""bad boy"". Hollywood surely likes to sometimes punish its own, especially those individuals who don't repent and crawl on their knees asking for ""cinematic forgiveness"" from their peers. What happened to Mickey Rourke was pure hypocrisy on the part of an industry that has no problem tolerating much, much worse behaviour on the part of less talented individuals; an industry that from time to time seeks to attain some kind of superficial saving grace marked by a phony mea culpa and a symbolic sacrificial lamb, in this case Mickey Rourke. I ask, how is what he did any different than the behaviour of let's say Lindsay Lohan, whom many critics where at one point anointing her as the next Jody Foster or Merryl Streep?!?!? Talk about self-imposed blindness! When I last saw Rourke in ""Sin City"", I was, albeit briefly but forcefully reminded, of how good of an actor he really is. So imagine my pleasure and anticipation when ""The Wrestler"" came out! At heart this is a story of redemption, but here comes the kick, it is actually an attempt and ultimate failure at redemption, at least in the sense that redemption is understood in today's society. This is a profoundly sad movie, but that fact does not take away one bit from the movie, rather it makes it more believable and even more powerful.As Bruce Springsteen's song by the same title points out, there are some wrongs that can't be righted and some wounds that can't be mended, and that is the situation Mikey Rourke's character finds himself in. I don't want to discuss the movie in detail, nor give anything away from the plot or storyline, suffice to say that this is one viewing that is more than worth sitting through from beginning to end.Rourke, Marisa Tomei (another grossly underrated actress) and Evan Rachel Wood are phenomenal and really hold their own and make the most of their on-screen time. Whatever award nominations and wins these actors are likely to get are more than deserved. Darren Aronofsky has really grown by leaps and bounds in his solid and varied career as director. I am personally glad that he decided to helm this project, the end result speaks for itself.Ultimately there is redemption to be found in this movie, but it comes at a heavy price, to me that redemption takes the form of the triumph of the human spirit against insurmountable odds and seemingly impossible choices. These days that is a bold statement to make!"
Winter's Tale,2014,6.1,"A burglar falls for an heiress as she dies in his arms. When he learns that he has the gift of reincarnation, he sets out to save her.","I wanted to love this movie. Really, really wanted to. Winter's Tale is my favourite novel; but, I didn't want that to get in my way - I went in with an open mind. I knew that lots would have to be cut out (or else the movie would be 27 hours long!), and focusing on Peter Lake and Beverly Penn was obviously the right decision. BUT, then why would Akiva Goldsman ADD something? The totally ridiculous Judge/Devil character, played by Will Smith, is an invention that was very poorly chosen - it destroyed the magic. Parts of it were good: Colin Farrell is brilliant as Peter, Russell Crowe is a fiendishly wonderful Pearly Soames, and William Hurt is perfect as Isaac Penn; yet parts were bad. Although she is a great actor, Jessica Brown Findlay is woefully miscast as Beverly. Do yourself a favour, skip the movie, and instead go and read all of Mark Helprin's novels."
The Usual Suspects,1995,8.5,The sole survivor of a pier shoot-out tells the story of how a notorious criminal influenced the events that began with five criminals meeting in a seemingly random police lineup.,"Reviewers say 'The Usual Suspects' is acclaimed for its intricate plot, iconic twist, and masterful storytelling. Kevin Spacey's performance and the ensemble cast are praised for depth and believability. Themes of manipulation and betrayal are central, with Verbal Kint as a complex figure. Bryan Singer's direction and Christopher McQuarrie's screenplay are noted for precision and suspense. The atmospheric direction, sound design, and score enhance immersion. Despite criticisms of the convoluted plot and twist's impact on coherence, it is a seminal crime thriller."
The Secret Life of Pets,2016,6.5,"The quiet life of a terrier named Max is upended when his owner takes in Duke, a stray whom Max instantly dislikes.",Animated film that takes place in NYC. Two dogs named Max (voiced by Louis C.K.) and Duke (voiced by Eric Stonestreet) get separated from their owner when out for a walk. The film chronicles their journey back home.This is clearly aimed at kids but has plenty of humor that adults will enjoy. I'm in my 50s and laughed long and loud at some of the antics. The script is good and moves quickly. I was never bored. With one exception the voices perfectly fit the characters. The one exception was Snowball. He's a psychotic rabbit voiced by Kevin Hart. Hart can be funny but not here. He YELLS every word out at the audience. It gets annoying quick. The animation is great--very fluid and pleasing to the eye. The backdrops of NYC are breath-taking. The only real debit is there are some glaring lapses in logic but it IS a kids film. Recommended.
Fifty Shades of Black,2016,3.5,An inexperienced college student meets a wealthy businessman whose sexual practices put a strain on their relationship.,"You would think with all the accumulated earnings the Wayans brothers, Shawn and Marlon, have obtained after being on Television and in films for years that they would invest their money and their time in projects that would be a bit more thoughtful and entertaining. Instead, ever since the runaway success of ""A Haunted House"" in 2013, the two, particularly Marlon, have been keen on making movies that fit the bill for the lowest common denominator of entertainment. ""Fifty Shades of Black,"" a horribly obvious and persistently unfunny array of cheapshots at the erotic novel/film series that is already too easy to joke about, continues Marlon's streak and incredible failing to make something out of his Baby Way Productions company.I've always found it interesting that while Tyler Perry's films are anything but consistent, and there are about an equal number of bad films in his catalog as good films, he often gets blamed for making films about black people that cater to the lowest common denominator and showcase them in a negative light, yet the recent collaborations of Marlon Wayans and Michael Tiddes go pretty much unscathed. These are films that evoke some of the most putrid and ugly stereotypes about nearly every race and, for that matter, exist simply as unapologetically crude and contrived projects that do nothing but attempt to evoke laughs based on brand-recognition. These films are just a slight notch above the dreaded works of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer.As hinted, ""Fifty Shades of Black"" is a parody of ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" and it takes pretty much the safest, most convenient route to parody the film by making the jokes largely centered around the absurdity of BDSM and its culture, race and ethnic humor, the ordinariness and ""ugliness"" of its lead female character, and the enigma surrounding its titular character, who in this case, is Christian Black (Marlon Wayans). Christian is a multi-millionaire mogul who begins a sexual relationship with his new intern, Hannah Steale (Kali Hawk) and what entails is a relationship filled with sex, sexual violence, and downright bizarre encounters.While whatever Adam Sandler and his Happy Madison gang is cooking up this year is likely to get plenty of Razzie nominations, Marlon Wayans and his cast of familiar faces such as Affion Crockett, Missi Pyle, Mike Epps, Fred Willard, and more should be looking at the same award. It's incredibly rare to see a cast ostensibly operate on auto-pilot and look like the end product bearing some essence of quality is the furthest thing from their minds, but perhaps given the lazy screen writing of Rick Alvarez and Wayans himself, this was to be expected.Shockingly enough, ""Fifty Shades of Black"" offers more laughs than both of the ""Haunted House"" films put together, especially during a sequence that parodies one of last year's Best Picture contenders at the Academy Awards. However, in order to get to this sequence, one has to succumb to the drudgery of enough racial and bathroom humor - so much that it gives Laura Mulvey's concept of ""phallocentrism"" a whole different angle to explore - that it ultimately isn't worth sitting through the amount of trivial nonsense to get to that particular scene.We're not even in February yet and this year has already been incredibly interesting for comedies. After seeing ""Ride Along 2,"" I didn't think many more comedies of the year would get much worse than that. Then I saw ""Dirty Grandpa"" the following week and I thought the same thing; there was most likely the weakest comedy of 2016 that I would have to sit through. Now, almost exactly a week later, I've seen ""Fifty Shades of Black,"" and if this isn't the worst comedy of 2016, I seriously fear what I have to endure in the coming eleven months."
Leviathan,2014,7.6,"In a Russian coastal town, Kolya is forced to fight the corrupt mayor when he is told that his house will be demolished. He recruits a lawyer friend to help, but the man's arrival brings further misfortune for Kolya and his family.","Leviathan takes a long, immersive look at the machinations of corrupted power in the lives of the powerless, who desperately struggle to stay the course, hoping against hope to win a losing battle.A man and his family face off against a politically backed fat cat who wishes to buy the piece of land upon which stands their house, willing to destroy their family nest to raise a modern building in its stead. The grandiose, solemn music of Philip Glass (Akhnaten; Act I Prelude) opens and ends the movie, flanking it like a sturdy front and back cover a fine book from a Russian master's pen. Other than that, the movie is rather stark, musically and otherwise. It is remarkable how effective silent scenes can be. With little music and less sound effects, the film has your undivided attention, reaching emotional heights towards the end. The lack of a musical backdrop further enhances the gritty realism that imbues all the 140 minutes. Relationships between the characters evolve and change significantly over the span of the movie, and though the patterns are somewhat familiar, interpersonal developments are portrayed with commendable subtlety and brilliance. There is a lot of intelligence to the storytelling; much can be understood without words. We embark on a chilling journey into the land and home of ordinary, simple folks, who are kicking and screaming for justice under the suffocating oppression of ruthless power, also blighted by their own frailty.Leviathan is an outstanding work of art that manages to drive home universally relevant points with sparkling clarity in its refreshingly honest way. A highly recommended piece."
The Pacific,,8.3,"The Pacific Theatre of World War II, as seen through the eyes of several young Marines.","""The Pacific"" is Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg's epic 200 million dollar miniseries from the creators of the brilliant 2001 series ""Band Of Brothers'. Much like with Band Of Brothers, The Pacific gives us an unflinching look at the horrors of war, not just the physical but the mental horrors these men must face. As an audience you are pulled through this experience, watching in horror as limbs are torn from bodies and men are burned and mutilated. In a way even more distressing is watching the emotional scars and effects this has on our main characters. This is not a perfect series and does suffer from some major flaws but overall it's an extremely harrowing experience but one that is needed in an age where war is often glorified, this series does anything but that.Narrative and overall story: The Pacific is based primarily on two memoirs of U.S. Marines, With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa by Eugene Sledge and Helmet for My Pillow by Robert Leckie. The miniseries follows both these marines Sledge (played by joe mazzello) and Leckie (James Badge Dale) there is also the addition of marine John Basilone (Jon Seda) but he is a lesser focus. Now unlike Band of Brothers we follow these characters separately as they are part of different divisions, the first few episodes follow Leckie and his experiences, the latter on Sledge. In a way this is both an interesting way of narration but also maybe the biggest flaw of the series.This spilt narration gives us two very separate journeys which in a way bonds us closer to the characters. The downfall is that Leckie's story is just simply not as interesting as Sledges, from the moment Sledge is introduced to us i felt an instant sympathy and connection with him, here is this shy, awkward eighteen year old desperately longing to fight in the war but unable to do so thanks to a heart mummer, of course his determination gets the best of him and enlists. The character and his overall story is simply miles more compelling than Leckie's thats what makes the first three or four episodes somewhat lackluster. When the sole focus is on Sledge this series reaches its incredible potential and becomes something truly amazing, Sledge and his journey is really the heart and soul of this series.Acting: With such a depressing and intense subject matter first class acting was expected and the pacific delivers. Every single cast member gives a great performance, its gripping and believable acting at its best. The stars are undoubtedly Joe Mazzello who plays Sledge and Rami Malek who plays Corporal Merriell Shelton or ""Snafu"", a highly intriguing character who forms a close friendship with Sledge. Both give Emmy worthy performances and in Malek's case i would say Oscar worthy. These are two very complex and incredible performances. Mazzello plays our lead which such an intense and subtle power: his character goes from a naive and passive teenager to hardened killing machine full of rage it is an incredible character arc and Mazzello plays it to perfection. As the series comes to a close we really see what Mazzello can do: Sledge is beginning to lose himself, he has become ruthless and in one single pivotal scene he regains his humanity, his compassion and his redemption. Its a truly powerful scene and one in which Mazzello does not utter one word, his face says everything and its heartbreaking. In fact that is Mazzello main strong point, his ability to convey much more than what is going on just by his eyes and face, there is so much complex emotion behind his eyes it makes for a fascinating watch. Rami Malek gives the most impressive performance of the series playing ""Snafu"". His character is incredibly creepy and odd, obviously numbed by the horrors of the war, but there is something there that makes the audience warm to him. Malek completely becomes the role, every mannerism, twitch, blink of the eye is perfectly done. lines such as ""I like to watch the new guys sweat."" are said with such odd intensity its actually mind blowing. I will call this performance perfect which is a very rare thing indeed, if only Malek could win an Oscar because this performance truly deserves the highest acclaim. Malek and Mozzello also have fantastic chemistry, playing off each other perfectly helping to only further this touching friendship.Direction: remember the opening sequence of ""Saving Private Ryan""? well imagine that times 20. I would say this is the most realistic portrayal of what an actual battle must have felt like. The battle scenes are simply epic and wonderfully directed, even if you hate everything else anyone can see the direction is incredible within this series.Overall: the major flaw of this series if the first 4 episodes they simply don't have the emotional impact of the rest, in fact they border on dull. However as soon as Sledge and Snafu become our main focus this series becomes a true epic. This series will take you on a haunting experience, you will be horrified, you will be moved, you will laugh, you will cry. As long as you stick with it through the first few episodes you will not regret it."
Now You See Me 2,2016,6.4,"The Four Horsemen resurface, and are forcibly recruited by a tech genius to pull off their most impossible heist yet.","As a film this really is poor. On practically every level it falls down¬Ö Now You See Me 2 picks up directly where the first film left off and the film follows a similar pattern ‚Äì The 4 (or 5?) horsemen, performing larger-than-life magic with the aim of providing for those less fortunate or exposing those who do wrong. However, unlike the first, their motivations behind each of these stunts are a little less clear and certainly less meaningful. In fact inconsistent or unlikely character motivations and actions are a problem throughout the film (with supporting characters as well as the leads).Then there's the fact that this plot is so unrealistic and beyond the realms of possibility that it makes the first script look practically normal. The script in itself is a problem¬Ö it's messy, incongruent and forced ‚Äì ""well we need to have a shootout/car chase, otherwise it won't be cool enough"".Then there's the fact that Isla Fisher's character has left the gang and although briefly explained at the beginning of the film, is never mentioned again. Yet her replacement (played by Lizzy Caplan) is not only treated as if she's been there since the beginning, but also held responsible for all the actions she wasn't around for in the first film. I get the feeling it might have been easier for her just to play Isla Fisher's character (Katie Holmes-Maggie Gyllenhaal in Batman style) rather than trying to shoehorn in a different character. And talking of characters ‚Äì Daniel Radcliffe's character is atrocious. I don't want to give anything away but he is such a stereotypical, spoilt, British man it's untrue. Moreover his acting in this was reminiscent of all his appalling, wooden performances from the early Harry Potter films¬Ö And just I was starting to believe that maybe he could act!And then there are issues around plot holes, speech which is purely for the viewers' benefit, seemingly irrelevant sub-plots and a ridiculously backwards ending which doesn't appear to make much sense.So how the hell, given all these problems, does it give it get a 6 I hear you cry? Well, as with the first, it is still thoroughly entertaining. It's light-hearted fun, which isn't really tackling any of the world's serious topics and as a spectacle is still great. Sure I found myself thinking of several occasions 'my god this is garbage', but it didn't annoy me. It's the kind of film where you can laugh off the issues and appreciate the fun parts.In summary, if you liked the first one, I certainly wouldn't discourage you from seeing NYSM2. I'd just go in with limited expectations and an acceptance that many aspects of it aren't going to be very good. If you have those two things you'll probably enjoy it thoroughly, despite all its flaws."
Band of Brothers,,9.4,"The story of Easy Company of the U.S. Army 101st Airborne Division and their mission in World War II Europe, from Operation Overlord to V-J Day.","Reviewers say 'Band of Brothers' is acclaimed for its realistic World War II portrayal, deep character development, and emotional depth. The series is praised for historical accuracy, attention to detail, and powerful depiction of war's psychological toll. Themes of camaraderie and human cost are central. However, some find pacing slow and character introductions confusing. Certain episodes feel less engaging or repetitive. Despite criticisms, it is widely regarded as a monumental television achievement, offering a profound war drama experience."
Battle of the Bulge,1965,6.8,A dramatization of Nazi Germany's final Western Front counterattack of World War II.,"Let's pretend this movie has nothing to do with the battle in Belgium, winter 1944. The movie is only bad if you associate it too much with the real life events, but if you focus on the amazing line-up of actors, special effects, soundtrack, and battle sequences, it becomes a very interesting and entertaining World War II movie. Although compared to more realistic war movies like Patton, this film serves no real educational value. To me it seems like a WWII fan-fiction of some sort, like a ""what-if"" scenario. The movie would have probably been ridiculed a lot less if it was titled something different (anything but The Battle of the Bulge), therefore people would just assume it's some sort of war sci-fi movie.Don't let the title fool you; There's only a few things in the whole movie which actually relate to the Ardennes 1944 (i.e., the snow battles, unexpected German spearheads, General McAuliffe & the ""nuts"" letter, locations in Malmedy, etc.), meanwhile there's no mention of Patton's relief of Bastogne, which was the the event most people associate with the real battle of the bulge in the first place.Check this movie out if you'd like to see something different from factual movies. It's a small break from reality, and portrayed in a seemingly fictional (but real, technically) campaign in WWII. It's also a great movie if you like all-star casts and A list actors."
The Road to Wellville,1994,5.9,"A story about the ins and outs of one unusual health facility in the early twentieth century, run by the eccentric Dr. John Harvey Kellogg.","At the time of the release of ""The Road to Wellville,"" I was the opinion page editor for the Battle Creek, Michigan, newspaper.  I also had written a history of the life of work of Will K. Kellogg, founder of Kellogg Co. and brother of the film's hero, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg (played by Anthony Hopkins).   I had read and published a review of T.C. Boyle's novel (which I enjoyed, but questioned for its historical inaccuracies).  So I suppose I was a natural to be asked by the newspaper and to review the film.  As a result, I was in the front row of an audience of Battle Creek residents during the ""Michigan premiere"" of the movie.  To put it mildly, the audience was at times shocked and bemused, but overall they were pretty entertained. The most blatant fictions that should be corrected are that the old Battle Creek Sanitarium was *not* a coed facility, that female nurses *never* gave enemas to male guests (or males to females, for that matter), that Dr. Kellogg did *not* die while diving in his 70s (he was 91 and died in bed), and that George Kellogg -- a very real human being -- was *not* a wayward drunk.  In fact, the only blatantly factual material is stated in the first five minutes, and then the film becomes fiction.  Much is changed from the original novel (particularly how Dr. Kellogg deals with George), and the serio-comic tone of the novel is transformed into stupid, juvenile titillation over bodily fluids and sexual escapades. However, the movie *does* capture the mood and atmosphere of Battle Creek in the first few years of the 20th century -- the charlatans, the fly-by-nights and the ne'er-do-wells are shown for pretty much what they were.  The faddists who took advantage of sincere Seventh-day Adventist health doctrine are extremely well depicted, as are there gullible ""patients.""  And -- despite the phony rabbit teeth -- Hopkins is awfully fun as Dr. Kellogg.  The satire is well-taken and in many ways successful. Overall, I recommend reading Boyle's novel over seeing this film, but I also recommend reading a serious history of the cereal industry and its antecedents before believing a word of the fictional creations in both the movie and the novel. If you want to watch a great Parker film, rent ""Pink Floyd The Wall"" and skip this one.  But if you want to get a feel for Anthony Hopkins' incredible acting range, this is worth seeing.  Not for much else, though!"
Boys Don't Cry,1999,7.5,"A young transgender man named Brandon navigates love, life, and trying to pass as a boy in rural Nebraska.","This is a very powerful, and in many ways very disturbing, film that ultimately lingers with me not for its sensational subject matter but for its tragic and rewarding love story.  Here we have two troubled strangers, both horribly at odds with their surroundings, finding each other, falling in love despite the many factors against them, and finally becoming the victims of the perception of their love.  Like many others, I was tremendously impressed by the performance of Hilary Swank  but I think the glue that holds the film together and gives it amazing hope and humanity is Chloe Sevigny.  She takes a role that could have easily fallen apart in a lesser actress's hands and gives it complexity and depth that goes well beyond the script. To watch her  is a breathtaking journey. Watch the way she uses her face in this movie ¬ñ this is an actress of remarkable expressiveness and skill! Overall, it is a very fine film that merits any serious moviegoer's rapt attention."
22 Jump Street,2014,7.0,"After making their way through high school (twice), big changes are in store for officers Schmidt and Jenko when they go deep undercover at a local college.","If there's one criticism I have about 22 Jump Street, it's that the movie feels too similar to 21 Jump Street. But is that really a complaint? With 22 Jump Street, directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller (The LEGO Movie) have created a massively entertaining ride, with more antics from the characters we love, and better performances all around.This time around, they're going to college. Yeah, yeah, we've heard it before. As Ice Cube says at the end of the first film, in which the two went undercover at a high school, the tables have been turned and they're going to college now. Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) must once again go undercover at MC State to bust another drug operation, this time called WHYPHY (work hard? yes. play hard? yes.)What worked with 21 Jump Street works again in 22 Jump Street. The excellent characters of Schmidt and Jenko are once again paired to make a hilarious and charismatic duo. Their personalities clash once more, but in a different way than the first film, and they get into even more crazy shenanigans than before. This includes having a shootout in the university library and busting a Spring Break beach party. 22 Jump Street always keeps you on edge, wondering what will happen next. While the plot is pretty standard and similar to the first film, you'll want to stick around because you love these characters so much. New characters such as Zook (Wyatt Russell) and Mercedes (Jillian Bell) feel right at home within the crazy cast. Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) is also in rare form, delivering some of the film's best moments.This is a testament to Hill and Tatum, who put so much work into creating these characters. Jenko settles into the football team, and makes friends at a fraternity, while Schmidt performs slam poetry and does many walks of shame. Hill and Tatum are in top form. Their chemistry is better than ever, making 22 Jump Street a hilarious buddy comedy. Try not to laugh when Schmidt does slam poetry to impress a girl, I dare you.What makes 22 Jump Street feel special is its self-referential attitude and countless meta jokes. Police chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) essentially explains why this movie was made within the first 10 minutes, saying ""no one cared about the Jump Street reboot, but you guys got lucky."" It's a funny way to be self-deprecating and hilarious at the same time. It plays to the audience's intelligence, rather than making them feel stupid. Other references are more subtle, like when Schmidt keeps asking about the film's budget. It all plays into a very interesting and unique humor style. While there are plenty of raunchy jokes (right in the crack), the film's best come from its self-referencing.So, now for the all-important question: is 22 Jump Street better than the original? With its meta jokes and its excellent characterization, 22 Jump Street is a rousing success, and matches the original in sheer humor. But the plot feels too similar to the original. While this may be a fault in the film's format, a few more twists would have been appreciated. Still, 22 Jump Street is a hilarious ride, one definitely worth taking."
Sal√≤ o le 120 giornate di Sodoma,1975,5.8,"In World War II Italy, four fascist libertines round up nine adolescent boys and girls and subject them to 120 days of torture.","Reviewers say 'Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom' is a controversial film exploring power, corruption, and depravity. Based on de Sade's work, it depicts extreme abuse by fascists. Many find it disturbing yet artistically significant, while others criticize its graphic content and slow pace. Its examination of fascism and power abuse is noted, sparking debates on its artistic and moral value."
Me Before You,2016,7.4,A girl in a small town forms an unlikely bond with a recently-paralyzed man she's taking care of.,"I loved this movie. It stayed very true to the book and I love the book. I think Emilia Clarke was born to play her. I feel like she was just playing herself cause she has a personality like that in real life. It was pure joy to watch her play Lou. The expressions she makes, the way she talks and most of all, her amazing clothes! I loved every single outfit she wore. This film made me laugh and it made me very emotional, just like the book. I think Sam Claflin was also born to play Will. They had an amazing chemistry throughout the entire film and the rest of the cast is also spot on. There are of course some parts from the book that were left out but nonetheless, this film was still amazing. I also want to point out that the soundtrack of the movie is amazing as well."
Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates,2016,6.0,"Two hard-partying brothers place an online ad to find the perfect dates for their sister's Hawaiian wedding. Hoping for a wild getaway, the boys instead find themselves out-hustled by an uncontrollable duo.","'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates' had some promise when the trailers first came out. I honestly believed this film would capture the tone of the first 'Hangover' movie, but something went wrong early on.1. I know this film was based on true events, and I guarantee the true events would have been far more entertaining than the ones depicted in this film. For he most part, the movie has a strong opening where we see how these two brothers party, but we also witness the aftermath of their wild antics. Things move well enough till we get to the point where they actually end up on Hawaii. At this point, things take a tumble off a cliff.2. Mike and Dave and played by Adam Devine and Zac Efron respectively. These two make an okay pair as brothers, but Adam Devine (especially) pushes the limit. Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick are probably the worst additions to the cast, cause they are terribly unfunny. You would assume both Devine and Plaza would bring a certain level of comedy and timing, but they unfortunately don't and the jokes are misplaced.3. I'm not saying the movie is completely unfunny, but the most you get are a few chuckles here and there. Efron and Kendrick are better actors to star in a film like this, frankly this is below their standards. This should have been a direct to TV or DVD movie which featured some unknown/up-and-coming actors instead of bigger names filling the void. The side characters are annoying as f#%k, which in turn lowers the bar on the comedy.The movie fails to redeem itself and it's only passable as maybe a rental. No one should waste their time and especially money on going to the cinema to watch this."
Bridesmaids,2011,6.8,"Competition between the maid of honor and a bridesmaid, over who is the bride's best friend, threatens to upend the life of an out-of-work pastry chef.","This flick is silly, funny, bitchy, and just great. We meet Annie (Kristen Wiig) a bridesmaid, whose best friend is getting married. Annie has lost her business and is alone and loveless. She is also getting pushed out of her bestie relationship by the NEW broad, the NEW bridesmaid, who is gorgeous, rich, and generous. How dare she? Then Annie loses her apartment and has to move back in with mommy (Jill Clayburgh). This is a hilarious chick flick of high caliber. The women are funny, clever and outrageous. The fashions are just silly enough and the writing and acting carry it off smoothly. There isn't a miss in the bunch but Melissa McCarthy stole plenty of the show."
Youth,2015,7.3,Retired orchestra conductor Fred Ballinger is on vacation with his daughter Lena and his film director best friend Mick Boyle in the Alps when he receives an invitation from Queen Elizabeth II to perform for Prince Philip's birthday.,"What a Beautiful Film, i Think it's too late to say This one it's a must See, Don't Mind The Negative Reviews."
Bad Moms,2016,6.2,"When three overworked and under-appreciated moms are pushed beyond their limits, they ditch their conventional responsibilities for a jolt of long overdue freedom, fun and comedic self-indulgence.","In your own head you are not only supermom you are also a martyr that would sacrifice everything for your family.You are ridiculously hot, you do everything at home and at work (literally) and without you the world would come crumbling down, yet you are under appreciated and treated like dirt.All in 6 inch heels, flawless make-up and not a hair out of place...The movie is what Hollywood thinks soccormoms fantasy themselves as. They would break away from their roles and be ""bad girls"" for a day and that would bring balance back to the force.I didn't mind the clich√© however the humor here is really either hit or miss. You'll either stare in silence at the screen going ""what? was that supposed to be a joke? It looked painful/offensive/silly"" then there are the jokes that land and those are really funny in comparison... they don't happen often enough to cover for the bad jokes though.Harmless enough of a movie if there is nothing else on but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it."
The Accountant,2016,7.3,"As a math savant uncooks the books for a new client, the Treasury Department closes in on his activities, and the body count starts to rise.","Reviewers say 'The Accountant' is lauded for Ben Affleck's compelling performance and thrilling action scenes. The film's mix of thriller and drama offers a unique take on the action hero. However, the plot is criticized for being convoluted and hard to follow. Mixed reactions exist towards supporting characters and subplots, though the ensemble cast and portrayal of autism are appreciated."
Suicide Squad,2016,5.9,A secret government agency recruits some of the most dangerous incarcerated super-villains to form a defensive task force. Their first mission: save the world from the apocalypse.,"Is this movie terrible? Absolutely notIs this movie great? Absolutely not.I always heard from people that they either HATED or LOVED this movie. And for me it was neither.The audience for this film is served with a classic action movie/comic book. ""The world is in danger! There must be a solution! Although there are bumps between the characters along the way, eventually, we'll solve the problem""The interesting twist is *supposed* to be that instead of classic superheroes, we have bad guys. To that I say ""so what?"". The movie didn't really establish why I should care about much of what was going on on screen‚Äîit was all just classic popcorn movie action and sequences that were occasionally broken up by half-attempts at character development."
Star Trek: Beyond,2016,7.0,"The crew of the USS Enterprise explores the furthest reaches of uncharted space, where they encounter a new ruthless enemy, who puts them, and everything the Federation stands for, to the test.","OK, so I'm a Star Trek fan being old enough to have watched the original series BEFORE it was in re-runs! But Star Trek Beyond just plain disappoints. It's not terrible¬Ö but it's not great either.It's Star Date 2263.2 and Kirk (Chris Pine) is into the third year of their ""5 year mission"" (which seems to somehow throw away a lot of potential sequel opportunities already doesn't it?). Less buoyant and confident than he used to be, Kirk is feeling a little emotionally 'Lost in Space': after all, as the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy put it ""Space is big¬Ö REALLY big"". Spock (Zachary Quinto) also receives some news of a personal nature that unsettles him. They are both in need of a vacation, and Starbase Yorktown (queue some spectacular special effects and an operatic Michael Giacchino track) appears to be able to offer them that. The crew disperse for a bit of R and R: Sulu (John Cho) goes off to spend time with his family (after the big internet furore, the gay aspect of this is very subtle); Kirk gets career advice from the Admiral; and Spock and Uhuru (Zoe Saldana) go their separate ways since ‚Äì like Ross and Rachael ‚Äì they are ""on a break"".The reverie is rudely interrupted by the arrival of a frantic alien called Kalara (Lydia Wilson) from the other side of a dense nebula. She needs help to rescue her crew, stranded on a planet there. Kirk's rescue mission however goes far from to-plan, and he and his crew are caught in the clutches of the warlord Krall (Idris Elba).What's nice about this film is that the core crew of Kirk, Spock, Uhuru, Bones (Karl Urban), Scotty (Simon Pegg), Sulu and Chekov (the tragically departed Anton Yelchin) gel together really nicely as an ensemble cast. The traditional by-play between the characters feels unforced, comedic and provides a warmth at the heart of the film. There is also a touching tribute to Leonard Nimoy, who died while the film was in pre-production, woven into the story of which I'm sure he would have approved.Supporting the crew as a potential new character is the strikingly attractive and kick-ass Jaylah played by Sofia Boutella (the evil amputee Gazelle from ""Kingsman"").There's also some fine and innovative alien technology on display with the 'swarm-like' alien fleet harking back (in an expanded scale) to the invulnerability of the nanites from an original episode.Unfortunately, all of these positives are severely offset by a largely planet-bound Simon Pegg and Doug Jung story (didn't the woeful ""Insurrection"" teach writers that this tends not to be a good idea?) and action sequences that are so manically fast-moving that it is almost impossible to keep track of what exactly is happening. (Perversely, this is a film that might actually make more sense on the small screen than the big one, which is just BAD CINEMA!). There was even one point in a final fight scene where I seriously feared Kirk and Krall might have a 'sharing of mother's names' moment (if you know what I mean) but fortunately this script apocalypse is avoided.At the conclusion the story actually makes no sense to me at all: without spoilers, it is difficult to discern exactly what the motivations of Krall actually were. Throw in a graphic in the final reel that looks like Krall is attacking the Death Star (no, seriously ‚Äì watch for it!) and the concoction just doesn't hang together very well. I know Simon Pegg and director Justin (""Fast and Furious"") Lin are huge Trekkers, but ‚Äì sorry guys ‚Äì this was a C- for me.It's a mildly diverting popcorn movie, but with (for me at least) yet another disappointing film, its getting to the point where the best 'summer blockbuster' is likely to be Deadpool¬Ö and that was released in February!(Please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

Jason Bourne,2016,6.6,The CIA's most dangerous former operative is drawn out of hiding to uncover more explosive truths about his past.,"The original Bourne trilogy of Identity, Supremacy and Ultimatum were brilliant displays in effective storytelling and great action. Jason Bourne, however, isn't quite as proficient in both of those areas. On the one hand, it's action-packed to the brim, and provides for a hugely entertaining watch, but on the other, it's a disappointment as far as bringing yet another intriguing and truly thrilling mystery to life is concerned.Let's start on the bright side, however, with the action. Paul Greengrass does yet another sterling job at directing some hugely exciting action sequences (including a thrilling chase in Athens that harks back to Ultimatum's Tangier chase), and in tandem with yet another excellent performance by Matt Damon as Jason Bourne himself, the action is definitely the best part of this film.Where the story lacks, Jason Bourne more often than not gives you some insane action to revel at. Sure, it's not the work of storytelling geniuses, but if you're the sort of person who can turn their brain off for two hours and watch wall-to-wall action and explosions, then this film will have you in dreamland. It's not a Michael Bay movie, and Greengrass' style lends a lot to making more vibrant action sequences, but there's no doubt that fans of big action will love this film.On the whole, I did enjoy this film, and I was able to recognise its flaws and just watch it as a big blockbuster. However, I can't escape feeling disappointed at the film's total failure to tell as intriguing a story as the first three films in the series.The enthralling mysteries and gradual revelations about Jason Bourne's past were what really separated this series from any other spy thriller. In this movie, however, everything felt a lot more generic, with a much bigger emphasis on action than clever storytelling and patient, gradual character and plot development. Unfortunately, it's that that makes Jason Bourne look pale in comparison to the original trilogy, and those who are expecting yet another engrossing and intelligent thriller will certainly be disappointed.That said, there are bright moments in the story too. It's not a horrifically dull film, and there are a few details that relate right the way back to The Bourne Identity. What's more is that Matt Damon, Alicia Vikander and Tommy Lee Jones all put in very strong performances to add a degree of gravitas to what is in truth a very clich√©d and repetitive story, which was good to see.Overall, I am disappointed by Jason Bourne, in that it doesn't manage to tell such an enthralling and intelligent mystery as the series' original trilogy, but its top-quality action and strong directing and performances still allowed me to have a lot of fun for two hours."
The Girl on the Train,2016,6.5,A divorcee becomes entangled in a missing persons investigation that promises to send shockwaves throughout her life.,"I watched this straight after the book and I think reading the book first was a big mistake (the book was brilliant!). They cut out so many parts of the book which made their personality traits believable and to understand why they were the way they were and actually feel empathy for the characters. I think the film wouldn't have been such a disappointment for me if the book wasn't such a page turner, so if you've already read the book - don't bother with this film."
Sully,2016,7.4,"When pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger lands his damaged plane on the Hudson River in order to save the flight's passengers and crew, some consider him a hero while others think he was reckless.","If there's one thing you can count on Clint Eastwood doing well, it's directing an emotionally heartfelt story. Sully continues Eastwood's success by giving us probably the most human drama of 2016.""The miracle on the Hudson"" is the subject of this Eastwood drama, starring Tom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart, and Laura Linney. There will be plenty of obstacles with any film based on a true story, but with a film based on an event that lasted a mere 208 seconds, it's extra difficult. But Eastwood manages to pull a great story out of these unbelievable events that comes in just under 2 hours. Of course, the flight itself isn't the only hurdle that captain Sully went through, as he dealt with reporters, investigators, and the National Transportation Safety Board determined to diminish his heroic efforts.Who could possibly be better to play Captain Sully than the great Tom Hanks. Having wonderfully played another ""controversial"" captain back in 2013 as Captain Phillips, there was no doubt he could pull off a somewhat similar role. Boy does Hanks deliver. He always effortlessly pulls out the big speeches and powerful dialogue well, but I often find his more subtle acting to be more impressive. It's the moments when Sully is reacting to the big moments with only his facial expressions and body languages that give me goosebumps. Not many actors are able to bring me to the verge of tears just by a facial expression, but Hanks is one of them.Eastwood and his editors also deserve tons of credit for their work here. Much like Hanks' subtle acting, I love when Eastwood holds back the bombastic music (that can sometimes take you out of a story like this) and lets the audience choose how to feel by watching gorgeous cinematography and poignant acting and directing. This may be Eastwood's best directorial work since Million Dollar Baby. He understood exactly the moments to use and not music in order to pull the emotion out of his audience.Most of all, this film is a great display of the power of the human spirit. Everything about this film is grounded with humanity. No one seems fake. So often Hollywood is flooded with over-the-top filmmaking that can easily dilute the power of the film's message. Sully knows exactly what it's going for, and it does it to near perfection.+Eastwood back at the top+Hanks subtle acting+Power of human spirit91/100"
Get Smart,2008,6.5,"Maxwell Smart, a highly intellectual but bumbling spy working for the CONTROL agency, is tasked with preventing a terrorist attack from rival spy agency KAOS.","I enjoyed every minute of Get Smart. It's an agreeable and fun mixture of the action, spy, and comedy genres. Imagine a combination of Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Pineapple Express, with some Steve Carell-style comedy mixed in. It's not similar in story to either of those movies, but it does manage to blend action and comedy together in a comparable way.The casting is perfect, and really what makes Get Smart so likable. There is a pretty amazing group of actors gathered here, especially considering the fact that these kinds of films do not often attract A-list talent. Everyone seemed like they were having fun and enjoying their roles, and it shows in their acting.Get Smart has a basic spy-type plot that certainly won't be winning any awards for originality. At the same time, I never though the fairly typical story was detracting from the movie. You're probably not watching this for a deep and thought-provoking experience, anyway.And who would have guessed that Anne Hathaway would be so good in an action role? I'd love to see her do more of this kind of thing in the future, she has a bit of a talent for it."
Sausage Party,2016,6.1,A sausage leads a group of supermarket products on a journey to discover the truth about their existence and what really happens when they are picked off the shelf.,"Sausage Party, the latest button-pusher from Seth Rogen and his usual crew, has so far grossed $135 million on a $19 million budget, receiving mainly positive reviews from critics and assisted by strong word-of-mouth thanks to a climactic scene which won't allow you to look at a hot dog in quite the same way again. Essentially a movie about anthropomorphic, sexually repressed food items who long to escape the confines of their supermarket home to reach the 'Great Beyond' - taken home by us humans - Sausage Party is a mixed bag. On one hand, it's a bold religious parable featuring some extremely creative animation, but on the other, at least comedy wise, this is on par with some of Rogen's most mediocre output.In a supermarket named Shopwell's, the various tasty treats that line the shelves spend their days praying they will be picked and taken to the great unknown by shoppers, who they view as gods. Each morning starts with a sing-a-long, and they try to live their life by a set of rules they believe will led to them being chosen, including no sex until they're out of their packet. Hot dog Frank (Rogen) only allows himself to touch tips with the bun he's in love with, Brenda (Kristen Wiig), saving themselves for the inevitable day when they get carried off into paradise. But with the return of Honey Mustard (Danny McBride), who claims that he witnessed torture and horror at the hands of the 'gods' who devoured some of his friends, Frank sets off on a journey of discovery and awakening.Similar in many ways to Pixar's Toy Story trilogy, Sausage Party imagines what it would be like if the food we consume to eagerly could talk to each other and wonders what they would make of us. But while Woody and co. would flop to the ground whenever a human walked in the room, the characters here exist in the 'fourth dimension', unseen by humans. This allows more freedom for directors Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon to deliver as many outlandish set pieces as they would like, and two scenes in particular - one inspired by Saving Private Ryan (1998) and the other featuring an Irish potato being skinned alive while his friends watch - are actually quite terrifying. The film is certainly at its best during these moments, and there are scenes of real ingenuity amongst the carnage.The first half whizzes by and is a blast, but then the film seems to lose direction and wander aimlessly from one scene to another. It also struggles to tickle the funny bone, and relies too heavily on tired food puns, familiar shtick from the likes of James Franco, Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Paul Rudd and Bill Hader, and outright vulgarity. Someone should point out to the writers - which include Rogen and regular collaborator Evan Goldberg - that using ""f**k"" every other word doesn't automatically make a film 'adult', but quickly becomes unpleasant and completely unnecessary, especially when the characters are otherwise perfectly likable. Also, the inclusion of Douche (Nick Kroll), the cavity-cleaner who holds a grudge against Frank, serves only a distraction from the more interesting central plot.Still, despite its many flaws and irritating tics, I very much enjoyed Sausage Party for what it is, and it's like nothing I've ever seen before. If you haven't enjoyed much of Rogen's previous output, chances are you won't love Sausage Party, although there's plenty of visual splendour to savour in between the d**k jokes. At its best, it offers interesting parallels to real-world issues, such as the relationship between a lavash named Kareem (David Krumholtz) and a bagel named Sammy (Edward Norton doing a pitch-perfect Woody Allen impression), and their bickering over shelf space. Of course, this is the edible version of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and while it may embrace comedic stereotyping throughout, Sausage Party never intends to offend, and instead offers a surprisingly sympathetic message about the necessity of religion. Whatever your view, the fact that a film like this can be greenlit and unleashed on a mainstream audience is cause for celebration."
Masterminds,2015,5.8,A guard at an armored car company in the Southern U.S. organizes one of the biggest bank heists in American history.,"Jared Hess (the director) is someone who doesn't believe in the usual comedic mould.His vision of comedy is obscure in that he doesn't want us to laugh at the obvious slapstick.He wants us to cringe a little at the truth behind his laughs.While it's true that in the end comedies need to make us guffaw, chuckle, snicker, titter and chortle; the real art of comedy is to make us feel the pain of our protagonist.I think in this regard, Jared Hess has achieved something rare.A comedic protagonist who is very real and flawed and sad.His sadness makes us laugh because of how bleak his existence is.We feel for him and wish him all the best. I feel that people who don't get this movie are afraid of humanness in others.That's why people are idiots. Because they see comedies as an excuse to simply laugh mindlessly at absurd plot lines. Comedies are also commentaries on the human condition. In spite of being marketed as slapstick, Masterminds is a film about a fragile soul in a dangerous world. Since making such a film a drama would turn away crowds in droves, the film maker re-framed it as something of a tragic comedy.My heart felt for this hero who is at once self-deluded and incredibly sensitive.If you have ever understood unconditional love, you might find something to love in Masterminds too."
Snowden,2016,7.3,"The NSA's illegal surveillance techniques are leaked to the public by one of the agency's employees, Edward Snowden, in the form of thousands of classified documents distributed to the press.","For those who don't like documentaries (the documentary about Snowden, which is part of this movie, is excellent education about what our government can do with us) watch this first. Oliver Stone paints a portrait of a stand-up, pretty much button down guy who realizes the work he falls into is anything but what he was taught was right -- and then he needs to find a way out, without endangering his girlfriend. Another great film about a whistleblower --- and for his whistleblowing, he faces far harsher penalties just for coming home. Oliver Stone delivers thought provoking film again, and the entire cast, as well as the writing, is stellar.For those who made up their mind about Ed Snowden through what was reported in mass media, I would simply say, watch this with an open mind. What happened to him could happen to any of us. This is a cautionary tale based on true facts told in the most exquisite way by Stone and his cast.Isabeau Vollhardt, author, The Casebook of Elisha Grey"
The BFG,2016,6.3,"An orphan little girl befriends a benevolent giant who takes her to Giant Country, where they attempt to stop the man-eating giants that are invading the human world.","I'm also quite surprised by all the negativity thrown at this film. Yes, it does have its slow spots and could certainly use better editing, but it can be quite wondrous, humorous, and has some important messages to relay as well.I thought the scenes with the Queen (Penelope Wilton) were highly imaginative, funny, and warm-hearted. Both Mark Rylance and young Ruby Barnhill were excellent in their lead roles.As others have noted, this is not the best Spielberg film ever, but perhaps over time it will gain more favor. The late Melissa Mathis wrote the screenplay, as she did for Spielberg's classic ""E.T."". It's based, of course, on the great Roald Dahl book.All in all, I agree with those that don't think this movie deserves the pummeling it's getting, and I feel there's lots to like here, for those that want to give it a chance."
Nerve,2016,6.5,"A high school senior finds herself immersed in an online game of truth or dare, becoming a 'player' of the game, where her every move is manipulated by an anonymous community of 'watchers.'","This was a movie that I thought had a very cool premise, but at the same time, its trailer appeared to leave no surprises to be discovered.The Good This film's premise is definitely a fun one, and at the least, this movie was almost constantly entertaining. The dares that these people are forced to do as well as the reasons for why people are playing this game are things I found very fun and interesting.Emma Roberts and Dave Franco both give solid performances in this film, and they each work well off of each other. Roberts as Vee accurately depicts a high school senior struggling with social problems as well as college, even if Roberts herself looks like she graduated from high school six years ago. Franco's character was also an intriguing one, and he grew on me the more the film progressed.I enjoyed nearly every moment when a legitimate dare was being done, as they were handled very well and created tension excellently. The style of this movie is also a reason as to why this film feels original, as the sleek visuals create some very cool scenes.The Bad Nerve can be very fun when it wants to be, but the problem is that it also takes itself way too seriously in many scenes. This movie tries to get serious towards the end and become dramatic and have important themes, but it all comes across as incredibly dull and tedious.Speaking of the ending, no matter how serious the movie thinks it is, it is absolutely stupid. The whole plan doesn't make much sense at all, and there are way too many unanswerable questions to just let go how convoluted it is.While I did like Roberts and Franco, I had a massive problem with Emily Meade.Whether it is the design of her character or the performance, Meade is completely unlikable and lacks any sense at all, and that would be okay if we are supposed to be against her. Instead, the movie expects us to feel sorry for her, which I found impossible to do.My biggest fear coming in was that the trailer gave away too much of the main plot.I wouldn't say the trailer gave away too much, I would say the trailer gave away everything. Every single scene, besides two, in particular, I saw coming a mile away because of one individual trailer, and I think it completely ruined my film going experience. Nearly every dare, every important conflict, and even the plot twist can be found within this movie's official trailer, and I highly recommend avoiding that trailer like the plague if you have any interest in seeing this movie.Conclusion Nerve has good performances from its two leads and a unique visual style, and it certainly has its fair share of entertainment. However, though it might not be fair, the trailer absolutely ruined my experience by giving away the vast majority of the plot. Even besides that, there are issues in the film's storytelling, and whenever the movie tries to be taken seriously, it falls flat on its face. Nerve has its moments but falls apart towards its conclusion.4.5/10"
Woman in Gold,2015,7.3,"Maria Altmann, an octogenarian Jewish refugee, takes on the Austrian government to recover artwork she believes rightfully belongs to her family.","Greetings again from the darkness. The responsibility of the filmmaker when the project is ""based on a true story"" is elevated when the story has significant historical relevance and blends such elements as art, identity, justice and international law. Add to those the quest of a remarkable woman whose family was ripped apart by Nazi insurgents, and more than a history lesson, it becomes a poignant personal story.Helen Mirren portrays Maria Altmann, the woman who emigrated to the United States by fleeing her Austrian homeland during World War II, and leaving behind her beloved family and all possessions. After the death of her sister, Ms. Altmann becomes aware of the family artwork stolen by the Nazi's during the invasion. This is not just any artwork, but multiple pieces from famed Austrian artist Gustav Klimt ¬Ö including ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer"". See, Adele was Maria's aunt, and the stunning piece (with gold leaf accents) has become ""the Mona Lisa of Austria"", while hanging for decades in the state gallery.The story revolves around Maria's partnering with family friend and upstart attorney Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) to take on the nation of Austria and reclaim the (extremely valuable) artwork that was seized illegally so many years ago. They are aided in their mission by an Austrian journalist (played by Daniel Bruhl) who is fighting his own demons. The seven-plus year legal saga is condensed for the big screen and we follow Maria and Randol as they meet with the Austrian art reclamation committee, a federal judge (played by the director's wife Elizabeth McGovern), the U.S. Supreme Court (Jonathan Pryce as Chief Justice), and finally a mediation committee back in Austria. But this is not really a courtroom drama ¬Ö it's a personal quest for justice and search for identity. What role does family roots and history play in determining who we are today? It's the age old question of past vs. present, only this is seen through the eyes of a woman who has survived what most of us can only imagine.Director Simon Curtis (My Week with Marilyn) uses startling flashbacks (with Tatiana Maslany as the younger Maria) to provide glimpses of Maria's childhood through her marriage and subsequent escape. We get to know her family, including some scenes featuring Aunt Adele (Antje Traue), and Maria's father and uncle (Henry Goodman, Allan Corduner). We understand this family's place in society and just how dramatically they were impacted by the Nazi takeover.Helen Mirren delivers yet another exceptional performance and manages to pull off the snappy lines without an ounce of schmaltz, while also capturing the emotional turmoil Ms. Altmann endures. Director Curtis and writer Alexi Kaye Campbell round off some of the rough edges and inject enough humor to prevent this from being the gut-wrenching process it probably was in real life. This approach makes the film, the story and the characters more relatable for most movie goers ¬Ö and it's quite an enjoyable look at a fascinating woman and a pretty remarkable underdog story."
La La Land,2016,8.0,"When Sebastian, a pianist, and Mia, an actress, follow their passion and achieve success in their respective fields, they find themselves torn between their love for each other and their careers.","The last time, I felt like this, in a cinema, I was six years old and I was watching Star Wars. I never imagined, I would ever find that feeling again in a cinema. That sense of being transported to another world.The opening sequence took my breath away and I never got it back. Not even at the end - which left my head spinning. It is a beautiful film with soul, wit, charm, style and love. It is simply outrageous! Bold and fantastic and fantastical.I am a straight man but my love for Ryan Gosling could change all that. He's a melancholy genius and Emma Stone is our muse.This film defies genre. It is a masterpiece. I urge you to see it. I was lucky enough to see it at the BFI London Film Festvial.It has been five days since I saw La La Land and I am still thinking about it and singing the haunting refrain that plays with your soul. I mean it gets in there - that music - the music of the firmament. Flying still, dreaming still... thank you Damien."
Hacksaw Ridge,2016,8.1,"World War II American Army Medic Desmond T. Doss, serving during the Battle of Okinawa, refuses to kill people and becomes the first man in American history to receive the Medal of Honor without firing a shot.","Reviewers say 'Hacksaw Ridge' is acclaimed for its intense war scenes, realistic combat portrayal, and the inspirational story of pacifist medic Desmond Doss. Mel Gibson's direction and Andrew Garfield's performance receive high praise. However, criticisms include over-the-top brutality, uneven pacing, and perceived lack of depth in character development and ethical dilemmas. Some note historical inaccuracies and excessive violence that overshadow emotional impact. Despite these issues, the film is generally seen as a powerful and moving war narrative."
Hidden Figures,2016,7.8,Three female African-American mathematicians play a pivotal role in astronaut John Glenn's launch into orbit while dealing with racial and gender discrimination.,"Hidden Figures is a real gem of a film.First and foremost this is down to some incredible performances. Taraji P Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae were an absolute joy to watch. From the very first scene with all three of them on screen together, you just knew the film was going to be something special. All three of them were fantastic and I couldn't take my eyes off of them. The supporting cast were also great, but it really was all about these three talented actresses smashing it.The story is something very special too. It was one I knew nothing about, but am so glad I now know more about it thanks to this film. Hidden Figures tracks the careers of three women working at NASA at the height of the space race. The film is so inspiring as we witness their perseverance, their incredible spirit and talent, and their pioneering impact on humanity's exploration of space. This alone would have been impressive, but these women were able to achieve what they did in the face of gut wrenching sexism and racism. Hidden Figures does such a good job of shining a light on the racism and despicable attitudes that these women had to face, and as a result is a pretty tough watch at times.What also makes this film very special is the expertly crafted script. If, like me, you have no idea about science and maths, don't let that put you off. The script does a great way of simplifying things, so that you can appreciate the gravity and importance of what these women were doing, without getting bogged down in heavy exposition.I really could not recommend this film enough. Everything about it fits together so perfectly, from the direction to the acting to the score, its just such a good well rounded film.Watch Hidden Figures ASAP! You will not be disappointed."
MacGruber,2010,5.6,"Former special operative MacGruber is called back into action to take down his arch-enemy, Dieter Von Cunth, who's in possession of a nuclear warhead and bent on destroying Washington, D.C.","Why does this film get such a low-rating? Well, just because it's super raunchy and not family-friendly or Oscar-worthy. If there was a rating for hilarious-ness, then this would be 11!
Rewatching is a must; there are so many great jokes written and they are delivered so well by Will Forte and the rest of the cast. They will make you laugh again and again and have a fun evening. SNL short Macgruber was one of the best of Will forte and of the writing team, delivering great jokes within 30 seconds, mocking in a sweet and respectful way the old classic series of Mcgyver and his adventures.
Maybe have a look in YouTube for these SNL shorts if you are not familiar with Mcgruber and this comedy style and you see right away what's this all about. It will make you understand some references but even as a stand-alone film, it delivers. If you like (or liked) SNL and if you are a fun of comedies with Will Ferrell, Andy Samberg or Seth Rogen/James Franco, then you will appreciate the humor and the hilarity of this film.11/10 hilarious."
Office Christmas Party,2016,5.9,"When his uptight CEO sister threatens to shut down his branch, the branch manager throws an epic Christmas party in order to land a big client and save the day, but the party gets way out of hand...",I was looking to watch a funny Christmas movie that isn't Elf or A Christmas Story so I gave this a chance since I really like Jason Bateman and I can say I was entertained throughout the whole thing. It's not the greatest movie ever but it checked the boxes I was looking for while watching. It's definitely stupid humor but it gave me a few good laughs
Vaiana,2016,7.6,"In ancient Polynesia, when a terrible curse incurred by the demigod Maui reaches Moana's island, she answers the Ocean's call to seek out Maui to set things right.","Reviewers say 'Moana' follows familiar Disney themes with a young protagonist on a self-discovery journey, vibrant animation, and memorable songs. It features a strong female lead, Polynesian culture, and mythology, including a demigod sidekick and animal companions. The quest to restore world balance offers unique cultural insights, providing a refreshing take on traditional Disney tropes despite formulaic elements."
Alice Through the Looking Glass,2016,6.2,"Alice is appointed to save her beloved Mad Hatter from deadly grief by travelling back to the past, but this means fatally harming Time himself, the noble clockwork man with the device needed to save the Hatter's family from the Red Queen.","I love Alice in Wonderland - In fact I love most fairy tale/fantasy movies. With the first Tim Burton Alice movie I wasn't disappointed, but the story took me by surprise. The same goes for this movie. But the surprise for me was that I really enjoyed this movie. I wasn't sure what to expect, so I went in not expecting much - and though the story line was a little bland - It was nice to see what became of Alice - Also in this movie, you learn things about people you didn't know. Such as the White and Red Queen's childhood. Take a step through the looking glass and follow Alice through an adventure to save The Mad Hatter's family - In a race to turn back time, Alice goes on another adventure and learns some things that cannot change the past, but can change the present."
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,2016,7.2,"In 1926, magizoologist Newt Scamander arrives in New York during his worldwide tour to research and rescue magical creatures as something mysterious leaves trails of destruction in the city, threatening to expose the wizarding world.","I watched this for the second time, having been a little disappointed first time around, and perhaps didn't have the best of days. My opinion, second time round, hasn't changed a great deal, the visuals and special effects are terrific, I just found the plot and storyline a little thin.I would say it helps if you're a huge fan of Harry Potter and JK Rowling's works, you may be a bit more forgiving, I found it a little bit frustrating. Definitely some good elements, but I'm not sure the elaborate visuals were enough to keep attention alone. It was a little dull in parts.I must pay huge credit to Eddie Redmayne, I thought he was great as the lead character, I'm so used to seeing him in serious dramas, it was nice to see him doing something different, he was great.They certainly put together an awesome cast for this one, Gemma Chan, Colin Farrell, John Voight, and of course the excellent Samantha Morton.6/10."
Creative Control,2015,5.4,"In near future Brooklyn, an ad executive uses a new Augmented Reality technology to conduct an affair with his best friend's girlfriend...sort of.","""Creative Control"" (2016 release; 97 min.) brings the story of two couples. There is David and his girlfriend Juliette. David is working at an ad agency and is tasked with coming up with a good ad campaign for a new ""augmented reality system"" called Augmenta. David gets to try it out (by wearing regular-looking glasses) for some time. Juliette is a yoga instructor. It looks like their relationship isn't the greatest. Then there is Wim and Sophie. Wim is David's long-time buddy who hasn't the slightest problem with cheating on Sophie. David then hires Sophie to come work at the ad agency. At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is the latest release from Amazon Studios, which is starting to spread its wings in the movie business quite nicely. Second, this is the Benjamin Dickinson show all the way: he stars (as David), directs, co-writes and co-produces this film, his first feature-length as a director. Dickinson sets the story in the not too distant future, where things still look quite familiar (certainly New York does), but technology has made continued progress. Yet the idea of an ""augmented reality system"" is of course not new. In fact, conceptually the movie is eerily similar to/reminiscent of that movie from the early 80s, ""Brainstorm"" (starring Christopher Walker and Natalie Wood, in her last film), where sex also was a big driver. Yes, I said sex. There is quite a bit of nudity in ""Creative Control"", so if that bothers you, you'd better pick another movie. ""Creative Control"" is shot in black and white, and given the slightly futuristic setting, it makes for a very stylish movie, and one of its better aspects. The other lead performers (Nora Zehetner as Juliette, Dan Gill as Wim, and Alexia Rasmussen as Sophie), all below the radar names, do their best to flesh out their characters, but in the end, the biggest failing of the movie is that it left me emotionally uninvolved and, frankly, I didn't feel invested in any of the movie. Plenty of style, but not enough substance.""Creative Control"" opened this weekend out of the blue without any pre-release buzz or advertising on a single screen here in Cincinnati. The Saturday matin√©e screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great. Given the lack of star power and lack of marketing for this movie, I can't imagine that this will play long in theaters. If you are into movies heavy on relationship drama but here with a sci-fi twist, I'd encourage you to check out ""Creative Control"", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually of DVD/Blu-ray and draw your own conclusions."
Arrival,2016,7.9,"Linguist Louise Banks leads a team of investigators when gigantic spaceships touch down around the world. As nations teeter on the verge of global war, Banks and her crew must find a way to communicate with the extraterrestrial visitors.","If you are looking for flashy, loud and generally speaking fast paced action Science Fiction: This is not the one you are looking for (no pun intended). But if you like slow, lingering and long shots, a movie that takes time to breathe and gives an epic scale to it's framing and cinematography, you could do a lot worse.I'm being a bit modest concerning the movie of course, because we're talking about a very well written script, that has a few surprises along the way and warrants more than one viewing and things to discover on those repeat viewings. It is really well acted and it has a story that is gripping as well as interesting from start to finish. The title alone suggests something, even if you haven't seen the trailer (which I didn't) - so you are in a way more prepared than our characters. But at the same time on their level ... So many Questions and not all get answered (at least not while watching it for the first time)"
Star Wars: Rogue One,2016,7.8,"In a time of conflict, a group of unlikely heroes band together on a mission to steal the plans to the Death Star, the Empire's ultimate weapon of destruction.","A Star Wars movie that hit hard before, but after seeing Andor, it hits even harder.Rogue One is a masterpiece of cinematography, acting, visual effects, and writing (even though it takes a while to get going at first).This movie is about the story of how ordinary people risk everything to get the plans to the Death Star, and they must endure hardships, even if it costs them their lives.Jyn Erso is the main character, the daughter of a Death Star engineer who was against the Empire and designed a weak spot in the Death Star. The movie is about her being recruited by the rebels, and they must get the plans to the star, along with Andor and other characters.The movie takes a while to get going, with all those points of view and jumps from character to character, planet to planet.It's only halfway through the film, when they leave Jedha and go looking for Galen Erso (The Engineer), that the film really takes off. And what more can we say about the ending? It's a masterpiece. It's tragic and realistic because it shows that rebellions aren't easy and cost lives, and it doesn't reveal all the suffering the characters must endure.The script is well-crafted; it could have been refined to remove some minor inconsistencies, but it was still quite good.After watching the Andor series, this film definitely hits harder, especially seeing everything Andor suffered, what he had to abandon to reach this point to serve with the rebels. Some of his lines carry more weight after what we saw in the series, and his connection with Jyn Erso makes it even more tragic because he has someone who understands him, someone who also lost everything, and until the end, they are connected in their purpose. The final shot of them embracing as the planet is destroyed definitely hits home after Andor.Rogue One is definitely an intense, emotional, and phenomenally constructed film, especially after seeing Andor. It has its minor script flaws, but otherwise, I can say it's a masterpiece.9.0 Stars."
Doctor Strange,2016,7.5,"While on a journey of physical and spiritual healing, a brilliant neurosurgeon is drawn into the world of the mystic arts.","Reviewers say 'Doctor Strange' is lauded for its stunning visuals, innovative special effects, and Benedict Cumberbatch's charismatic performance. The film's exploration of magic and mysticism is refreshing, though some find the story generic and pacing uneven. Tilda Swinton and Chiwetel Ejiofor are praised, but certain characters and villains are criticized for being underutilized and lacking depth. The humor and character development receive mixed opinions. Overall, 'Doctor Strange' is a visually impressive Marvel addition, though it doesn't fully innovate within the superhero genre."
"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife",1989,7.5,"At an opulent gourmet restaurant, a woman carries on an affair with deadly consequences.","First of all, I have to say that this film is one of my personal favorites, and that it is one of those things one must see during his or her lifetime.Truthfully, however, I first got into this film after hearing clips of the soundtrack on the Japanese version of Iron Chef, during a time before it was acquired by the Food Network. This film score, composed by the great post-minimalist Michael Nyman, is still one of the most haunting and soul-stirring scores in my opinion, if not the one of the most impressionable bodies of musical work ever. I still listen to the album on a weekly basis - it gets under your skin that way.The film itself is a piece of total art, as others have said. The sets are saturated with their singular color schemes (blue for the restaurant's exterior, green for the kitchen, white for the restrooms, and red for the main dining hall) , and people who have any sort of artistic training have valued and will continue to value this film as a character study of color. In this present age where most films present their interpretations of visual thrill through costly CG and SFX technologies, this film is a testament to how color can be a driving influence behind effective set design and cinematography.The principal actors, including the always amazing Helen Mirren and Michael Gambon, are first rate. Helen Mirren's Georgina is a truly heart-wrenching character, especially in the face of Gambon's portrayal of Albert Spica, a poor excuse for a human being and one of cinema's cruelest villains. The cook and lover are merely catalysts, serving to instigate the final act that is the undoing of Albert's overreaching tyranny.I suppose the anti-Thatcher sentiment is highly applicable to this film, but since I am not a British citizen, I feel that I cannot comment on this. However, I think the film's allegory can also be applied to other scenarios where a brutish figure uses violence and exploitation as a way to control others whose primary fault is only residing in the same physical/social/legal domain as the brute.In short, a masterpiece."
Nocturnal Animals,2016,7.4,"A wealthy art gallery owner is haunted by her ex-husband's novel, her memories of their relationship, and her regrets about her life.","That's some terrifying stuff right there! Fashion designer Tom Ford has written and directed his second movie, a multifaceted revenge thriller which is even better than his first, 2009's ""A Single Man"".Both are visually stylish, of course, which is expected from fashion guru, both have interesting premise and good actors, and both have this cold, unsettling atmosphere which tries to keep the viewer at some distance.In short, Ford has managed to take everything good from his solid debut project and bring it to the next level with ""Nocturnal Animals"". It's more lively, gripping, effortlessly cool and deeper.There are two stories, interwined in a way which may make viewers wonder whether it's real or imagined by the character. But it is ambiguous in a best possible way, not trying to f--k with our minds and then leave us hanging.An unhappily married woman (Amy Adams) thinks she wants his first husband (Jake Gyllenhaal) back. And she reads his novel, a violent thriller, which seems like a revenge tale. And then things get more, er, complex.On-screen events are exciting already but Ford the writer turns out surprisingly skillful at making it even varied, without getting stuck or losing steam, or letting us think that we know where all this ends up. He even playfully takes jabs at his main fashion job and the lifestyle and personal sacrifices that come with it.And the whole result really makes you feel something for the characters, unlike many of the thrillers that only manage to arouse the viewer during their best bits.It's not mostly about Adams and Gyllenhaal. There is a number of smaller but important characters and cool performances. We have Michael Shannon, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Isla Fisher, Armie Hammer, Michael Sheen, Laura Linney.The cast is good enough reason to watch it. Everybody adds something worthwhile to the experience, even Sheen and Fisher and especially Linney who all have rather small roles used to move the story along.Shannon brings his usual magnetic mix of cool and creepy. Gyllenhaal manages to move between having balls and ball-less state without turning unbelievable or too heroic. Taylor-Johnson as the bad guy even got a Golden Globe for his work (the only one for the movie although Tom Ford got nominated for both best movie / drama and adapted screenplay). He really deserves it, he is evil at its most subtle and delicious. Delicious to watch, I mean.But I am especially happy about Amy Adams who is often used in the movies as just a pretty face or supporting woman. In 2016, she has had two strong roles, in a thinking man's sci-fi ""Arrival"", and now this.Her screen time may be limited but she surely makes the most of it, captivatingly playing out both worlds that the character has hiding inside her. I believed her both as a lively young woman and the jaded older one that's missing all the ideals that she had decided to throw away long time ago.Based on a novel by Austin Wright which Ford wanted to adapt into two movies initially, one true to original, the other not so much. I am not sure which way he chose ultimately but what a ride, eh?PS No, I am not giving 9 out of 10 to every movie I watch from now on. The last three have been just some of 2016's best of the best."
400 Days,2015,4.4,"With their 400-day mission simulation nearing completion, 4 astronauts begin to feel something's amiss.","400 Days: 2.5/10When I say the ending is lazy, I mean that they didn't even bother making an ending. The movie cuts off before the ending. It could have been good, or even great. But with the amount of set-up and build-up, it feels even worse to have no ending than if the ending were 'bad' or unsatisfying. The entire movie was only intriguing (and it was intriguing) because you're guessing what's real and what isn't; you're trying to predict what the twists could be; you're trying to sort misleads and hints the entire way through... and you're given NOTHING in return. There are no misleads or hints. There are no twists. There are no answers given. There is literally no ending. There is nothing valuable given to you as a viewer.I rate it 2.5 instead of zero because at least most of the suspense and intrigue was compelling. But with literally no payoff for anything, it's unforgettable in the worst way. If even one question was answered partway through, it would have felt slightly better, but I just feel betrayed. This is one of the worst movies ever in my opinion."
The Call Up,2016,4.9,A group of online gamers are invited to try a state-of-the-art virtual reality video game but things take a sinister turn when these masters of the shoot-'em-up discover that they will actually be fighting for their lives.,"I'm a little stunned at some of the bad reviews this movies has had. It isn't that bad at all. It has it's typical character types for a movie of this type to give the story a bit of 'zap' and these characters emerge immediately. It's well done for a low budget movie, with good acting and directing ideas, and for once, I didn't pre-empt what the ending would be like. I was a little surprised, which doesn't happen often, yet viewers will determine the way the movie will go, as that is what it is..a game. I can tell you, there are some shocking movies out there that have ratings too high, with acting so laughable and the directing a nightmare to watch, yet this movie holds it own, actors and direction. See for yourself."
Far from the Madding Crowd,2015,7.1,"In Victorian England, the independent and headstrong Bathsheba Everdene attracts three very different suitors: Gabriel Oak, a sheep farmer; Frank Troy, a reckless Sergeant; and William Boldwood, a prosperous and mature bachelor.","This film, by the Danish director Thomas Vinterberg, is the first cinematic adaptation of Thomas Hardy's ""Far from the Madding Crowd"" since John Schlesinger's famous version in 1967. The story is too well- known for me to set out the plot at any length, but it revolves around the adventures of Bathsheba Everdene, a young female landowner in Victorian Dorset, and the three men who love her. These are Gabriel Oak, a humble shepherd, William Boldwood, a neighbouring farmer, and Frank Troy, a sergeant in a cavalry regiment.Vinterberg has set himself a difficult task. Schlesinger's film was a landmark of British cinema, marking the beginning of what I have come to think of the ""heritage cinema"" style of film-making. In my eyes at least, and I suspect in the eyes of many others, it has become the definitive version; I cannot re-read the novel- it is a favourite of mine and I have read it several times- without picturing Bathsheba as Julie Christie, Gabriel as Alan Bates, Troy as Terence Stamp or Boldwood as Peter Finch.Like Schlesinger, Vinterberg sticks fairly closely to Hardy's story, although of necessity some minor episodes have had to be omitted. There were one or two touches I didn't really care for, such as the scene where Troy grabs Bathsheba by the crotch. In the novel Hardy describes Troy's seduction of the young woman with great delicacy. This is not just a question of Victorian prudery, but also of psychological realism. A girl as independent and determined as Bathsheba would have resented such a crude approach; had Troy attempted it he would doubtless have got his face slapped for his pains. I also felt that this version rather inflated the social status of both Bathsheba and Boldwood. In the novel both are prosperous farmers, but nothing more. Here they live in the sort of style which would suggest she is the Lady of the Manor and he a wealthy aristocrat.Hardy's novel is, among other things, a celebration of the English countryside, and this aspect is brought out well here. Like Schlesinger's, the film is visually attractive with some striking photography of the rural landscapes, often seen bathed in a soft, golden glow. On the acting side I was most impressed by Matthias Schoenaerts as Gabriel. His interpretation is rather different from Bates's, making his character perhaps more genteel and less rough-hewn, but still a man of great sensitivity and integrity. The Belgian-born Schoenaerts speaks flawless English with no hint of a foreign inflection, although it is noticeable that, unlike Bates, he does not attempt a West Country accent. Possibly wisely- English regional accents can be notoriously difficult for foreign-born actors.On the other hand, I was less impressed by Tom Sturridge who makes an unmemorable Troy, lacking the roguishness and devil-may-care charm which Stamp brought to the role. Michael Sheen is better as Boldwood, but never quite matches Finch's desperate, nervous intensity. The difference, perhaps, is that Sheen's Boldwood is obsessed by Bathsheba whereas Finch's is almost literally possessed by her. Carey Mulligan has plenty of experience in films of this type, having inherited the crown formerly worn by Helena Bonham-Carter and Keira Knightley, that of Reigning Queen of Period Drama. She has been praised for her performance here, but personally I preferred Christie's rather more imperious and headstrong interpretation. Vinterberg's film is a generally solid, well- made piece of period drama, but for me it will not replace Schlesinger's as the definitive version. 7/10"
A Bigger Splash,2015,6.4,A famous rock star's vacation in Italy with her boyfriend is disrupted by the unexpected visit of an old friend and his daughter.,"Luca Guadagnino has a certain style that exudes pure unbridled sexuality, lavish Italian landscapes and tension between the characters. There's no doubt he's an accomplished filmmaker with an old-school Italian filmmaking style that people just love.This film introduces its four characters in various awkward and ambiguous ways. Harry is an extroverted and irritating highly talkative music producer trying to woo back Tilda Swinton's character Marianne, a famous rock star, who is in a relationship with Paul (Matthias Schoenaerts). Dakota Johnson plays Harry's (supposed) young blonde daughter, who is not always truthful about certain things.At several points throughout the film, the foursome strip completely nude to swim, sunbathe or sleep (Ralph Fiennes, exuding sexy dad energy, is the most fond of exposing himself when going in the water) And yet, in terms of inner life, soul and heart-speak, there is very little to show. There are a few flashbacks to show titbits of the relationship between characters, but not much else. Johnson's character is especially underwritten, and we don't get into that much of who she really is until the very end of the movie.As a result of the these people not being fleshed out, I wasn't able to connect with their struggles or wants.Stripping of the soul is far more intimate and alluring than the stripping of clothes."
Why Him?,2016,6.2,A holiday gathering threatens to go off the rails when Ned Fleming realizes that his daughter's Silicon Valley millionaire boyfriend is about to pop the question.,"My question is simply this, why would Brian Cranston, the fine actor that he is, appear in this farce. The premise is silly and the story line is boring at best. This movie makes Cranston's character out to be an idiot just because he doesn't agree with everything the fianc√© does. Besides, no Father would honestly agree to approve a marriage of his daughter to this guy. A waste of 2 hours"
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2016,5.5,"Alice returns to where the nightmare began: The Hive in Raccoon City, where the Umbrella Corporation is gathering its forces for a final strike against the only remaining survivors of the apocalypse.","Resident Evil: The Final Chapter reprises Milla Jovovich as Alice in the fifth sequel of the franchise that Paul Anderson derived back in 2002. Ali Larter rejoins Milla along with Iain Glen to bring a ridicules plot to an end, hopefully. I couldn't stand the single camera action sequences, I felt like the camera was doing all the fighting and not the characters. Unlike the original where slow motion camera angles made the franchise famous, this one was made on the cheap. The franchise did become the single most successful horror movie series in history but this flick was less horror and more how did this whole storyline get started. You may skip this one but if you want t know the ending maybe check it out."
Assassin's Creed,2016,5.6,"Callum Lynch explores the memories of his ancestor Aguilar de Nerha and gains the skills of a Master Assassin, before taking on the secret Templar society.","I understand that some characters might have underwritten but people that bashing this movie as confusing are beyond me, maybe they just like or expect some full blown explosions and mediocre/boring setting. this is as simple as it can get. though the movie should've utilize more of its time with cutting some of exposition scenes and replace it with character developments, I get that it's beautiful but some time it's a little bit obnoxious. Also at least the action are far more clearer than half of action movies with their shaky cams. the parkour and fighting scenes though not a lot but executed pretty well. 7,5/10I'll be honest I enjoyed this movie more than CA: Civil War. Though now I much prefer if this series made as a TV series not a movie. Maybe that's why some people still confused by the whole story and lore. So to summary:Pros:+ overall good MC and M. Fasbender did a great performances.+ decent acting for some characters.+ Beautiful Cinematography.+ a faithful depictions of Assassins and Templars from the series.+ well done action scenes. good parkour and fighting scenes. shaky cams and obnoxious jump cuts are pretty minimal, maybe only 1-2 scenes.+ decent music but definitely could do moreCons:Average story and plots, pretty similar to the first game storyline but with some changes and twists.-Some dialogues were not that good. Not immersive and bit awkward.-Some characters were underdeveloped, especially in the past time.-a bit underwhelming ending, obvious sequel baiting.-too many stay still/exposition scenes, maybe they should cut those and give some characters a perspectives and developments."
John Wick 2,2017,7.4,"After returning to the criminal underworld to repay a debt, John Wick discovers that a large bounty has been put on his life.","Reviewers say 'John Wick: Chapter 2' is lauded for its intense action, impressive choreography, and Keanu Reeves' performance. The film expands the John Wick universe with new characters and locations. However, some find the plot less compelling than the first film, criticizing pacing and character motivations. The action scenes, especially the hall of mirrors fight and practical effects, are frequently highlighted. Despite some criticisms, it is generally seen as a worthy sequel that maintains the franchise's high-octane style and world-building."
Manchester by the Sea,2016,7.8,A depressed uncle is asked to take care of his teenage nephew after the boy's father dies.,"Reviewers say 'Manchester by the Sea' is a poignant exploration of grief and redemption, lauded for its authentic portrayal of human emotions and standout performances, especially by Casey Affleck. Central themes include family, guilt, and moving forward after tragedy. The film's pacing and length are both praised for contemplative depth and criticized for dragging. Cinematography and direction create an immersive atmosphere. Despite mixed opinions on its impact, the movie is recognized for powerful storytelling and emotional depth."
Interstate 60: Episodes of the Road,2002,7.5,"Neal Oliver, a very confused young artist, takes a journey of a lifetime on a highway that doesn't exist on any map, going to places he's never heard of, searching for an answer and his dream girl.","I actually feel compelled to comment on this movie, and I haven't been compelled in a long time.Simply put this film was excellent from the outset. I was hooked from go. No other movie this year can touch its quirkiness. It's a road movie that takes you to the greatest places that aren't there - you'll see what I mean. Some of the comments on society (in most cases American society) were spot on. And you cannot predict where it will go next, you just have to take the ride and accept. Each stop gets better.Now its entertainment, so don't think it has message written all over it (although it kinda does), Gary Oldman does a wonderful turn as our wish granter, and it's the best film Marsden and Smart have done. The rest of the supporting cast are superb with too many to mention.I haven't spent two better hours this year."
Underworld: Blood Wars,2016,5.8,Vampire death dealer Selene (Kate Beckinsale) fights to end the eternal war between the Lycan clan and the Vampire faction that betrayed her.,"I can say this one, is one of the best movies of the saga Underworld, is a good action movie, with a good story. If you have seen all the previous movies of underworld you will love this one, because is like a fresh restart, but without deleting all the past like happened in Terminator Genesys (I hated) and is well written.This time vampires and werewolves are amazingly organize, and the story continues in a good way. You can go to see this one without any fear, you wont regret it."
Mustang,2015,7.6,"When five orphan girls are seen innocently playing with boys on a beach, their scandalized conservative guardians confine them while forced marriages are arranged.","I am Turkish. I know how people behave in rural parts of Turkey. This movie is so ridiculously bad I would not waste another sentence for it if it wasn't for the minimal review length requirement of IMDb. So here it is, 10 lines... Actors do not even come close to give an authentic depiction of how people living in a village in ƒ∞nebolu act and behave. The story is a disaster. The general attitude of the movie is tastelessly didactic. Don't you ever think that you get a somewhat accurate representation of anything regarding Turkish society from this excuse of a movie. The director/writer does obviously not know how things work in rural parts of Turkey. One of the writers is not even Turkish. So, go figure... The fuss around this movie (oscar nomination etc.) is a textbook case of westerners appreciating narratives about the rest of the world which justify their ideological preconceptions."
Logan,2017,8.1,"In a future where mutants are nearly extinct, an elderly and weary Logan leads a quiet life. But when Laura, a mutant child pursued by scientists, comes to him for help, he must get her to safety.","Reviewers say 'Logan' is acclaimed for its mature tone, strong performances, and realistic superhero portrayal. Hugh Jackman and Dafne Keen deliver standout performances, enhancing the film's emotional depth. The R-rating is praised for allowing intense violence and mature themes. However, some find the story simplistic, pacing slow, and villains underdeveloped. Despite these issues, 'Logan' is seen as a poignant conclusion to Jackman's Wolverine."
Terminator Genisys,2015,6.3,"When John Connor, leader of the human resistance, sends Sgt. Kyle Reese back to 1984 to protect Sarah Connor and safeguard the future, an unexpected turn of events creates a fractured timeline.","The story starts a bit confusing, but after a short time it's back to business. It's a great addition to the series and it's nice to see Arnold back in this role. The special effects are not always the best, but most parts look great. The new type terminator is great, but the old T800 is still not obsolete. The story is convincing enough and can be the prelude of new additions to this series. I hope Arnold will be part of these. It's a pity 3D is still the norm in most cinemas. This movie is best viewed in normal 2D. It's dark en there are no special benefits in 3D. The movie gives also a good critical note about our dependency of our smart-phones, tablets and the Internet integration. Genisys might be more true that we realize ;)"
Fifty Shades Darker,2017,4.6,"While Christian wrestles with his inner demons, Anastasia must confront the anger and envy of the women who came before her.","This movie is so awful, that it is hard to find words to describe it. I really can't imagine why there are so many people that are willing to go and see in in the cinemas. This movie is not bad, because of the idea for an affair between a rich businessman and a normal girl. It is bad because the dialogues are flat, the characters are terrible and without any depth, there is no actual acting in it, and for the final the story is badly written.It is really sad, that such a badly made movies are so popular. They destroy the idea for good movie with acting, script and everything else. And if you expect to see at least a lot of erotic in it, you may fell a bit disappointed at the end. The movie is far from that it promises to its viewers."
Freaks and Geeks,,8.8,A high school mathlete starts hanging out with a group of burnouts while her younger brother navigates his freshman year.,"Reviewers say 'Freaks and Geeks' is acclaimed for its authentic portrayal of high school life, focusing on social outcasts. The show is lauded for realistic adolescence depiction, addressing identity and family dynamics. Critics praise the ensemble cast's performances, including future stars. The series blends humor and drama, capturing teenage complexity. Its detailed setting, period elements, and memorable soundtrack enhance nostalgic appeal. Despite early cancellation, it has a cult following and is regarded as seminal television."
Predator,1987,7.8,A team of commandos on a mission in a Central American jungle find themselves hunted by an extraterrestrial warrior.,"Reviewers say 'Predator' is acclaimed for its thrilling fusion of action, horror, and sci-fi, enhanced by its jungle setting and suspenseful narrative. The Predator's advanced tech and menacing presence are standout elements. Practical effects and minimal CGI contribute to its authenticity. Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance as Dutch is praised for depth and believability. The ensemble cast's chemistry and memorable one-liners add charm. Despite critiques about plot inconsistencies and unrealistic aspects, 'Predator' is widely regarded as an engaging, timeless experience."
Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb,2014,6.2,"Larry Daley and his heroic friends embark on the greatest adventure of their lives, as they travel to London to save the magic that, after dark, allows the museum's exhibits to come to life.","Another day, another sequel and this one is unfortunately another kids movie that shouldn't have seen the light of day. I'm not against sequels mind you, but in most kids series seldom is any sequel as good as the first installment. This is the case for this past weekend's release starring the ever wacky Ben Stiller and his posse of celebrities. Yes my friends we take another trip back to the museum, for another hopefully fun adventure amidst it's hallowed halls. So sit back and read a late review of another Night at the Museum, the Secret of the Tomb.Likes: One thing I have always liked with this series is the selection of exhibits they choose to bring to life, and the integration of their personalities. This installment brings the magic early on, bringing back familiar faces like Teddy (Robin Williams), Jed (Owen Wilson), and Octavius (Steve Coogan) in all their comedic glory. Amidst a grand speech, cool CGI effects are put into effect to bring the constellations alive that shine in all their cool blue light before chaos arises. Once we get to the London museum, more exciting things come alive, in the form of another CGI fossil, a mythical snake demon made of metal, and the warrior with golden locks Lancelot (Dan Stevens). The effects are fluid, the designs beautiful, and when actually integrated into the movie, more on that later, you get the fun feeling you got in the first movie. Unfortunately most of these objects are background, aimlessly wandering around the scene while the big boys come out to play.Outside of the special effects there are some fun pokes at human society's obsessions, especially at internet videos, pop culture, and of course ridiculous habits that celebrities have. Some of these jokes are well timed, often delivered in a manner that is quite funny. However, many of the jokes, as happens most of the time, lose their charm and the lack of any witty humor makes it pretty much just mindless rambling that kids will only enjoy. Oh sure it's cute, but Hollywood needs to learn that more isn't necessary funnier, in fact it's the opposite. However, audiences allow them to get away with it, so what is the use in complaining.Now past funny, this Night at the Museum has another emotional side to it, helping to teach the moral lesson of moving on in the magical theatrical way. With the use of orchestrated symphony work, well angled camera shots, decent writing, and of course great acting, I'll admit I got that tingly feeling all over. No it's not gas, but those looking for a life lesson reminder will get it in this film, and a decent closing to the series¬Ö I think. As for acting, well Stiller gets the most screen time on this one. The verdict, it's alright¬Ö when he's not acting like a buffoon, and the man has some surprising agility and giant snake battle skills. Most of the time he is a bumbling idiot, but given enough time he can pull out some other feelings that we saw in Meet the Parents. As for Williams, may he rest in peace, the man gave one brilliant performance despite his character being diluted from its previous glory.Dislikes: A lot in this category for this reviewer. It starts with the adventure, which in the third installment has been diluted to a rushed set of sequences, hastily edited together to get out in time for Christmas. A shame since the tale had promise of suspense, timing, and mystery that could have tied so many things together. Instead, the story lacked any depth, quickly revealing the secret without so much a trial, a challenge, or even an argument, it was just handed right to them and a rather lame story as well. In addition, a lot of the suspense was missing in this film, with only an irregular decay in the tablet's magic threatening our heroes. Speaking of which the cavalcade also lost their spunk, the strong willed character reduced to comedic boobs, some of which hardly utter a line, as Ben Stiller takes center stage. Such a shame indeed, but your kids will get a kick out of the simplistic journey, that is if they can sit in there seats¬Ö which some chose not to.Instead the adventure was put aside for¬Ö comedy, or what passed for it in this movie. Yes there were a few zingers at first, but they quickly were lost to stupid rants of ridiculous arguing with his caveman doppleganger, stupid exchange of words with exhibits, and some rather awkward discussions with Rebel Wilson. Sure it happens once or twice I can handle it, but it just kept happening, even at the big, exciting climax, with the lame bad guy. Why can these films not realize the limits of tired jokes? I can't answer it either, but sadly it took away from the movie. Perhaps this comedy was the reason why the characters were also a shell of their former glory, and why they were pretty much background characters with the new exhibits. Even the normally cute dynamic between father and son was bad, Hollywood choosing to make the son another lame teenager like most movies do. Is it accurate? Probably, but in a movie with magical tablets you would think a little magic could spread to the humans as well.I'm not going to lie, this movie failed me on many levels, and disappointed me for the grand conclusion. Still, it is a cute film that kids will handle, and still holds a little of the spark that got me into the series. Worth a trip to the theater? Not really, but if you wish to pay homage to a few of the stars I wouldn't blame you. My scores for this film are:Adventure/Comedy/Family: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0"
T2 Trainspotting,2017,7.1,"After 20 years abroad, Mark Renton returns to Scotland and reunites with his old friends Sick Boy, Spud, and Begbie.","T2 is all you could hope a sequel can be. Independent and respectful to its predecessor while standing on its own merits as a great movie, art even, powerful maybe. 20 years on things have changed,mostly. It's funny,sad and mature above all else. Boyles directing is complemented with a great script and beautiful cinematography. On to the important aspects, the film plays cleverly With nostalgia without depending on it,giving the audience of the 1996 cult classic something to savor, while also standing independently as an entertaining and even inventive film. Performances are a solid as you'd expect, Robert Carlyle returns in a fantastic albeit expected performance as begbie. The film introduces the advancement in technology over the intervening years with inventive and clever special effects, however the original also boasted some amazing trick of the lens. Finally upon leaving the cinema one gets a feeling of bittersweet and sorrowful fulfillment, the characters we've come to know over the last 20 years hive us nearly two hours of nostalgia packed entertainment, yet one can't help but long for its energetic,frenetic and classic predecessor, no matter how good its sequel is, and it is."
The Zookeeper's Wife,2017,7.0,"Keepers of the Warsaw Zoo, Antonina and Jan Zabinski, must save hundreds of people and animals during the Nazi invasion in WWII Poland.","Based on the non-fiction book of the same name, 'The Zookeeper's Wife' recounts the true story of the husband-and-wife couple, Jan and Antonina ≈ªabi≈Ñski, who secretly sheltered Jews during the German invasion of Poland from 1939 to 1945 on their premises of the Warsaw Zoo, thus enabling these Polish Jews to escape from the infamous Warsaw Ghetto and the eventual extermination of the place as well as its inhabitants within.At its heart, this is a celebration of ordinary heroes ‚Äì that is, of ordinary men and women who have displayed extraordinary heroism during extraordinary times. Such tales are often told with sycophantic adulation, which runs counter to the nature of their character/s and ultimately leaves one feeling patronized. Thankfully, its director Niki Caro knows her way around such celebrations of heroism (as evinced by her previous works like 'Whale Rider', 'North Country' and 'McFarland, USA'), placing emphasis on the difficult circumstances of the war in order to demonstrate the ≈ªabi≈Ñskis' bravery rather than on exalting the characters per se. Scenes of life pre- and post-invasion, of life behind the ghettos and of the nail-biting process of sneaking the Jews out of the ghettos are played out with attention to detail and realism, just so the context under which the ≈ªabi≈Ñskis were living under as well as the danger they were putting themselves and their only son Ryszard under are felt keenly and profoundly ‚Äì hence illuminating the spirit of valour and self-sacrifice their deeds exemplified.Those who have read Diane Ackerman's source novel will probably know that her narration is as much about Jan and Antonina ≈ªabi≈Ñski as it is about Lutz Heck, the duplicitous head of the Berlin Zoo whom the ≈ªabi≈Ñskis first meet before the war and who eventually turns out to be one of the prominent figures of the German war office in Poland. Like in the book, Lutz aimed to recreate pureblood versions of certain extinct species; and for dramatic impact, instead of transporting some of the cattle from the Warsaw Zoo to run his animal eugenics programme back in Berlin, Lutz (as played by Daniel Bruhl) does so right on the grounds of the former. That deviation allows screenwriter Angela Workman to fashion a rather unnecessary subplot between Antonina and Lutz, which sees Lutz develop a personal liking for Antonina and concomitantly engendering marital tension between Jan and Antonina. As distracting as that may be, it is consoling that neither Lutz nor the Germans in particular are demonized; in fact, the former's on screen representation shows an unexpectedly benevolent side at the end that may in fact be kinder than his real-life person.In turn, the horrors of the Holocaust are depicted through a fictional character which Caro has said was her idea. Played by Israeli actress Shira Haas, Urszula is a barely teenage girl whom Jan encounters on his maiden trip into the ghetto bleeding and shaken after being raped by two German male soldiers. Against better judgment, Jan conceals her right under the driver's seat of his truck (under his son's feet, no less) in order to help her escape from any further misery. Though manipulative, Urszula's addition is arguably an effective device through which Caro conveys the magnitude of the ≈ªabi≈Ñskis' rescue efforts ‚Äì not only is she intended to be emblematic of the suffering and subsequent trauma that the Jewish children no doubt endured during the German invasion, she is the face of the persecuted Jewish, personifying the 'human' in humanity. Her recovery is also representative of the hope that the ≈ªabi≈Ñskis' act of wartime courage gave to the 300 Jews that they saved in the six years of the German occupation.As with such historical dramatisations, the strength of the performances determines whether the film itself ends up being compelling ‚Äì and sure enough, that 'The Zookeeper's Wife' is fascinating to watch from start to finish is testament to the strong cast. However cynical you may be of Jessica Chastain's casting as Antonina which therefore requires the Hollywood actress to put on a Polish accent, she is undeniably captivating as the eponymous lead, channeling grit and vulnerability in equal measure as she fleshes out her character's fears, anxieties and convictions. Her stripped- down performance complements that of Belgian actor Johan Heldenbergh, who may not have matin√©e-idol looks but certainly the gravitas to play a resolute volunteer for the underground Polish resistance. Among the supporting actors, Bruhl and Haas are the standouts, the former exercising admirable restraint in what could have been a traditionally villainous act while the latter surprisingly nuanced in her portrayal of the most visible victim of Nazi sadism.Many a story has been told of ordinary men and women who have displayed extraordinary heroism during the Holocaust, and 'The Zookeeper's Wife' stands out among one of the better ones by simply telling its story well without embellishment or worse exaggeration. Even better, it underscores the emotional devastation of war without violence or gore; rather, with emphasis on authenticity, the film lays bare the communities torn apart when the Germans invaded, the sheer hopelessness of those who were oppressed, and the sacrifices that one must sometimes make in order to achieve a loftier, nobler purpose during such challenging times. Especially when some world leaders seem to have forgotten the importance of world peace, this is as apt a reminder as any that the cost of war is immeasurable, immutable and perhaps even irreversible."
The Last Witch Hunter,2015,5.9,The last witch hunter is all that stands between humanity and the combined forces of the most horrifying witches in history.,"A witch hunter cursed to live forever finds himself facing the witch who placed the curse on him. It was trashed by the critics - and there's no doubt that talk of witch prisons and the like is more than a little silly - but The Last Witch Hunter is nevertheless enjoyable trash if not taken too seriously. Diesel gives a charismatic performance as the title character, and receives solid support from the likes of Michael Caine and Elijah Wood. Only a protracted final act spoils the mindless fun"
Deepwater Horizon,2016,7.1,"A dramatization of the disaster in April 2010, when the offshore drilling rig called the Deepwater Horizon exploded, resulting in the worst oil spill in history.","Deepwater Horizon is a movie that succeeds on two levels: as an action-packed blockbuster and as an honest depiction of a tragic disaster. It's the story of the BP oil rig that exploded and contaminated the Gulf of Mexico. The way Berg directs the sequence of events is well paced and purposefully developmental for a good chunk of the movie. It takes about 45 minutes before the crap hits the fan, during which we're allowed time to get to know the characters - their quirks, their personalities - so we can empathize with their situation. The stakes feel real, as they should (and were), which is a testament to the directing and the acting. Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell dominate in their roles, Russell given the opportunity to remind us why he's one of the biggest stars ever. The supporting cast is excellent, including John Malkovich, Gina Rodriguez, and Dylan O'Brien, who have chemistry and rapport between other characters (Malkovich and Russell sharing a couple intense moments where not a word is said).The disaster itself is portrayed brilliantly. The tone remains frantic and the stunning special effects work puts it over the edge. Once things go south, it's a nonstop adrenaline rush till the end. The only reason it's not rated higher is because it's merely a depiction of events, nothing groundbreaking or revolutionary in regards to storytelling. But it didn't have to be. This was a tragic event and the gritty realism shown here is as refreshing as it is intense. If you're in the mood for a deeper-than-average thrill-ride, look no further than Deepwater Horizon."
The Founder,2016,7.2,"The story of Ray Kroc, a salesman who turned two brothers' innovative fast food eatery, McDonald's, into the biggest restaurant business in the world, with a combination of ambition, persistence, and ruthlessness.","The Founder is another tale of the American Dream. It's the kind of tale we've seen a million times before. American man wants to become successful, sacrifices morality for moolah, etc. It's The Godfather, it's The Social Network, it's The Wolf of Wall Street. And The Founder, while entertaining, offers pretty much nothing new, or distinctive, to contribute. It is directed fairly conventionally, the story hits all the beats you'd expect, and it's not going to stick to your memory for too long.But that discounts the fact that the film is rather well made. Performances are uniformly solid, and the film is undeniably compelling for much of its run time. But the real reason to see the film is the powerhouse performance of Michael Keaton, a neglected actor throughout the 2000s who seems to be finally getting roles that he deserves with this, Spotlight and Birdman to consider. He is slimy, charismatic, and curiously sympathetic in all the right ways.In all The Founder may not light your world on fire, but it's a rock solid tale of greed and the American Dream that ought to entertain most that it meets.Side Note -I have no idea why this is playing in Australia over a month before it comes out across the rest of the world, but hey I'm not complaining."
Hudson Hawk,1991,5.7,A cat burglar is forced to steal Da Vinci works of art for a world domination plot.,"This was one of the first films that I saw when I came back from the Persian Gulf War.  It is listed as among the biggest money losers of all time and when it came out it generated some of the most scathing reviews of all time. When Bruce Willis made The Last Boy Scout later that year, one reviewer said ""He gets punched in the mouth so many times, he must feel like he's still reading reviews of Hudson Hawk"" Willis wrote the story for this film, so I'm sure this must have particularly hurt him, this film put his career in the toilet before Pulp Fiction revived it. I don't think the film was all that bad myself, even though it wasn't Citizen Kane and wont go down in history as a classic I am at least hoping that it might generate a cult following. At least it attempts to be original, you have to give it credit for that. So many movies these days are just rip offs. Willis gives an engaging performance as the cappachino-drinking, wise-cracking cat burglar who is forced to pull off one last hiest. I really laughed at the scene where he and Danny Aiello pull off that robbery while doing such a wonderful rendition of ""Would You Like To Swing On A Star"". Aiello is a great actor as is Andie McDowell and James Coburn who also give great supporting performances. Coburn has a lot of fun spoofing his tough guy image. It sort of reminds me of In Like Flynt. My best advice is leave your brain at the beginning of the movie and just have a good time. Yes this film wont cure cancer or anything like that, but its still a lot of fun if you just give it a chance."
Goodfellas,1990,8.7,"The story of Henry Hill and his life in the mafia, covering his relationship with his wife Karen and his mob partners Jimmy Conway and Tommy DeVito.","Reviewers say 'Goodfellas' is a cinematic masterpiece, lauded for its raw depiction of mob life and Martin Scorsese's exceptional direction. Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci deliver remarkable performances, with Pesci's character noted for its intensity and humor. The film's technical elements, such as cinematography, editing, and soundtrack, significantly enhance the story. Although some critics point out issues with character depth and pacing, 'Goodfellas' is widely considered one of Scorsese's finest works and a quintessential gangster film."
2036: Nexus Dawn,2017,6.9,Niander Wallace demonstrates the merits of a new type of replicant to lawmakers.,"In ""2036: Nexus Dawn"", Wallace (Jared Leto) demonstrates a new kind of replicant, who will absolutely obey the orders from human and never run. But the lawmaker (Benedict Wong) does not seem to believe in him. The short should show how the lawmaker changes his attitude and maybe include a possible discussion among the magistrates."
Blade Runner,1982,8.1,A blade runner must pursue and terminate four replicants who stole a ship in space and have returned to Earth to find their creator.,"Reviewers say 'Blade Runner' is acclaimed for its deep themes, striking visuals, and intricate story, often noting its examination of humanity, identity, and artificial life ethics. Many commend its philosophical richness and immersive world, blending film noir with sci-fi. However, some find the pacing slow and characters underdeveloped. Debate exists over different cuts, with preferences varying between the original and director's cut. The soundtrack and special effects, though innovative, receive mixed reviews, with some considering them dated or mood-dependent."
2048: Nowhere to Run,2017,6.8,"Gentle Sapper, a replicant, unleashes his true power when he sees his loved ones in trouble.","Yes, this was really good and it leaves you wanting more. Dave Bautista gives a great performance here and the cinematography is lovely. The set looked great too for what it was. For these five minutes you are in this universe."
Live by Night,2016,6.4,"A group of Boston-bred gangsters set up shop in balmy Florida during the Prohibition era, facing off against the competition and the Ku Klux Klan.","Actor/writer/director Ben Affleck tries his hand at a period piece in this ambitious crime saga beginning in the 1920s Prohibition era. Joe Coughlin--the son of a renowned Boston police officer--is a small-time crook looking to make a name for himself in the ruthless underworld of organized crime. After some tragic circumstances, he relocates to the South to become the frontman/muscle for an Italian mafia bootlegging operation, but quickly gets plunged into the seedy, seductive world of money, power, greed, and corruption. Intriguing at first, with tense action scenes and character interactions, but follows too many unrelated story threads, has ineffective casting in key roles, too many familiar elements, and concludes in pat, sanctimonious fashion. Despite flavorful ingredients, Affleck's attempt to create a potent, moralizing amalgam of The Town and The Godfather doesn't quite succeed. **¬Ω"
The Maze Runner,2014,6.8,"Thomas is deposited in a community of boys after his memory is erased, soon learning they're all trapped in a maze that will require him to join forces with fellow ""runners"" for a shot at escape.","My immediate thought while watching The Maze Runner was just how close the whole premise was to Vincent Natali's sci-fi horror Cube (1997), both films featuring a group of people who wake to find themselves in a strange environment with no memory of how they got there. The big difference is that, where Cube was a brilliantly executed low-budget thriller with nail-biting tension and a thought provoking ambiguous climax, The Maze Runner is a mega-budget blockbuster that, for much of its running time, moves like molasses, and which ends leaving questions that we know will be answered, just so long as we shell out more cash to see the next couple of instalments.Obviously, at 47 I'm not exactly in the intended demographic for this film, but I do feel that this one missed the opportunity to be a hugely entertaining adventure for all ages. When the characters are in the maze, running for their lives from the grievers (metallic insectoid monsters), or dodging the changing architecture, the film is actually very enjoyable, but far too much time is spent in the relative safety of 'the glade', the idyllic green area at the centre of the maze where the boys first wake up. With my son currently reading the series of books, it's almost certain that I'll have to watch the sequels; I just hope that they make it a little more exciting next time around (and don't cut the film to reduce the UK rating to a 12 certificate. Grrrrrr!).5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,2015,6.3,"After having escaped the Maze, the Gladers now face a new set of challenges on the open roads of a desolate landscape filled with unimaginable obstacles.","To begin with, I have to let you know that I was not aware of the existence of any book before I saw the first and second movie. So, comments like ""you ruined the book"", etc. don't make sense to me.I saw the first movie on a DVD and this one in the movie theater. For me it was pure entertainment for the entire duration of the movie! I liked the thrilling scenes and the chase from the zombie like people. At some points I could not help but thinking that it a PS4 game and at some point they would turn over the control of the actors to me and I would be left alone clicking on X or L1/R1 to run as fast as I can! I liked that but many may not like it. For me this was awesome!The acting was OK, as expected and really similar to the first one. It's not like you wait to see an Oscar-winning performance there, right? I really enjoyed all the special effects and the amazing scenes from the cities that are crumbling and falling apart. The movie seemed a lot longer than it is. The action-packed and full story behind it, gave too much information and left me feeling really ""full"" after watching it and this was not because of the XXL pop corn that I ate!I will go to the movies to see the third one, with excitement! And yes, it definitely is an ""8"" in its genre. ""7"" felt like a minimum, so I would easily give a ""7.5"" with pleasure! If you don't like this kind of post-apocaliptic stories, wait till it's out in DVD, don't spend money in the movies. If you do like them, go and see it, like yesterday!"
Hercules,2014,6.0,"Having endured his legendary twelve labors, Hercules, the Greek demigod, has his life as a sword-for-hire tested when the King of Thrace and his daughter seek his aid in defeating a tyrannical warlord.","Firstly, the film has a slow start. We see almost motion comic footage of Hercules doing his 12 labours in slideshow form, with Hercules face hidden in silhouette. So I felt a little cheated. Then we have a scene which tries to set up what makes this version of the main character different than any other version we have seen before. I wont give it away, as its basically what the film is about. But it tries to play with our knowledge of him.It doesn't ignore the back story of his wife and kids, but glosses over those parts until it becomes necessary to divulge that information. Again, i think it would have been better to see it, rather than be told what happened. I knew his history and so was wondering if they would portray this properly. Instead they do something to set-up a villain for the end which I wont give away. Just know that they do tie up all lose ends as needed, but a prior knowledge of who this character is and what he has done does help the viewer understand his motivations and his life up to this point.Its when the big war starts that you really sit up and start paying attention. Somehow watching the Rock talk doesn't interest you, but when the fighting starts with the epic 200 people battle sequences, you suddenly see where the budget went, the fights are fantastic!What is really great is how Hercules and his band of merry men (and woman) use smarts to outwit the enemy rather than simply use strength each time. That was clever. From the moment of that first fight the film moves up a notch and becomes excellent entertainment.Its a historical film and tries to be serious about its overall message. Dwayne does a good job but he's not going to win any awards for this. The other cast members actions are predictable and sufficient. But don't really add much to the plot. They could have been written out and it would have changed nothing.The running length is long enough to feel satisfied and not so long that it overstays its welcome. The plot twists you see coming a mile away but at least it tries to do them. Other than one characters actions near the end which was so obvious it was stupid to include.In conclusion, its worth watching. It takes it times to grab you, but once it does it doesn't let go. There are a few stretches of how strong Hercules is, but not enough for you to hate it. The 3D has its moments, but like most films I would rather have watched it in 2D as I don't think it made a major difference and its more comfortable not having to wear those glasses with my head upright the entire time."
A Dog's Purpose,2017,7.3,"A dog discovers the meaning of its own existence through the lives of the humans it teaches to laugh and love. Reincarnated as multiple canines over the course of five decades, the lovable pooch develops an unbreakable bond with Ethan.","I prepared myself for this one. I really did. No matter what, I wasn't going to cry. It did take a major mental convincing every time though! But it worked. I didn't cry but I did feel a lump in my throat many times. But I didn't cry even though people were sobbing all around me. I simply focused on the bright side - the dogs! <3 I thought I would leave with a heavy heart but instead, I left with a smile on my face. :) A Dog's Purpose is a beautiful movie. It gets you loving, laughing, crying, and just to the right level, without overdoing it! Don't pay heed to the self proclaimed jury who think they can judge what happened based on an video that was released very timely. I decided to judge the movie based on what it is. And it's simple, beautiful, & true! If anyone has every had a dog, then you should watch it if you ever loved your dog. The ones we rescue, truly rescue us!"
The Huntsman: Winter's War,2016,6.1,"Eric and fellow warrior Sara, raised as members of ice Queen Freya's army, try to conceal their forbidden love as they fight to survive the wicked intentions of both Freya and her sister Ravenna.","The Huntsman: Winters War doesn't work well as a prequel to 'Snow White and the Huntsman' due to a number of anomalies pointed out by others, mainly relating to the lack of Ravenna's brother Finn in her past and the presence of a new sister. However, treat it as a separate film and it's pretty good. Chris Hemsworth plays his part well and Charlize Theron is the fairest of them all, if not the nicest. The special effects are well wrought and the adventure keeps you watching. As in the previous film, the dwarfs provide light entertainment. Enjoyable hokum and great escapism. I enjoyed it."
Captain America: Civil War,2016,7.8,Political involvement in the Avengers' affairs causes a rift between Captain America and Iron Man.,"I'm going to be honest in saying that over the past few months, I've slowly become bored with the constant superhero releases, the current box office seems rife with them, not that that's a bad thing, it's just a tad repetitive. But then there's the Captain America series of the MCU films which seem to venture away from the typical action-packed, over-the-top aesthetics of other superhero films and instead focus more on the drama, the plot, the characters, and instead form a thriller in the style of 'The Manchurian Candidate' or the 'Bourne' films.Personally I was a huge fan of 'The Winter Soldier', abandoning the action to instead create a political thriller was a fantastic idea, and it seems that the Russo's have yet again gone down a similar route in creating a more complex film (that does unfortunately contain plot holes here and there) that instead leaves the audience thinking rather than just presenting mindless action, however 'Civil War' is definitely more ""actiony"" than 'Winter Soldier' was, and unfortunately I dislike the overuse of CGI which this film does contain, but thankfully the interwoven smart plot allowed for some material that'll hopefully be an influence towards other superhero movies, to actually create clever content instead of dumbed-down footage. Definitely one of the stronger Marvel films!"
Papillon,1973,8.0,"A French convict in the 1930s befriends a fellow criminal as the two of them begin serving their sentence in the South American penal colony on Devil's Island, which inspires the man to plot his escape.","The true story of Henri Charriere (nicknamed ""Papillon"" because of his butterfly tattooed chest), a Frenchman falsely accused of murder and sent to French Guiana's inescapable penal colony. Charriere spent years trying to escape from this mosquito-ridden, malaria-prone hellhole, but every attempt somehow went awry. On many occasions, the recaptured Charriere was sent into solitary confinement and only survived thanks to his incredible mental strength. Ultimately, the authorities lost hope of taming his urge to break out, so they abandoned him on Devil's Island, a tiny land mass where guards were not needed since the constantly ferocious surrounding sea was ample deterent for any would-be escapees.Franklin J. Schaffner directs this film quite well, capturing the appalling prison conditions vividly and getting a wonderful, multi-layered performance from Dustin Hoffman as Charriere's friend, convict Louis Dega. However, McQueen struggles with the demands of the lead role. Yes, he's physically accurate in the part and during the escape sequences he looks convincing. However, during the quieter moments, McQueen looks distinctly uncomfortable, and his natural ""cool"" persona doesn't equate with the humiliated, tormented character he is supposed to be playing. The subsidiary characters are great, especially the guy with the tattooed face who attributes his ugly tattoos to an evening of drunkeness, and Anthony Zerbe as a grossly disfigured leper who asks Papillon to share a cigar with him.Best sequence? Probably the one where McQueen and another escapee flee through the rainforest from some soldiers, using natural jungle-based narcotics to preserve their energy levels."
War Dogs,2016,7.1,"Loosely based on the true story of two young men, David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli, who won a three hundred million dollar contract from the Pentagon to arm America's allies in Afghanistan.","The movie starts off narrated, interesting and very cohesive. They do a great job of introducing characters and foreshadowing what is later to come. The characters are very well developed and their relationship especially at the start is funny and light hearted. The acting is great if you like films like ""superbad"" and ""neighbour's"".The plot itself is based off a true story and is really interesting from start to finish. The action is great with slight comedy here and there. It has very wolf of wall street vibes and is a thrill ride.When Bradley Cooper gets involved there is a lot of mystery and suspense. You really don't know whats gonna happen and your interest becomes even greater. The contract part was extremely predictable. The ending was very weird, without spoiling it, someone goes to jail for what seems a really short amount of time considering the crime. Then someone gets given money which is somewhat satisfying. But you really don't get a feeling of revenge or justice.Summary:
Overall I was really surprised at how good this was. Its not just your average comedy. It has great characters, acting, story, and is a blast to watch. Highly recommended."
Collateral Beauty,2016,6.8,"Retreating from life after a tragedy, a man questions the universe by writing to Love, Time, and Death. Receiving unexpected answers, he begins to see how these things interlock and how even loss can reveal moments of meaning and beauty.","Because I really liked this movie. Its a drama...and it was slow to unfold but the message was beautiful. It makes you sad, angry, question...but in the end you learn that ALL those emotions are life and love and I thought the performances portrayed that perfectly. I think you either get that message or you don't. The acting was phenomenal including some real surprise performances. Don't go in expecting cheesy happy ""Christmas miracle"" endings. Don't expect a block-buster big bang edge of your seat thriller....expect a beautiful film that is taking a difficult topic(s) and turning it into a thing of beauty."
Independence Day: Resurgence,2016,5.2,"Two decades after the first Independence Day invasion, Earth is faced with a new extra-Solar threat. But will mankind's new space defenses be enough?","I was looking very much forward to it, since I'm a fan of the original (nostalgia based). 15 minutes into the movie I just knew it was going to be bad.Made by the same director that made the movie 2012, it has the same terrible drama and completely transparent storyline. I'm not even sure if there even is a storyline to this movie.The worst part, aside from all the crying scenes based upon long distance relationships, unresolved father issues and what not, was in fact that the aliens are more primitive than us.You would think that a race with such insane technology have evolved beyond petty and shortsighted impulse driven emotions. It's when you realize that the Queen of the aliens suddenly gets a personal vendetta against a yellow school bus while fighter planes are bombarding her, that the manuscript was written in half an hour in a coffee shop.I really went into this with open eyes and was completely set for loving it, but no. The movie is just pure garbage. I'm sorry..."
Beauty and the Beast,2017,7.1,"A brave, beautiful, and brilliant young woman is imprisoned by a beast in his castle. Despite her fears, she learns to see beyond the beast's hideous exterior and realize the gentle heart of the true prince within him.","First and foremost, this is a movie for children. The original was a movie for children. I'm surprised at so many scathing and very negative reviews I've read here.The sets and costumes are beautiful. The music is classic and treated with respect. It takes a very classic Disney animated film and fleshes it out with additional character development and enhanced songs. Many little Disney princesses will watch it over and over again, just like the original animated version.No movie is perfect, but I found it charming and produced with a great deal of love."
Marley,2008,7.0,"A family learns important life lessons from their adorable, but naughty and neurotic dog.","Though I wasn't quite sure what to expect with ""Marley and Me"", I admit I basically expected it to be a slightly goofy slapstick type comedy centered around a high-strung pooch. I was thinking ""Beethoven"" just replace the St. Bernard with a Labrador.With ""A-list"" players like Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson involved, however, I should have known better.This is an actual movie - a real story about real life and the dog that runs through it (literally and figuratively).The basic story follows Wilson and Aniston as journalists who embark upon their lives as a married couple. Marley comes early on as the puppy no one wants and the marginally insane high-strung pooch who appears throughout to be virtually untrainable (don't tell that to that ""It's Me or the Dog"" gal). Shredding cushions, destroying floors and walls and most everything in between seems to never quite drive them completely mad. Instead of taking him to the pound they soldier through and love their dog and of course he faithfully loves them in return. Like a child, a pet is not someone you just give up on because they are hard to take care of.Children - three, ultimately - come into their lives and John's (Wilson) career continues to advance as he carves a niche as a local columnist. They ultimately move from Florida to Pennsylvania. Even as the marriage has its ups and downs, as Jen (Aniston, sans a character name change) gives up her career to be a mom, as kids are born and grow older, as John struggles with his own career direction Marley remains the constant, always a little crazy, always infusing his peculiar personality into the family dynamic.This is a ""family movie"" in the truest sense - that is, that it is about family, about the reality of being a father, a husband, a wife, a mother, and the obligations and dreams and ambitions we have and often let go for the sake of the greater purpose of raising our children. It is about uncomfortable and often painful sacrifices of our own vision of the future for ourselves and our family. It is about what we give up to ultimately gain far more.Marley in his own way represents that sacrifice - a pet probably not many would take on and keep and engenders a huge challenge to persist in loving and caring for. Therein is a lesson in how to raise kids and how to love each other even when we don't much feel like it.For all its fine, thoughtful, and charming qualities ""Marley and Me"" is not 100% a family movie - there's some swearing (not much - perhaps 5 or 6 times, all relatively tame) and some sexual innuendo but nothing overt. In the end I think it finds a pretty reasonable balance between trying to be a movie that appeals to adults and yet it doesn't kowtow to children either. The dialog and the acting are excellent (Jennifer Aniston is especially good) and whatever Owen does is understated and funny yet he also does serious when he needs to.In any case this is a fine movie that most adults will enjoy for a real character-driven ""dramedy"" (mostly drama, less comedy) and kids say 7 and older will be able to catch most of the finer elements of the script."
Inferno,2016,6.2,Robert Langdon must stop a madman from unleashing a virus that could kill half of the population.,"TL;DR: This movie was good but forgettable. Reading the book beforehand is a positive here and you will want to go see it, but keep expectations down and expect a radically altered story with no lasting impression. If you haven't read the book, prepare to be confused, but it can still be an entertaining ride.Edition watched: 2D IMAXThe largest positive for this movie is Tom Hanks. Hank's role here is a slight departure from how he previously played the role, due to the circumstances that are made apparent from the very beginning (but I won't spoil), and yet he was excellent again as Robert Langdon. Aside from Hanks, the story was muddled but chase-movie action and constant changes of beautiful scenery makes this entertaining if forgettable.I have read the book (and liked it) and I went to see it with 2 people who had not read it.For those who haven't read the book, you should know that this is not like the other 2 Dan Brown movies. Those stories dealt with secrets and puzzles from many years ago (hundreds or thousands in some cases) and they had that Indiana Jones for the art history major feel to them. In this movie, all the puzzles are manufactured by a modern day character in the story, so it almost completely lacks that Indiana Jones feel. Even though I had warned my movie companions about this, both were quite disappointed by this aspect.However, the biggest problem my non-book reading movie companions had was confusion. As someone who knew what was going on, even I felt the way they injected some story elements and then dropped them just as fast was a bit dizzying. Given that this movie was adapted for the screen and had radically altered elements from the book, the handling of the story telling was sub par.Both of my movie companions felt the movie was entertaining but nothing special. One sentence opinion: ""It was OK and I enjoyed it."" and ""It was OK, let's go eat.""For those who have read the book, in my opinion this movie departs radically from the source material. That said, reading the book is an advantage and might be a compelling reason to go see this. Knowing the book-story means you will know what is going on, even through elements that were not in the book and/or were presented poorly (e.g. skin rash). I found the changes made for a better experience since I wasn't just seeing a rehash of what I had read. That said, among several disappointments, I was looking forward to a Vasari Corridor scene and I was very much let down.One thing to note, Dan Brown's message was pretty much lost and I wonder if that was intentional? Even the ending, which in the book was used to punctuate Dan Brown's obvious point, is radically changed in the movie. So while the basic story is similar, the actual take away I left the theater with was very different from the book. I mark this as negative because the book made me think about what I had taken for a given, the movie simply entertained me and went away afterwards.Overall, as someone who read the book, I enjoyed the movie but did feel let down."
Wolf,1994,6.3,Publisher Will Randall becomes a demon wolf and has to fight to keep his job.,"While driving through Vermont, New England, the middle age chief editor Will Randall (Jack Nicholson) hits a wolf with his car. He stops the car to drag the animal out of the road, but the wolf is alive and bites his hand. He goes to the doctor, takes rabies vaccine and the doctor releases him.Will is under stress in her job since the publishing house where he works has been bought by the tough millionaire Raymond Alden (Christopher Plummer) and the employees are expecting downsizing. Will is supported by his wife Charlotte Randall (Kate Nelligan) and his colleague and assistant Stewart Swinton (James Spader).Raymond invites Will to a party at his manor and he offers an unwanted job position in Eastern Europe to him and he learns that he had been betrayed by Stewart, who will occupy his position in the publishing house. Will also meets Raymond's rebel daughter Laura Alden (Michelle Pfeiffer).On the next morning, Will Randall goes to his work and learns that he has acute senses and he feels more competitive and decided to fight for his job. Further he discovers that Charlotte is cheating on him with Stewart and that Laura and he are in love with each other. But Will Randall is becoming a wolf and his transformation changes completely his life.I saw ""Wolf"" for the first time in 1994 and yesterday I saw this film again and I found it better and better than the first time that I saw it. The story perfectly combines drama, horror and romance, with Michelle Pfeiffer very beautiful and a great dispute among the characters performed by Jack Nicholson, James Spader and Christopher Plummer. The conclusion is open to interpretation whether the wild side of Laura Alden is transforming her or the sexual intercourse with Will Randall. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Lobo"" (""Wolf"")"
Dangerous Liaisons,1988,7.5,A scheming widow and her manipulative ex-lover make a bet regarding the corruption of a recently married woman.,"""Dangerous Liaisons"" is this incredible movie that is so under rated. It's the battle of the sexes and this book was written over 200 years ago! I love to know that there was this same problem that we still have to this day. That's why enjoyed ""Dangerous Liaisons"" so much because it proves that we have so many differences from the opposite sexes. Men are usually expected to have sex and with a few clever words destroy women's reputations in minutes, while women have to be careful of sleeping with whom, because it's considered shameful.Glenn Close plays Marquise Isabelle de Merteuil, a proper lady with a secretive double life of sex and wishing to destroy a girl's reputation for revenge on her ex for dumping her for this young lady. She also makes a bet with her closest friend, Vicomte S√©bastien de Valmont played by John Malkovich, that he could not bed a lady of such high stature and morals, in return if he succeeds, he will finally have the conquest he's been dreaming of, bedding Marquise Isabelle. I don't care what people say, this was Glenn's best performance and she was so brilliant. Her speech of ""Dominate your sex and avenge my own"" was perfect and as a woman I rooted for her in the story. She is a tragic figure that was over looked by many as just another slut. Glenn had my sympathy and I agreed with a lot of her dialog.John as Valmont was absolutely perfect, he's not that sexy looking but has such charm and charisma on the screen you believe him as a lady's man. ""It's beyond my control"", he repeats this several times throughout the film and it becomes more darker each and every time he says it to Michelle's character. He does the Marquise a favor of bedding young Cecile to help the Marquise's plan of revenge and does such a good job. It was almost too easy for him, but he has a more difficult task of bedding Madame Marie de Tourvel who is married and has very high morals and standards of God and love. He falls in love with her in the process of getting to know her and is so believable, you can see how it breaks his heart to break her's. But he feels he must stand by his reputation and your own heart goes out to him despite his cruel manors as a ""man"".Michelle Pfeiffer as Marie de Tourvel is so beautiful and elegant and is the only one who knows of Valmont's true side. But she cannot help but fall for his charm and love for her, when she talks to his aunt, this is one of the most true speeches ever in cinema that all women can relate too ""I'm sorry to say this but those who are most worthy of love are never made happy by it. Do you still think men love the way we do? No... men enjoy the happiness they feel. We can only enjoy the happiness we give. They are not capable of devoting themselves exclusively to one person. So to hope to be made happy by love is a certain cause of grief."" That is so incredibly and painfully true that Marie knows better but can't help but give herself to Valmont.Swoosie Kurtz, Uma Thurman, and Mildred Natwick are all so exceptional and amazing as well in the film. They truly bring the story to life and keep it going with their dialog and actions. Keanu? Shudder, his acting is like... how do I put this delicately? I think it's... wood. :) Otherwise, trust me this is one of the best movies of all time. This deserves higher than a 7.6 and should be in the top 250. But it's beyond my control. :D10/10"
Citizen Kane,1941,8.2,"Following the death of publishing tycoon Charles Foster Kane, reporters scramble to uncover the meaning of his final utterance: 'Rosebud.'","Reviewers say 'Citizen Kane' is lauded for its technical innovations and Orson Welles' direction and performance. Its exploration of power, memory, and happiness is widely appreciated. However, some critics find its acting style dated and storytelling fragmented. The film's production controversy and real-life inspirations add intrigue. It remains a significant topic in discussions about cinematic artistry and cultural impact."
Criminal,2016,6.3,A dangerous convict receives an implant containing the memories and skills of a dead CIA agent.,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Criminal"" (2016) is kinda ""been there saw that"" type of flick - nothing original, nothing super exciting, but as a one evening guilty pleasure it does it's job, at least partly.The cast is superb, and everyone did their OK jobs for the material, except for Tommy Lee Jones - this is ""you got to be kidding me"" type of performance - he goes with one facial expression during whole flick, expression that says ""what am i doing here? what is this thing?"".Overall, nice execution and OK story with some fun acting makes this flick work for one boring evening. There is even some descent music in it, the one in the van and the one at very end - closing song was great."

The Duke of Burgundy,2014,6.5,A woman who studies butterflies and moths tests the limits of her relationship with her lesbian lover.,"This film offers astonishing photography: soap bubbles look like iridescent lobes, butterflies and moths are presented like stunning neorealist paintings-the pigment scales on wings, delicate antennae, infinitesimal hairs are all rendered with clarity that will elicit gasps. There is also a series of images that morph from one of the protagonists into a cloud of fluttering butterflies of variegated hues segueing into what might be the greatest montage ever edited. Super closeups of wings flash at increasing speed, leaving the viewer overwhelmed by beauty. Complimenting the superb entomological photography are sweeping shots of lush gardens and vine covered chateau walls. We're this not enough, the interiors in soft intimate lighting would earn due praise.And praise the film has garnered with many top critics assigning The Duke of Burgundy perfect scores. Yet with the feast of visual delights the film serves a story that is as dull as a tarnished penny. The lesbian couple repeat a kind of ritualized dominant and submissive behavior scene after scene with scant variation. The encounters are separated by repetitious scenes of entomology lectures.The only portion of this movie that breaks the wearying dreary repetition is a visit to a woman who crafts fetish devices. This breaks the monotony, but it's difficult not to laugh during an exchange. When the submissive partner is disappointed to exasperation at learning that the equipment she desires cannot be fabricated in time for her birthday, an alternative is suggested. The character flashes with delight of the substitution: ""how about human toilet?""
The sensual scenes are my no measure engaging or erotic. Sure, the filmmaker is presenting the subject in a manner that forbids prurient interest. But it's difficult to think of a film in which the physical expression of affection is so boring. The relationship is static until the very end when one of the women becomes overwrought for reasons that the audience is unable to divine.The exhilarating beauty of the photography serves to point up the colorless plot."
Money Monster,2016,6.5,Financial TV host Lee Gates and his producer Patty are put in an extreme situation when an irate investor takes them and their crew as hostage.,"This is one of few real time films -meaning the flow of events matches the duration of the film- that is quite successful in keeping the viewer's attention all along, and Jodie Foster is very efficient as a director presenting what seems initially a daunting technical subject (how a computer ""glitch"" causes an 800 Million Dollar loss to shareholders in a public traded company) as a dramatic thriller that never looses pace.The cast is excellent, Julia Roberts as the ever conscious producer calculating how each camera angle is best to follow on the unfolding live drama, George Clooney in one of his finest roles as the careless theatrical advice giver of the money program who gradually comes to realize how damaging his show is to the masses (in one particular touching scene he is in the street in NY and sees on-lookers imitating his dance moves on the show, and he becomes aware of what a buffoon he is), and finally Jack O'Connel who is very convincing as the candid investor who really wants to know how ""the system"" works (casting him was an inspired choice, he is not a well-known actor so he adds more credibility to the character he plays, a simple man from the street who looses all his money in Wall Street). None of the main or even secondary characters in the film are one dimensional, they have their problems (like lonely dinners for some) and concerns and values, whether it is the camera man or the public relations lady officer reporting to the big CEO, or even the main police officers in charge, all are multi-dimensional characters and their human aspects are not ignored.Even though the film deals with a serious subject, an eye opener leading one to wonder about the real money monsters out there, it remains an excellent thriller with top class actors."
The Jungle Book,2016,7.3,"After a threat from the tiger Shere Khan forces him to flee the jungle, a man-cub named Mowgli embarks on a journey of self discovery with the help of panther Bagheera and free-spirited bear Baloo.","Favreau's Jungle Book is a marvel. With a Spielbergian sense of magical awe and reverent fear, it's a children's epic that not only stands-up to its legacy, but surpasses it. Giant snakeskins, intense animal battles, and daring escapes from ape kingdoms give the film a scope beyond the animated musical, all while keeping intact its persistent joy. Funny, jaw-dropping, thrilling, grand, and fun, it's an all-cylinders-go cinematic experience on every level. The story of a young man-cub raised by wolves and living amongst the animals of the jungle hasn't changed much, down to the talking beasts. Much like last year's Cinderella, they utilize nostalgia of the beloved product to dive deeper into the story without cynically dismissing it. On top of immersing us into the wilderness through meticulous attention to the smallest of details, the characters are drawn with much more depth. The bratty and paper-thin Mowgli of yesteryear is replaced by a boy with brains and motivation. Played with wide-eyed confidence by newcomer Sethi, we emotionally engage with his adventure. And he's not alone; all characters are given loving attention, specifically the foreboding presence of scary-cool bruiser Sheer Khan. The technical feat of creating photo-realistic animals that convincingly speak and emote is so impressive it feels like a benchmark in CGI. It wouldn't be an overstatement to say this is as groundbreaking and beautiful as any visual effects in years. Favreau and co. manage intense attention to accuracy without shoving it down our throats or overshadowing the story. At the end of the day, under all the computer data, there is a soulful and entertaining tale about life's bare necessity: individuality within community."
Self/less,2015,6.5,"A dying real estate mogul transfers his consciousness into a healthy young body, but soon finds that neither the procedure nor the company that performed it are quite what they seem.","Well I definitely had fun watching Self/less. I was just expecting a mystery thriller but it is more science fiction then mystery. The movie is different from the usual stuff we see. A nice innovative script about what almost everybody would want, immortality. Of course it's only available for the super rich. If it would ever happen in real life that's how it would turn out also. Only the super rich can afford everlasting youth. The movie is very entertaining. You never get bored for one second. A lot of action, a couple twists, and good acting from the whole cast. Ben Kingsley doesn't play a large role at all, it's Ryan Reynolds that has the major role and he does it very well. Self/less deserves a higher rating then it actually has on IMDb. Give it a shot if you like something refreshing."
By the Sea,2015,5.3,A couple tries to repair their marriage while staying at a hotel in France.,"In the 70's, writer Roland (Brad Pitt) and former dancer Vanessa (Angelina Jolie) are in a tired marriage. They hope to rekindle their relationship and his writing in a small seaside town in the south of France. She finds a peep hole and obsesses over their next door neighbor especially L√©a (M√©lanie Laurent).Angelina Jolie continues to try to be a real filmmaker. She seems competent as a director. I don't see any outstanding style but her work is functional. The acting is tired although that's their characters. Her depression needs to be over-dramatized. When depression is depressed, it's depressing to watch. That's mostly in the writing and I don't think Jolie is a good writer. She may have fair concepts but her dialogue does not sing. The flow is stuck in mud. The plot could have gone somewhere compelling. She needs to collaborate with a better writer who could help her work. This has potential but Jolie lacks the skills to exploit."
De Cactusbloem,1969,7.2,"A dentist pretends to be married to avoid commitment, but when he falls for his girlfriend and proposes, he must recruit his lovelorn nurse to pose as his wife.","Florigraphists, fluent in the ""language of flowers"", revealing a symbolic, underlying meaning to sending or receiving floral arrangements, describe cactus flower as a symbol of lust (in Japan), as well as courtship and romance (among Native Americans). All three and many other modest or excessive feelings, relationships, experiences... are nicely wrapped up in a comedy suggesting same symbolism in its title.1969 film ""Cactus Flower"", directed by Gene Saks (who has already introduced us, a year earlier, to another stage play classic adapted for the big screen, Neil Simon's ""The Odd Couple"") is a feel-good movie--based on Abe Burrows' Broadway stage adaptation of its witty French original, Pierre Barillet and Jean-Pieerre Gr√©dy's play ""Fleur de cactus""--scripted by a legendary comedic writer I.A.L. Diamond (who is, among his other memorable works, credited with the screenplay for an all-time favourite comedy ""Some Like It Hot"" (1959)), with impish dentist Walter Matthau, accompanied by his reputable nurse-receptionist Ingrid Bergman, coming across as likable and funny leads, further supported by young and sweet Goldie Hawn, in her Oscar awarded depiction of a-cute-dumb-blond stereotype.Bergman's Stephanie Dickinson, for all her decency and selflessness, is a character who is easy to identify with and root for in her initially seemingly unconscious pursuit of her apparently long suppressed, quietly emerging affection for Matthau's Dr. Julian Winston, a rogue we cannot hate because he behaves like a boy from Mark Twain's novel, or Dennis the menace who has grown up and old, but never out of his mischievous ways. In his no-strings-attached wished for relationship with Hawn's sparkling Toni Simmons, he pretends to be married. However, this new ""fact"" tickles well meant youngster's curiosity, so, surely free spirited, but not unscrupulous as eventual household breaker, Toni, tormented by many unanswered questions becomes--as seen in the introductory scene--suicidal, and... what was meant to be a small ""preventive"" lie asks for more lies, ultimately spiraling out of control.Interaction between the three, further helped with an additional ""accomplice"", Winston-like lovable cad Harvey Greenfield, played by Jack Weston, produces some truly hilarious and--specially when the most believable miss Dickinson is involved--touchy moments for a wide-range audience to enjoy. ""Cactus Flower"" easily stands the test of time and even improves with each repeated viewing.Current year (2011) production ""Just Go with It"", a loose remake of the 1969 original, provides a solid, yet, somewhat inferior entertainment when compared to its predecessor."
Miss Sloane,2016,7.5,"In the high-stakes world of political power-brokers, Elizabeth Sloane is the most sought after and formidable lobbyist in D.C. But when taking on the most powerful opponent of her career, she finds winning may come at too high a price.","Loved it. Jessica is very believable as uptight and smart, her lines are delivered with sharp intensity and she is just darn right sexy.Beautiful sets and cinematography. Cool wardrobes. Excellent whistle blowing. Any film that exposes truths about how massive greed and corruption are is a needed film to see.The hidden message is NOT about gun control, it's about corruption and how deep it goes.Seeing an educated, powerful women with needs also shows realism.The score is also nice.This is a great film and is very underrated!"
The Zero Theorem,2013,6.0,"A hugely talented but socially isolated computer operator is tasked by Management to prove the Zero Theorem: that the universe ends as nothing, rendering life meaningless. But meaning is what he already craves.","I seem to have an accidental tradition of seeing new Terry Gilliam at film festivals. Four years ago, I saw The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus at the Munich Film Festival which had an intro and Q&A by Gilliam, my first time seeing one of my favourite directors in person. It was quite a treat. This time at the London Film Festival I didn't go to the screening he attended, but it goes for any film that you see at a festival that the excited atmosphere enhances the experience. Parnassus held up on DVD and I'm sure The Zero Theorem will too, securing my opinion that he can make at least one great film a decade (since the 70s). Personally, I'm a big fan of Gilliam's bizarre chaotic style, it never fails for me, and this is his best use of it since the wonderfully disorientating Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.Although the outside world can seem more like Ron Howard's vision of The Grinch, as many have complained they didn't buy the retro-world Gilliam created here, I loved the immaculate production design and especially the visual effects for the scenes where our protagonist, Qohen, is trying to solve the theorem in video game-like scenes. This is probably his most on- the-nose existentialistic film yet given its direct and ambitious plot- line, but it's very cleverly and often emotionally done. It's like the incredibly profound reverend speech in Synecdoche, New York expanded to 2 hours about each of our individual purposes in life and how that search of meaning affects our lives. Both Zero and Synecdoche thrive off that irony and they're both brilliantly executed, Zero perhaps not having quite a punch in the gut effect.I loved Christoph Waltz in Inglourious Basterds and quite liked him in Django Unchained, premature second Oscar be damned, but otherwise I'd only seen him in Carnage and I'm still not too confident what he can do in a non-Tarantino film. It wasn't until watching The Zero Theorem where I realised how I'd never seen him play such an emotional character, even if he is very reserved for the most part until a sexual awakening. Unfortunately, his performance feels inconsistent. Sometimes he absolutely nails poignant character-defining scenes and reaches heights of Basterds, albeit at the other end of the scale. Other times, he feels awkward, over- rehearsed and not in the moment. It's quite strange and rather frustrating because his good bits are so good.Perhaps it's mainly due to the writing as its mainly the attempts at slapstick that falter. The script has a running character quirk where he refers to himself as ""we"" or ""us"" as opposed to ""me"" or ""I"" and it's rather confusing as to what it means and puts an unnecessary barrier between us and Qohen when it could be incredibly easy for us to empathise with him. The side characters more than make up for his lopsided parts though. At first they can feel like one- dimensional gag characters, but slowly they develop in an intriguing and welcome way, especially Melanie Thierry and Lucas Hedges' characters. While many of the film's jokes don't really land, David Thewlis is one of the best comedic relief characters in a while and he undeniably has the best lines. Damon and Swinton make delightful appearances too.Along with its existentialism, it has a fascinating theme of sex in the 21st Century with the influence of internet. Thierry's character is a paid tease, 'you can look but you can't touch,' though she has a heart, a good one. But you still can't touch. It certainly hits a nerve for these 'more connected than ever yet more disconnected than ever' times. I would give anything to have the virtual paradise the film offers from Qohen's suit in the poster. The film attempts to have 1984-like themes of government surveillance which aren't as interesting but fortunately after Brazil, it feels like Gilliam's style rather than an NSA reference. Although the first act struggles in tone, it certainly builds to something very rewarding. The Zero Theorem won't be for everyone, but it at the very least offers an interesting answer to the big question, what is the meaning of my life?8/10"
New York Stories,1989,6.4,"A middle-aged artist obsessed with his pretty young assistant, a precocious 12-year-old living in a hotel, and a neurotic lawyer with a possessive mother make up three Gotham tales.","Three 40 minutes short films by three of the greatest American directors; Scorsese, Coppola and Allen. I personally like Scorsese's introducing segment the most, Life Lesson. Even if I personally is not a fan of Nick Nolte, the movie has depth and it's just as good as you would expect from a director like Scorsese. Unlike many other directors, Scorsese manages to capture sexual attraction, in this case felt by the main character (Nolte). Freshly photographed and good ending that makes you recall upon your own life. Not a masterpiece but indeed great.Coppola's segment ""Zoe"" is a total disaster. It is beautifully filmed, but the acting and the story is far below good. Better fit for the children's hour on TV. I don't know if the story was supposed to be ironical, a satire of spoiled extremely rich kids on Manhattan, which could be the fact since there were some scenes where the young girl interacts with a homeless man. That could have been a good theme, if it was Coppola's intention, but no matter the case - it just don't work. It is silly and it doesn't feel satirical at all. Another idea is that it was supposed to be funny, a short comedy, however, neither does it work on that layer. It somewhat makes me lose my respect for the director.Woody Allen's part however is a pleasant refresher after Coppola's borer. Very funny, typical Allen, good acting from Allen's side and good music.Overall rating is a mere 6, dragged down by Coppola. Without his segment I would rate this movie an 8."
Great Expectations,1998,6.8,Modernization of Charles Dickens' classic story finds the hapless Finn as a painter in New York City pursuing his unrequited and haughty childhood love.,"I loved this film, it was simply well made for this modern time. I read the book by Charles Dickens and it is quite different, but very enjoyable.You never know do you? It was a bit confusing, I mean Gwyneth Paltrow's character, I guess you could say she was unique. And I understood Ethan Hawkes character perfectly. Wonderful film, I'd recommend it to anyone."
Parkol√≥,2014,6.7,"Anyone can park wherever they like in the car park, except for one place; the spot where Legionaire, the owner of the lot, buries dead mourning doves. But then a man (Imre) appears who wants to obtain that exact place for his 1968 Ford Mustang - at any cost, and will do almost anything to win. But, who wins in the end?","My first review for a Hungarian movie... I saw in my life a few good films produced in neighboring Hungary (I'm born in Bucharest, Romania, which is frequently confused with Budapest ...) I admire Hungarian filmmakers for their courage in addressing topics banned during communism. This film is made in post-communist time, in 2014 and it has a very simple subject. But the manner in which it treated the subject is very complex. The music is subtle and very effective. The actors are all like extracted from a real slice of life, all of grade 10. In particular, the Hungarian version of Vin Diesel, Ferenc Lengyel. And the Cinematography by Marton Miklauzic is a little bit revolutionary. I recommend it to everybody."
A mi kis falunk,,8.0,"What is life in our little village like? Impossible situations, familiar characters, and a community where nothing works the way it should.","One of the best series so far. Very funny, excellent acting just can't have enough of it. Hopefully more seasons will coming."
The Talented Mr. Ripley,1999,7.4,"In late 1950s New York, a young underachiever named Tom Ripley is sent to Italy to retrieve Dickie Greenleaf, a rich and spoiled millionaire playboy. But when the errand fails, Ripley takes extreme measures.","I'll admit that I rented ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" without the slightest clue about what the story entailed. However, this caused no problem as I soon became involved in the twisted and rather bizarre plot; I was immediately interested in the movie as it was unique and unusual right from the start.Matt Damon portrays the mysterious Mr. Ripley, who, more or less, remains a mystery throughout the film. I was intrigued at how, when you first see him on screen, you are given the impression that he is nothing more than a shy, innocent, and intellectual young man who pretty much keeps to himself. However, this image is only visable for the first five minutes or so, and is virtually shattered once he accepts the offer to go to Italy in search of Mr. Greenleaf's son, Dickie. I was fascinated at how rapidly his personality altered, and suddenly I understood that he was rather odd, as he deceived Mr. Greenleaf in the first place by wearing a Princeton jacket and pretending that he knew Dickie. Now, I haven't explained this entirely, as those of you who have seen this film know, as I am not writing this to create a summary of the plot, but rather to give my comments. Basically, Mr. Greenleaf saw Ripley playing the piano at a wedding wearing a Princeton jacket, and since his son also went to Princeton, he asks Ripley if, by any chance, he knew Dickie. Of course, since Ripley never went to Princeton in the first place, he couldn't possibly have known Dickie. Despite this fact, however, Ripley says that he did know him, and that they were friends. As soon as he says this, he manages to get himself in a deep hole of trouble as Mr. Greenleaf asks him to go to Italy to try and retrieve his son, as he couldn't do it himself due to that fact that Dickie wouldn't listen to his father following a serries of arguments.I thought that the acting was brilliant, especially that of Jude Law (Dickie) and Matt Damon. I was on the edge of my seat throughout most of the film, and I felt that all the characters were believable in their own ways. I believe this to be a splendidly clever story, which is well written and directed. I thought that the music playing during most of the film was excellent as it matched the strange, eerie atmosphere of the story beautifully.I would like to conclude this review by saying that this is a very good movie with an unusually unpredictable ending; it's nice to see a movie that doesn't finish perfectly for a change."
Brazil,1985,7.8,A bureaucrat in a dystopic society becomes an enemy of the state as he pursues the woman of his dreams.,"Sam Lowry works within the huge ministry of information in a near-future world of bureaucracy. A simple administration error leads to the death of an innocent man. Lowry finds himself drawn into a world where he is forced to go against the admin world that he works in with devastating results.This is one of Gilliam's best films (the other being 12 Monkeys). His nightmare vision is complete with wonderful visual touches - some inspired, some very unnerving in their originality. This satire on the world of bureaucracy gone mad has some wonderful elements that don't seem too farfetched - tiny offices, never-ending paperwork, a government so keen to cut costs that people who are arrested are forced to fund their own defence etc. The dream scenes and the romance don't sit too easily beside this element but they help add to the hallucinatory effect of the whole film.The feeling of paranoia runs wild through the film. Everything in it symbolises the uselessness of trying to work against a unbeatable system and the pointlessness of individual effort - witness Tuttle eventually overcome by the ""paperwork"" he once resisted. The only problem with the film is that the plot is mostly rubbish, at first it's hidden but in the middle section and the end the holes become obvious.The cast is mostly excellent despite forced to work with very weird characters. Pryce is brilliant as the quiet bureaucrat pushed into a nightmare by his dreams, although Kim Greist is dull as the focus of his dreams, Jill. The rest of the cast consists of a range of extended cameos including Ian Holm, Michael Palin, Bob Hoskins and an excellent Robert De Niro as a guerrilla heating engineer.The studio bosses wanted an upbeat happy ending to help sales - basically the final 45 seconds had to go. However Gilliam stuck by his guns and produced a film that is visually inspiring whilst being depressingly based in the real world - right up till the final credit has rolled. ""Has anyone seen Lowry?"" - everyone should."
Toni Erdmann,2016,7.3,A practical joking father tries to reconnect with his hard working daughter by creating an outrageous alter ego and posing as her CEO's life coach.,"This is a great movie - but most likely not for everyone. It's about academic upper middle-class people and their family relationships. Not everybody will find that interesting and there is no usual ""romantic"" plot development. It's a family portrait of a father and her daughter and as such has no (plot) conclusion. It is not the usual light comedy since it touches very serious questions and the prevailing mood is unhappiness (it is however _very_ funny at times ;-)).That being said, this movie makes some very fine and subtle observations, presents them in a funny and entertaining form yet at the same time in a thought-provoking and philosophical way which will make you think about it for a long time. If you're from an academic (german) household you will find lots of similarities in your own family relations.This movie is not fast-paced - in fact it often has long shots of lonely people and a lot is not said but has to be filled in by the viewer. So if you don't relate to the characters this movie will feel longish for sure. But if you find traces of your own life or that of your friends and relatives you'll be amazed by the subtlety and finesse in which this movie is directed. Although there are some bizarre events, everything which happens in this movie could happen in real life. There are no implausible scenes in this movie! This is an incredible statement given the crazy and bizarre things which happen in this movie. If you wanna know how that could be true, you might wanna watch it."
Bleed for This,2016,6.8,"The inspirational story of World Champion Boxer Vinny Pazienza who, after a near fatal car crash which left him not knowing if he'd ever walk again, made one of sports' most incredible comebacks.",No spoilers here. I went to a screening last night in Los Angeles for 'Bleed for This'.It's an excellent movie that delivers solid performances from the supporting cast. Oscar nominations abound.Aaron Eckhart comes through with a dead-on take of Kevin Rooney (all the way down to the walk) and should be a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination.Miles Teller shows a depth beyond his years in his portrayal of the Pazmanian Devil.Highly recommend.Gary Randall Craveonline.com
Passengers,2016,7.0,A malfunction in a sleeping pod on a spacecraft traveling to a distant colony planet wakes one passenger 90 years early.,"I enjoyed Passengers a lot. It's not perfect though. The spaceship is beautiful from both the outside and the inside, and you get the impression that future technology is really fantastic. The computer systems are pretty dumb though (including Michael Sheen's android). This is all forgivable though, because if the computers weren't dumb the story wouldn't work.The only part of the film that doesn't really work is the bit in the middle with Laurence Fishburne. I could see three reasons why his character was needed, but it all felt very contrived. He has one important line though, so I can forgive it (just about). I just wish the writers had thought about that part a bit more, as the rest of the film was really great. Chris Pratt, Jennifer Lawrence and Michael Sheen were brilliant too.Passengers is clever, thoughtful, science fiction, and I would highly recommend it."
Behind the Candelabra,2013,7.0,A chronicle of the tempestuous six-year romance between megastar singer Liberace and his young lover Scott Thorson.,"The film is based on the autobiographical novel of the same name by Scott Thorson (with Alex Thorleifson) adapted for the screen by Richard LaGravenese about the tempestuous 6- year relationship between Liberace and his much younger lover Scott Thorson. This film along with SIDE EFFECTS are purported to be Steven Soderbergh's last films he will direct.The cast is very solid. Matt Damon embodies the role of Scott Thorson well - a young apparently bisexual man who has been tossed from foster home to foster home while he does odd jobs (he is 17 years old) tending to animals. In a gay bar he meets Bob Black (Scott Bakula) who takes Scott to a Liberace concert (his first exposure to the mega-star) and to meet Liberace afterwards. There is tension in the air with Liberace's current paramour and performing partner Billy Leatherwood (Cheyenne Jackson) and we soon discover that Liberace (impeccably played by Michael Douglas) only keeps his 'boys' around for a while before his manager Seymour (Dan Ackroyd) gets rid of them with a check. Liberace and Scott find common ground in being needy people without confidants and soon Scott becomes Liberace's next lover. All goes swimmingly until Liberace sees himself on a TV show and sees how aged he has become. He engages plastic surgeon Dr. Jack Startz (Rob Lowe in a very fine performance) to perform a youthful face lift and at the same time convinces Scott to undergo plastic surgery to make him look more like Liberace! And here begins the downfall: Dr. Startz prescribes pain meds to Scott who becomes addicted and moves into heavier drugs, and his behavior, along with Liberace's need for a 'new face' (Boyd Holbrook), signals the breakup of a 6 year relationship - the best relationship either has ever had.There are excellent cameos by Debbie Reynolds as Liberace's mother, Paul Reiser as Scott's lawyer, and others, but the star of the film is in all ways the flamboyant showman Liberace in some of the most interesting outfits ever created. The on screen relationship between Michael Douglas and Matt Damon is entirely credible and neither of these fine actors has a problem with being sexually physical without seeming to be a parody. There are moments that could have been cut, but as Liberace says, less is more and more is wonderful.Grady Harp"
Ghost in the Shell,2017,6.3,"In the near future, Major Mira Killian is the first of her kind: A human saved from a terrible crash, who is cyber-enhanced to be a perfect soldier devoted to stopping the world's most dangerous criminals.","Simplified? Yes.
Stupified? No!
imho a beautifully crafted cyberpunk movie that while it does not reach to the levels of complexity of the original anime, it stand it's ground and deliver a great audiovisual experience with a story that is sophisticated enough to rise above most Hollywood movies today but not that much to alienate more mainstream viewers.
This is greatly underrated because it had to stand in the unfair comparison of the anime. I don't believe it is possible to replicate animes so just go and see it for what it is.
A great cyberpunk Hollywood production. It is rare for Hollywood to treat it's original material with respect while trying to simplify it to reach a bigger audience."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,2017,5.2,"Xander Cage, left for dead after an incident, is recruited back into action for a new assignment, leading a team of death-defying adrenaline junkies.","I don't know where all this hate is coming from or why but personally I really enjoyed the Movie.It doesn't have a very sophisticated Story but that has never been a defining mark of xxx movies. It is a senseless Action movie like many others before it and they never tried to make it something it wasn't. And for what it is (A real feel good movie to watch with friends) it's really good!The Action scenes are thrilling and get you really pumped up, the fight scenes are just overall awesome (especialy Donnie Yen shines through in this regard) and the jokes are quite funny.If your expecting an emotional drama or a movie that takes itself to serious like white house down or whatnot you're wrong.This movie is just some good old fun."
Cinema Verite,,6.5,A behind-the-scenes look at the making of the first American family to be the subjects of a reality TV show.,"In 1971 an all American family from Santa Barbara in California were chosen, seemingly at random, to take part in a TV experiment. It was to become the world's first reality TV show called ""An American Family"" and its stars, the Loud family ‚Äì both by name and at times by nature, were to become national phenomena.But to get to legendary status the show's producer, Craig Gilbert, had a pretty hard sell to the board of TV company PBS who were reluctant, to say the least, to commit to the show and began to baulk at the cost of production as the film stock costs (in particular) began to mount.Their concern was about the ""view-ability"" of the show and whether it would find an audience. They needn't have worried because what gradually emerged was a tale of a swinging misogynist father (Tim Robbins), a hopeless and helpless (but sultry in Gilbert's opinion) Mom played brilliantly by Diane Lane and a screamingly gay son, Lance, played gleefully by Thomas Dekker. Not to mention a looky-likey Rolling Stones band fronted by the other two boys.But it's what's going on in the mind of Producer Gilbert (played masterfully by James Gandolfini with a very unlikely full beard and absolutely no gangster element whatsoever to draw on) that is the meat of the movie. Well, I say a movie but it's actually a documentary set within a drama, about a reality TV documentary that turns out larger than life than any drama.At points we see side by side comparisons between the ""real"" family and the 2011 actors. It's uncanny. Gandolfini manipulates all sides as he makes the ""action"" more and more interesting but in doing so contributes to the family meltdown and the confidence of his crew. It's terrific.I don't think this ever made it to cinema, it's an HBO production, but it's great and I saw it last night on Sky Atlantic so is likely to be repeated at some time. If it is tune in because it's a little gem."
Gold,2016,6.7,"Kenny Wells, a prospector desperate for a lucky break, teams up with a similarly eager geologist and sets off on a journey to find gold in the uncharted jungle of Indonesia.","Longing for the American dream should never be inextricable from the determination of an individual. Dreaming about achieving a goal should go hand in hand with proactively doing it. Without veering off on a transcendentalist tangent, let me introduce Kenny Wells. Wells is a pot-bellied, greased up chain smoking alcoholic, perhaps uncomfortably seen as the heir to the throne of the Washoe Mining Company based in 'the biggest little city in the world' and where Johnny Cash sang of a prisoner shooting a man, 'just to watch him die'. The one and only, Reno, Nevada. So maybe I haven't painted Wells in such a great light so far. He certainly isn't the godchild of Emerson, but that's what director Stephen Gaghan appears to try and convey. This is Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey as you've never witnessed before, presented in a way that's far from an idealised sharp-suited image of the American dreamer and stoically opposed to Ron Woodward's skeletal frame in his winning performance in 2013's 'Dallas Buyers Club'. However, he's the film's gleaming treasure in a somewhat clich√©d quest for glory, even if the main aesthetic shine is only from his forehead in an Indonesian jungle.'Gold' is loosely based upon the Bre-X mining scandal of 1993 with Gaghan confusingly transporting us straight back to the 1980s to a world of questionable suits, post-punk, Iggy Pop and the romantic aspirations of Wells. His journey is somewhat instigated by the death of his father, luring him further into the volatile and unpredictable world of gold mining, conducting the train through its successes and abrupt halts. From the smoky testosterone filled bars of Reno to the sweat inducing tropics of Borneo, we realise how integral McConaughey's performance is to the success and believability of the narrative. Although somewhat charismatic through his wittiness and general naivety to the overall project, Kenny Wells is a man who is out to make money. Wells' sidekick, geologist Michael Acosta (Edgar Ramirez), is bestowed with elements of morality and spirituality, clearly seen in his proactive interaction with the Indonesian people. So therefore, Wells' financial determination combined with Acosta's endearing qualities and intelligence make the relationship such a strong focal point of the film. The strength of the characters makes the adventure seem almost tangible, yet still questionable.Looking at McConaughey's transformation, you may just begin to question how Kaylene (Bryce Dallas-Howard) has fallen for such a downtrodden hopeless wanderer. However it's her innocent undying belief in him that makes Wells' decline even more forceful. There is an essence of the childhood sweetheart in her demeanour, the archetypal support mechanism to Kenny's weaknesses. Yes, she rides on the wave of success to its highest heights with Wells, lavishing herself in material riches but in a way, she is the moral spine of the film, never losing sight of the real Kenny Wells she's grown up loving. Kaylene acts just as much as the voice of reason as Michael Acosta and it is the combination of powerful relationships that we will really take away from the screen. The dizzying heights of financial success ultimately lead to a strenuous, yet somewhat predictable breakdown between Kenny and Kaylene and we can't help but feel like she is completely unworthy of any of it. Whiskey plus money plus the inability to maintain your dignity¬Ö. Well you know the rest. That's not saying Kenny Wells is a vile person, despite his, for want of a better term, shabby look. We're willing everything to work out for both of them, yet the American dream just becomes too much to handle.McConaughey's character compared to the regimental sharp suited Wall Street bankers is a deliberate contrast by Gaghan. Our willingness for the sugar coated American dream to work out is pitted against the cold-hearted capitalist intentions of Brian (Corey Stoll). Wells' resilience to counteract an offer made by Stoll and his legion of top button fastened, tight tied troubadours, can only be admired. The ambition to fight against globalisation, to hold onto your dreams, to recapture lost determination and to let nothing stand in your way in fighting for what you want, is made believable through McConaughey's stellar performance. However, in what should be an adventure full of undying speed to keep up with the lustful desire for success, the film's narrative is too slow to match the pace of Wells' dreams. McConaughey is the glitter in a film without much gold."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,2016,6.2,Jack Reacher must uncover the truth behind a major government conspiracy in order to clear his name while on the run as a fugitive from the law.,"25 October 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester This Afternoon - Jack Reacher Never Go Back. Tom Cruise returns in the title role and plays the hero part with aplomb. The film begins, continues and ends with action and intrigue. In this outing Reacher has to uncover a government conspiracy to clear his name and that of a colleague. A complicated plot entwines itself around the characters and it takes a little concentration not to get lost. There is however a rather refreshing chase scene that doesn't involve a single car. Highly watchable but not as good as the first film. Always easy to watch Tom Cruise when he's strutting his stuff, whatever the plot."
My Date with the President's Daughter,,6.3,"A teenager unwittingly falls for the American President's daughter, and the pair soon find themselves off on a wild adventure.","I have to admit, I was 12 when this came out. I was in love with it. I was the age they were aimed at. I saw this on the Disney channel last night. I thought I would still love it. I have recently discovered that tastes change. And sometimes for the better. Although, I still think it was a cute little comedy. 12 year olds will definitely enjoy it. I wouldn't doubt that. The acting and the story are just a little lame. And of course there always is a message to be learned. Afer all, this was on the Disney channel. But it's better then most of the trash 12 year olds watch today. So, I would suggest it for them.5/10"

Norman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer,2016,6.1,"Norman Oppenheimer is a small time operator who befriends a young politician at a low point in his life. Three years later, when the politician becomes an influential world leader, Norman's life dramatically changes for better and worse.","Joseph Cedar's English-language, U.S.-Israeli co-production starring Richard Gere does not disappoint. Gere does a great job playing the titular role, a Manhattan consultant who has a knack for enticing powerful people. He meets a prominent Israeli politician in New York, and ends up offering to buy him an expensive pair of shoes. Later, the man becomes Prime Minister of Israel, setting the stage for major conflict. The script in this film is excellent. It is both witty and sophisticated at the same time, perfectly blending complexity and playfulness. Such a blend also manifests itself in the film's tone, which is handled very well given the film's themes and subject matter. If there's one complaint I have about this film, it is that of the pacing: the four-act structure of the film could have been paced better, as the second and third acts seem to have relatively little substance relative to the rest of the film. Other than that fairly minor complaint, this is most certainly a great film. Definitely recommended. 8.5/10"
Mindenki,2016,8.0,"'Sing' is a childhood drama with a lot of music, set in 1990s Budapest, Hungary. Inspired by a true story, it follows an award winning school choir and the new girl in class who just might uncover the ugly secret behind their fame.","Mindenki (""Sing"") offers a window into the heart and soul of a friendship and loyalty, of fairness and justice through the eyes of a young Hungarian girl. The film does beautifully with its use of choir and music, thus reinforcing emotions and the gravitas to the symbolism and tension between silence and freedom of speech, a theme that runs implicitly through the film. And still, ""Sing"" also offers a sweet, reminiscent look into child's play and the power of art and of fairness as primary for children. A beautiful, must-see, and redemptive film, sure to touch any or all who have also felt silenced and who needed a friend at times. A joy and a masterpiece of Hungarian cinema."
Tiszta sz√≠vvel,2016,7.1,"Two disabled teenagers looking for meaning in their lives, team up with a wheelchair hit-man.","A movie that was made in the wrong genre. It's not a drama, it's a bad documentary. Disturbing subplots obscure the point and frustrate the viewer. The film is based on short life situations presented one after the other. The topic is the vulnerability of people with disabilities. It is surprising that even those living on the periphery of society exploit them to the extreme. In various ways and purposes, with underworld means. Abandoning the classical literary structure did not work, and the plot's main line is therefore missing. The character portrayals are well done, this is one of the few positives of the film. The creators use too many tools for this stripped-down theme and could add little to the well-known ideas!"

The engaging soundtrack and cast chemistry are praised, though some find the humor repetitive and the plot less cohesive than the first film. Despite these criticisms, the sequel is generally well-received for its entertaining value and emotional moments."
The Legend of Tarzan,2016,6.2,"Tarzan, having acclimated to life in London, is called back to his former home in the jungle to investigate the activities at a mining encampment.","Many people today can argue, that Tarzan is somewhat a forgotten character and property. I believe, that kids today, are not all that familiar with the character Tarzan. So it was a matter of time, that one day we would get a reboot. That kids would get schooled on Tarzan, keep it fresh for the people. I believe that this movie does a good job of keeping the character, & the legend of Tarzan fresh.In this tale of Tarzan, we don't get the wild man version at first. We get an older, more civilized, easy going man. Who has left his old lifestyle behind him. But things don't stay this way forever. Tarzan is trying to keep his cool, but Leon Rom played by Christoph Waltz (Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained) has to go around, and mess with Tarzan's homeland. By stealing diamonds, and killing people. At first, Tarzan doesn't seem interested in helping. However, a former civil war fighter, Samuel L. Jackson (According to Ted in Ted 2. If you've seen any movie ever he's the black guy) is basically saying ""You have to save them...Motherfu#ker!""From the trailers, and T.V. spots, I was expecting the tone of Tarzan to be very dark and gritty. But, it's not that dark. In my opinion this movie has two very different tones. We have some dark and dangerous visuals of the jungle, and Samuel L. Jackson brings the comedy to this movie. Samuel L. Jackson was awesome as always. He really did a fantastic job at delivering the comedy. I literally laughed like the joker when he said ""You want me to lick his nuts too?"" (referring to the Gorillas nuts) This was okay at times, but it sort of felt like two different people directing at times.This film has some very snazzy visuals, and beautiful cinematography of the jungle. I'm not sure if they traveled to Africa to film. Nonetheless, if the didn't it is because they really didn't need to go. Everything looked very real, and it really is gorgeous scenery throughout the film.Also, the wardrobe was fantastic. Whoever did, the wardrobe, and makeup design should get some serious praise. Djimon Hounsou (Blood Diamond, Furious 7) looked like a badass, along with his tribe. Even Marvels Black Panther, would look at them like damn, you guys bad.Surprisingly, my only real complaints about the film are the performances by Christoph Waltz, and Jane, played by Margot Robbie (The Wolf of Wall Street, Suicide Squad). I believe that Margot Robbie delivered a good performance. However, the way the character was written, could have been more interesting. She could have been more of a bad-ass chick, like we all know she can be, and not be underused. Christoph Waltz as well, could have been written just a little bit better. In my opinion, he will go down in history as an actor famous playing villainous roles. However, this role, came off to me as a little cartoonish.So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on the Legend of Tarzan. Superhero movies are very popular at the moment, and this movie does a good job at making Tarzan feel like a superhero. It keeps the character fresh, and interesting. Tarzan is fun for the moment, but sadly I don't think i will remember it a couple of months from now. I would love to see it again, on T.V. or streaming. That doesn't mean it is a bad film; it's just not a perfect film. It has it's moments, and I love the films message. On how know matter what you do, your past is a part of you. At the end of the day it was fun, and as Phil Collins once sang, ""You'll be in my heart"". I believe The Legend of Tarzan earns a...7/10.This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you for reading/viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. :)"
Trumbo,2015,7.4,"In 1947, Dalton Trumbo was Hollywood's top screenwriter, until he and other artists were jailed and blacklisted for their political beliefs.","Trumbo is a period piece set in the late 40s and early 50s, following the life of Dalton Trumbo, arguably the leader of the Hollywood 10 who stood up to congress over what they saw as the illegal investigation and censorship of people's beliefs and free speech during the Second Red Scare after WWII. At the time, Congress and, in turn, members of the Hollywood elite blackballed writers, actors, directors, etc who identified as communists. Not spies for Moscow, but communists by political belief. Some faced jail time. Some lost their homes because they could not find work. Others encountered harsher realities. And Hollywood witch-hunt was merely a small part of a more wide-spread affront to civil liberties.The time period itself is difficult to portray without seeming to be caricature - or perhaps style and communication have changed so much in 65 years that it just seems like caricature. Added to that difficulty are portrayals of John Wayne and Kirk Douglas, legends of film that, as a young person, I may have gone my whole life subconsciously thinking of as only existing on screen. Trumbo mostly rises to the occasion.Much of Trumbo is comedic, and with intention, but the film also carries a certain amount of poignancy, if maybe a little less than it could use given the subject matter. Bryan Cranston is incredibly enjoyable to watch, and during the credits you get to watch a clip of the real Trumbo to compare. The portrayal is jarringly realistic (something you may question for the entirety of the film). Helen Mirren is a worthy antagonist, and very effectively displays the fear and anger that result from war - the need to dehumanize the enemy in order to survive the loss you feel as your family is fighting thousands of miles across the world, the need to justify pain through rigid ideology.Other notable performances come from Michael Stuhlbarg, whose character, Eddie, provides for much of the films poignancy, and Diane Lane as the quiet but strong Cleo Trumbo, the rock of her family. John Goodman, is well cast as the comedic used car salesman of film, and Elle Fanning makes her mark as the rebellious daughter learning to be every bit of a force as her father.It would be unfair to pin the failings of the film on a single person, but Louis C. K. continues to prove that being a great comedian does not make you a great actor. His portrayal is, in fact, so flat that it pulls you out of immersion in the film, a flaw that is further exacerbated by Bryan Cranston's mastery. Scenes between the two are simply absurd.As a whole, the film's laughs are well earned and its feelings are well felt. Where the film falls short is to evoke, without personal reflection, the so obvious parallels between the state of our country today and that of the film. But perhaps that is not the goal. Perhaps the goal was to, with a bit of fun, portray a larger than life writer who decided to take on the world...and won. In that, Trumbo is a great success."

Er ist wieder da,2015,7.0,"Adolf Hitler wakes up in the 21st century. He quickly gains media attention, but while Germany finds him hilarious and charming, Hitler makes some serious observations about society.","""Even Poland still exists! This war has been useless!"" erupts Adolf Hitler not too long after the movie has started. This is one of the many instances one has to fight the urge to spit one's drink all over the place. A fish out of water if there was ever one, Look Who's Back puts an outrageous twist on the stuff of legend (Elvis not dead, neither Marylin, or MJ) and precipitates a resurrected Hitler in contemporary Germany. The F√ºrher still thinks he's on command; harsh reality quickly enlightens him: he is a laughing stock, with a future in stand up comic.This movie is way better that it should be, a miracle walk on a very, very tight rope. The first reason is of course the delightful performance of Oliver Masucci, unrecognisable behind his moustache. Compared to him, the rest of the cast is a bit run-of-the-mill, but most of the scenes involving public appearances have been improvised, and what the common German people have to say about a Hitler comeback is as hilarious as it is frightening.What could have been a series of vignettes √† la Sacha Baron Cohen takes the trouble of developing a plot and various characters, to whom Hitler reacts with a mix of genuine passion for ""the German people"" and a sly denial of anything racist or xenophobic. He's the perfect politician, with an answer to any question and at least three escape routes planned for any quagmire.Carefully editing a mix of newsreel (the Angela Merkel cameo, gratified with ""the charisma of a cold noodle"", is priceless), movie references (the Leni Riefenstahl opening title, the now-iconic Bruno Ganz' bunker scene, except it's oh so cleverly attributed to the villain of the piece) and guerrilla-style impromptu meetings, Look Who's Back manages to balance serious issues (far too many to list) and fleeting fads shedding a cruel light on our social networking culture. From an online ""Adolf Hitler make- up tutorial"" to a ""I hate everyone but Hitler"" tweet and the demonstration that Facebook is useless at recruiting Hitler Jungen, naturally springs the conclusion ‚Äì it shames one to write it ‚Äì that ""no one ever stay mad at Hitler for very long"".Chaplin's The Great Dictator was a brave movie because it was fighting on the front of an ugly war. Look Who's Back adapts this sense of emergency and combativeness to our desperately stupid modern times. The worst thing Hitler can do is kill a puppy. Gasing whole families was ""all a joke"", as asserted by the latest generation of one of said families.What to think of the world we live in, the duty of memory, the atrocities that constellated the 20th century, when one pees itself watching the most reviled person in history punctuating his nazi salute by the phrase ""See you soon, Nigga""? If this blog has a meaning at all, it has found his first authentic modern monster. Bad news is it's a real one; good news is it's desperately funny."

Leaving Las Vegas,1995,7.5,"Ben Sanderson, a Hollywood screenwriter who lost everything because of his alcoholism, arrives in Las Vegas to drink himself to death. There, he meets and forms an uneasy friendship and non-interference pact with prostitute Sera.","""Leaving Las Vegas"" is an insightful, harrowing experience about the binding forces of true romance, the power of encouragement and compassion, and the tragic effects of alcoholism. The performances are absolutely astounding: Nicholas Cage delivers one of the most unforgettable, genuine, and human performances ever captured on film (a well-deserved Oscar for every reason), and Elisabeth Shue, as his soul provider and protector through the trauma of his alcoholic turmoil is sentimental, passionate, and definitely deserving of the Oscar for Best Actress in 1995, providing us with the eye of Ben Sanderson's heart and soul, as his equally troubled lover who has pledged to stay with him through tears and trials. Director Mike Figgis is intensely effective in following the many turmoils of Sanderson as he copes with terminal alcoholism, even going so far as to declaring he will ""drink himself to death in Las Vegas"", and the effects of his struggle upon his functions, health, and spirit, as well as the corresponding attributes of his loyal lover, Sara. I'm certain that anyone who has experienced the turmoil of alcoholism or has been deeply involved with such an abuser will gravely appreciate the realism and depth of this film to address the egregious effects of drinking constantly, and how this alcoholism tears many lives literally apart. I was horrified by Sanderson's dependence upon alcoholism as a substitute for happiness and control, and Nicholas Cage's uncanny human performance, with all of his appropriate, convincing twitches and erratic movements, enhanced the compassion and torment I felt for this character, who has literally surrendered his life to this terrible disease of alcoholism. We gasp in horror as we see Sanderson taking a shower with a bottle of gin in hand, and trembling to the refrigerator for a bottle of vodka: these are the true, tragic symptoms of alcoholism, and this film does an excellent job in addressing them. A brilliant, tragic, yet extremely essential study of the disease of alcoholism and how it can destroy every aspiration, every desire, and every state of consciousness we have within ourselves, when we are constantly craving ""one more bottle of vodka"" 24 hours a day, 7 days a week... Nicholas Cage delivers one of the most heartfelt and eerily convincing performances in the history of film, and this is one lamentable, subliminal look at one of the saddest and unnecessary addictions in humans: striving to either enhance, better, or in this case, destroy their lives in constantly drinking intoxicating and deadly substances. Sanderson to Sara: ""You can never make me stop drinking""--- the sad, yet frighteningly real state of mind of a disparaged, hopeless, alcoholic. **** out of ****"

Kennedy, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis fights through grief and trauma to regain her faith, console her children, and define her husband's historic legacy.","As the film is titled 'Jackie' you expect to learn more about her through the film, it should have been called 'JFK's widow one week following his assassination'. This is a woman who was powerful and had a background, a life, buried two babies. All we get from this film is a portrayal of a grieving, often selfish and self absorbed woman who smokes and drinks too much. Who wouldn't fall to that after something as traumatic? The film is flat and bland, it gives us no indication of the type of woman she was, her role in white house (aside from her expensive renovations and insistence on a huge funeral for her husband) We see nothing of her personal achievements. Natalie Portman and the excellent cast's acting skills are the only interesting thing to watch. Disappointing and does 'Jackie O' no justice at all."
Raging Bull,1980,8.1,"The life of boxer Jake LaMotta, whose violence and temper that led him to the top in the ring destroyed his life outside of it.","Reviewers say 'Raging Bull' is acclaimed for Robert De Niro's transformative performance and Martin Scorsese's direction. The film delves into jealousy, rage, and self-destruction through Jake LaMotta's life. Critics laud the black-and-white cinematography, editing, and boxing scenes. Some find the focus on LaMotta's negative traits and repetitive structure challenging. Initially met with mixed reactions, it is now hailed as a masterpiece for its artistic and technical excellence."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge,2017,6.5,Captain Jack Sparrow searches for the Trident of Poseidon to rule the sea while being pursued by old rival Captain Salazar and a crew of deadly ghosts who have escaped from the Devil's Triangle.,"With poor plotting, inconsistent pacing and a rushed sense of chemistry amongst the new cast Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales exposes the swashbuckling sequel as nothing more than a cash-grab that's as hollow as the ships they occupy."
Bad Santa,2003,7.0,A miserable conman and his partner pose as Santa and his Little Helper to rob department stores on Christmas Eve. But they run into problems when the conman befriends a troubled kid.,"Willie, a grumpy drunk, and Marcus, a dwarf, work together as Santa and his Christmas elf in shopping malls. This is not for the love of the Christmas season but because they plan to rob the mall when the safe is full of Christmas takings. Each year they change names and cities. This year they are in Phoenix. Willie is drinking more than ever, swearing in front of the children and having sex in the changing rooms... Marcus thinks all of this is unprofessional as it nearly gets them fired before they can rob the mall. The manager asks the head of security to investigate. While on duty Willie is visited by a child named Thurman who seems to actually think he is Santa... which proves handy when Willie needs a place to stay! Before the day of the robbery Willie gets together with Sue, an attractive barmaid with a Santa fetish and helps Thurman deal with some bullies.If you are after a Christmas movie for all of the family this is most definitely not it! Our protagonist is not only a criminal but also a total degenerate whose behaviour is almost always inappropriate. If you are not easily offended there are laughs to be had from start to finish. Most of these come from Billy Bob Thornton's eponymous 'Bad Santa'; he does a fantastic job making the character sleazy but without making him unlikeable. Tony Cox is solid as Marcus; Brett Kelly is great as Thurman, a character I initially feared would be annoying, and Lauren Graham was likeable as Sue. The story moves at a good pace with none of the scenes being dragged on too long. There are one or two surprises before the end but nothing that felt unlikely. Overall I'd definitely recommend this as an antidote to all those saccharine Christmas moves."
A Cure for Wellness,2016,6.4,A stockbroker unravels the terrifying secrets of a mysterious Swiss spa where guests never leave.,"Lockhart (Dane DeHaan) is a corrupted young executive. The board is pushing for a merger and they send Lockhart to retrieve CEO Pembroke from a mysterious wellness center in remote Swiss Alps. Both the board and Lockhart agree to pin his indiscretion on Pembroke. Upon arriving, Lockhart senses some strangeness from Dr. Volmer (Jason Isaacs) and the various people. He gets into a car accident with a deer and wakes up with a cast on his leg being cared for in the wellness center. He is taken with strange beauty Hannah.I find the brooding moodiness intriguing. I love the body horror aspects. It could have stayed a simple horror which would be much better. It goes off into some slightly questionable directions. It should be much harder for Lockhart to leave the hospital. The tension would be higher if he's forced to stay. Trying to escape is a great way to raise the intensity. The movie plays with the reliability of Lockhart's perception but that could be sharper. DeHaan as a lead continues to struggle with a tinge of personal demon. Overall, I love the mood and the style but the story could be improved."
X-Men: Apocalypse,2016,6.8,"In the 1980s, the X-Men must defeat an ancient all-powerful mutant, En Sabah Nur, who intends to thrive by bringing destruction to the world.","Reviewers say 'X-Men: Apocalypse' received mixed reviews, praising action sequences, special effects, and standout performances by Michael Fassbender and Evan Peters. Criticisms include pacing issues, a convoluted plot, and underdeveloped characters. Apocalypse, the villain, was deemed underwhelming. The film's reliance on fan service and failure to match previous installments like 'Days of Future Past' were noted. Despite these flaws, many acknowledged its entertainment value and potential to set up future X-Men storylines."
Fences,2016,7.2,"A working-class African-American father tries to raise his family in the 1950s, while coming to terms with the events of his life.","I would give this film a good 7.5 out of 10 stars. I read some mixed reviews about this film and I'm on the side that says it's good, a bit long for what it was trying to deliver, but good. This film didn't need all of the thrills or heavy duty suspense to stay afloat. With brilliant and top notch actors like Denzel Washington and Viola Davis playing the leads their performances alone will make this film something worth seeing. Being that this film is from a stage play it's almost as if this were just a stage play done on a movie set, that's probably why it had so many bad reviews but I think the director (Denzel Washington) wanted it that way. This is purely a drama film delivered well by some of the most brilliant acting I have ever seen. I must admit, it does take a little while for the story to get good but it's well worth the wait. If you're into drama filled experiences with lots of symbolism and good acting I highly recommend this film."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,2015,7.2,"In the early 1960s, CIA agent Napoleon Solo and KGB operative Illya Kuryakin participate in a joint mission against a mysterious criminal organization, which is working to proliferate nuclear weapons.","I just saw a sneak preview of this movie and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it. I will have to preface this review by saying that I have not seen the original show, so I can't say whether this paid appropriate homage to the original, or if it is a bastardization.The opening sequence chase scene featured heavily in the previews, but surprisingly the trailer did not ruin the scene. It actually came across even more crisp and clever in the theater and was a great beginning for the movie. It perfectly sets the tone of the two spy characters and establishes their respectful rivalry.The movie isn't wall-to-wall action, but there are enough action scenes to keep the pace lively. There is also a second chase scene towards the end of the movie that is perhaps even better than the opening scene's chase.I think the real strength of the movie is the comedic element. The banter is quite snappy and a few of the lines I couldn't hear because of the laughter filling the theater. In particular Henry Cavill delivered as the slick cool spy Solo.Armie Hammer also delivered as the Russian counterpart, Illya. In many ways he plays the straight man to Cavill's comedian, which is actually the harder part to play. It was also apparently the harder part to direct and/or film since a few of his scenes came across as a bit clich√©d.The third part of the group is Gaby, played by Alicia Vikander. The part she played is the most uneven of the group. To an extent it seemed like they couldn't quite figure out her role, so she ended up being a bit of a third wheel. That being said, she didn't detract from the movie, and serves as another foil for the two main characters.As long as I'm mentioning actors/actresses, I have to say that Hugh Grant did a superb job in a relatively minor role. Also Elizabeth Debicki did an excellent job as the female villain.Since this is a period piece, I think it's important to point out that they went through a lot of effort to get things right. Fortunately for me, they did such a good job that it, that it didn't feel like I was being beaten over the head with the 60's. There were a number of iconic outfits, but overall it was subtle enough that I wasn't jarred out of the movie, which says a lot about the great job they did.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and would recommend it for anyone who enjoys spy movies, or action/comedies. Also, if you've seen the trailer and thought it showed promise, then you should definitely see the movie, because the trailer doesn't show all (or even most) of the good parts, but gives a good sampling."
Maverick,1994,7.0,"Bret Maverick, needing money for a poker tournament, faces various comic mishaps and challenges, including a charming woman thief.","A good mix of comedy, drama, suspense and nice scenery all make this a pleasing viewing experience. (Most people watching this leave with a smile on their face.)This ""western"" is really a lot more of a comedy, but so was the TV show on which it was based. In the movie, we get some really neat twists at the end, too. Kudos also for including TV's original ""Maverick"" - James Garner - in this film.Mel Gibson (the ""new"" Maverick) and Jodie Foster play off each other well in the leads and Graham Greene has some very funny lines as a supporting player. Alfred Molina, James Coburn, Geoffrey Lewis also shine in supporting performances and it is really fun to see all the cameo appearances in here. Included in there were a couple of old-time western movie stars along with country-western singers, all at a big card game at the end.Another plus are the two songs during the ending credits. There is rousing C&W rendition of ""Amazing Grace"" followed by a good Randy Newman song called ""Ride Gambler Ride."" They are worth sticking around and hearing.One negative about this film: the message seems to be that cheating, lying and just being a dishonorable person if okay if you can get away with it!! (Only in Hollywood!)"
Hannah and Her Sisters,1986,7.8,"Between two Thanksgivings two years apart, Hannah's husband falls in love with her sister Lee, while her hypochondriac ex-husband rekindles his relationship with her sister Holly.","While I am a Woody Allen fanatic, I'm not sure if I agree with the minority of Woody fans who claim this is his best film, instead of ""Annie Hall"". Sure, I would be quick to elect ""Annie"" as Woody's best, but then I regard ""Manhattan"", ""Stardust Memories"", ""Crimes & Misdemeanors"", as well as ""Hannah And Her Sisters"", and I become unsure.  This is certainly one of Woody's most mature films, and I would freely place it in my top five of Woody's works.  It nicely balances comedy with drama, and it also began a new era of high accomplishment for Woody.  Functioning as an ensemble drama loosely organized around three sisters, ""Hannah"" chronicles several stories at once.  The film has an incredibly warm, intimate feeling about it, as people talk in their earth-toned apartments over J.S. Bach or stroll through the city's crisp autumn air.  What rings most true about this film is that it doesn't end quite the way you thought it would (the words ""too tidy"" and ""unpunished"" get unfairly used a lot), yet it ends as it should.Ironically, Hannah (played by Mia Farrow) doesn't fare too deeply in the film.  The eldest of three, she's the family matriarch soothing her aging parents, a showbiz couple reluctantly settling into old age and blaming each other for it.  Her husband Elliot (Michael Caine expertly stuttering & flushing) is consumed with guilt over his heavy crush on Hannah's sensuous, down-to-earth sister, Lee.  Lee is slowly pulling away from her failing relationship with Frederick (the always excellent Max Von Sydow), a horribly misanthropic curmudgeon whose reliance on her as his last link to humanity becomes suffocating.  The youngest sister, Holly (Dianne Wiest - kicking ass as usual), is a nervous, impatient actress whose insecurity and lack of success lead to competing with her best friend April over work and men. Meanwhile, Hannah's ex-husband Mickey (Woody), a severe hypochondriac, is trying desperately to accept his eventual mortality and still find some meaning in life, which it what it seems all the other characters are trying to do.  I won't say where the stories are going or where they all end up, but I will say the ensemble cast is all-around great, Michael Caine and Dianne Wiest are definitely the stand-outs here (their Oscars were well-deserved), but Max Von Sydow and Barbara Hershey do quite fine as well. As for Woody - Mickey is the kind of character that fans were probably waiting for him to play for years, and he pulls it off with his classic ticks & twitches.Woody's evident genius is shown here by juggling the separate stories back & forth so fluidly.  Most attention seems to be focused on Elliot and Lee during the first half (both conflicted & confused), while the second half slightly centers around Mickey and Holly (both nervous & unsure).  Mickey operates mostly as an outsider and the strength of his story doesn't pertain too much to ""the sisters"" (although there are two hysterical flashbacks sequences, one involving Hannah and the other detailing a disastrous date with Holly).  Another masterstroke on Woody's part are the internal voice-overs.  Woody is too smart to know that there are certain thoughts a person has that will exist only in their head, and extracting these feelings into some kind of dialogue with another person would seem forced.  It's casual pacing, novelistic endeavors, vivid characters, cozy settings, heartfelt music and sharp, candid dialogue are what makes this film hold up beautifully for me after dozens of viewings.  It's an absolute Woody Allen film."
Anna and the King,1999,6.7,"The story of the romance between the King of Siam and widowed British schoolteacher, Anna Leonowens, during the 1860s.","This is a masterful piece of filmmaking that over romanticizes a true story to improve its entertainment value.  However, the generous use of artistic license can be almost completely forgiven because the final product is so pleasing.  Director Andy Tennant weaves together resplendent visual images, wonderfully warm lighting, magnificent set design, breathtaking locations and beautiful costumes to produce a banquet of sensory delight.  I'm surprised this film didn't get more technical awards, since it was one of the most exhilarating filmmaking experiences I had all year.The story was engaging, though admittedly the characters were overly idealized.  This is especially true of King Mongkut, who was far more educated, dashing and genteel than it would have been reasonable to expect. Also, the romantic overtones between him and Anna were a bit much.  But the way they were presented enhanced the overall effect so I have difficulty being too critical.The story also had some constructive subtleties.  In addition to the obvious storylines about the education of the children, the effect Anna was having on the King and the impending war, there was a deeper message.  It illustrated the truism that exposure to different peoples and cultures can help us to grow in understanding not only of them, but of ourselves as well. For it was clear that Anna was as much changed by Siam and the King as he and the children were by her.I was highly impressed with the performance turned in by Yun-Fat Chow.  His English is much improved since my last viewing of him in ¬ëReplacement Killers' and ¬ëThe Corruptor'.  He imbued King Mongkut with dignity and strength without forsaking the human side.  The camera just eats him up.  It is easy to see why he has been the dominating force in eastern films for years.Jodie Foster, on the other hand, was off her game.  She was good as Anna, but frankly, we've come to expect more from her.  Foster is a powerful actor who didn't seem quite sure what to do with this character.  In some scenes she rose to the occasion and gave us the Anna we hoped for; resolute, defiant, opinionated and principled.  At other times she seemed tentative and totally intimidated by the role, just limping through her lines.  I give her high marks for her English accent, but her total performance just wasn't up to her capabilities.This was one of the most entertaining and delightful films I've seen this year.  Yes, liberties were taken but I am inclined to overlook them.  It was beautifully filmed and directed; a feast for the senses.  I rated it a 9/10. I highly recommend it."
The Intern,2015,7.1,"Seventy-year-old widower Ben Whittaker has discovered that retirement isn't all it's cracked up to be. Seizing an opportunity to get back in the game, he becomes a senior intern at an online fashion site, founded and run by Jules Ostin.","I caught an advance screening of this last night. The theater was close to being packed with men, woman and children. The movie was surprisingly quite funny; didn't know anything about it before viewing. The entire theater ended up cracking up numerous times. There were various times I felt bad for De Niro's character, but he was optimistic and didn't let it effect him, so it was great. There were a couple of instances I would have never guessed things about the movie. There is one scenario in the story that is tough; what would you do if put in that circumstance. I believe ages 20-80 can relate to this movie. We had De Niro's aspect as well as Hathaway's. Good storyline. The ""Intern"" group of guys were funny too. I'd see this again."
The Circle,2017,5.4,"A woman lands a dream job at a powerful tech company called the Circle, only to uncover an agenda that will affect the lives of all of humanity.","I don't get it, how did this movie end the way it did? What was that? The story was built up but never ended, it's like it's just half a movie.The movie is a waste of time simply because it doesn't go anywhere. They create a scene, introduce characters, start the narrative and then, out of nowhere, it just ends.Did the crew forget a bunch of pages from the script in the printer?Another question is, how is it a thriller? Maybe back in 2017 the scene in itself was horrifying (no it was not). Anyways, here on Earth in 2023 companies as the Circle are mandane and the whole set up is not enough to thrill anyone.I loved Karen Gillan here, heck, the whole cast was good, the idea and teased moral is timeless, but the plot is a total mess. It's a pity though because it felt like it led somewhere."
Silence,2016,7.2,"In the 17th century, two Portuguese Jesuit priests travel to Japan in an attempt to locate their mentor, who is rumored to have committed apostasy, and to propagate Catholicism.","This was Martin Scorsese's passion project. The reason he waited so long was because he didn't feel like he was ready. But when he finally made it, it bombed. Silence is a deconstruction and an examination of faith and spirituality. It's long, patient, quiet, slow. Thus, by the end of the film you will be exhausted. Andrew Garfield gives one his best performances, watching his soul gradually crumble was nothing short of heartbreaking. Adam Driver and Liam Neeson were great as well. Silence is a film not to be played as background noise. It's very hard to watch at points. But if your patient and committed to view it in it's entirety, you'll find something immensely rewarding. Silence is Scorsese's most underrated film, as well as one of the most underrated films of the 21st century."
Transformers: The Last Knight,2017,5.2,"A deadly threat from Earth's history reappears and a hunt for a lost artifact takes place between Autobots and Decepticons, while Optimus Prime encounters his creator in space.","Like all the other sequence, the visual effect is good, which is of course expected. However, the splendid visual effect cannot save an unreasonable screenplay with particularly fragmental shots and scenes.There are countless flaws in the plots and poorly actings:
1. the self-righteous scientists, their smug parts have 0 contributions to the movie. 
2. Cade, what's wrong with Mark Wahlberg? First time acting? Especially his tone is NOT convincing at all. He really needs to work on his facial expressions and tones. (or perhaps his shots are so fragmental? )
3. the car chasing part in London city is to make audience excited or dizzy/faint? 
...After 30 minutes, all i want is to skip to the end.The last straw that makes the whole movie doomed is Optimus' line: earth is my home.
There is no need spending 150 mins on this movie."
Paddington 2,2017,7.8,"Paddington, now happily settled with the Brown family and a popular member of the local community, picks up a series of odd jobs to buy the perfect present for his Aunt Lucy's 100th birthday, only for the gift to be stolen.","I loved ""Paddington"" and - to my delight - I loved ""Paddington 2"" too.Of course, we start with the adorable character created by Michael Bond (who died between the release of the two films), the brilliant CGI representation of our furry friend, and the purr-fect voicing by Ben Wishaw. This is such a British franchise with so very many British character actors (OK, and one Irish) and so many London locations, although this is the kind of gentle London that we saw in ""Notting Hill"" (most notably in the prison scenes). Indeed the villain this time is less threatening than Nicole Kidman's character in the first film and played brilliantly by the ever-so- English star of ""Notting Hill"", Hugh Grant, who - following his success in ""Florence Foster Jenkins"" - shows that he is not just a pretty face.The film is endlessly inventive, not least in bringing to life a pop-up book of London landmarks which is at the heart of the plot, and it is stuffed full of visual gags as well as so many funny lines, a few aimed at adult viewers rather than little ones. My granddaughter (almost seven) found it delightful with one of her favourite scenes being Paddington's window-cleaning efforts. Be sure to stay for the credits - a final delight in 100 happy minutes."
Baywatch,2017,5.5,"Devoted lifeguard Mitch Buchannon butts heads with a brash new recruit, as they uncover a criminal plot that threatens the future of the bay.","It's not a James Bond movie, but the drama is real!Let's be totally honest - the movie is exactly as it's supposed to be. It's light, slightly offensive (to whoever it can) and sends this wink to the audience. Not like Deadpool completely breaking the 4th wall. In a way that keeps with the summer vibe.Definitely, a summer movie to watch with friends on a hot evening with a glass of Pimms!Lupierz"
The Shape of Water,2017,7.3,"At a top secret research facility in the 1960s, a lonely janitor forms a unique relationship with an amphibious creature that is being held in captivity.","A mute janitor falls in love with a fish man during the Cold War 1950's. That's about as simple as you can describe the plot of Guillermo Del Toro's new film The Shape of Water. Del Toro has always had in interest in monsters for his films. No matter how scary or deformed they look, they always have human traits that connect us with them. In this film, Del Toro has crafted his most likeable monster yet and tells a totally original story (trust me) that is part romance, part thriller.We follow the life of a janitor without a voice, Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins). She works in an underground facility alongside her co-worker, Zelda (Octavia Spencer), who talks enough to make up for Elisa's silence. One day a secret test subject is brought into the facility by the psychotic Strickland (Michael Shannon). The subject happens to be an amphibious-human hybrid creature that was found in the Amazon and has been brought back to America in order to be dissected and studied. After interacting together a few times, Elisa and the creature begin to form a special bond of love. Elisa recruits her neighbor (Richard Jenkins) and a sympathetic Russian spy (Michael Stuhlbarg) for a plan to break the creature from his chains and allow him to return home.The plot carries both a whimsical and serious tone to it. They mostly go together well as we get a fairytale that isn't afraid to embrace a childish feel with adult actions. However, GDT goes overboard once with a song and dance number that comes close to throwing the whole film off during its most poignant time.This is one of GDT's most mainstream films (apart from Pacific Rim) and is a great way for people unfamiliar with his work to be introduced. He expertly uses his monster experience to make a film that carries a realistic and fantasy tone.He also makes a very brave film that doesn't shy away from unconventional material. We get to see Michael Shannon having sex after his fingers get severed, political assassinations, and a self-pleasuring scene involving an egg timer. Oh, Elisa and the Amphibian Man also experience, let's just say, a special physical connection.The most impressive aspects of the film come from the behind the scenes work. The camera is brilliantly manned by Dan Lausten. It flows freely between the sets to give the film a romantic fantasy feel, but he also uses constant rain, dark colors, and confined spaces to make it feel like a cold war noir.The production design is also outstanding as each set piece is designed with care and precision. It's astonishing that this film was made for only $19.5 million because it looks like it cost more than triple that amount.The actors create one of the best ensembles of the year. They all carry their weight when matched together and make their characters interesting to watch. Hawkins is perfectly cast and leads the show with her signature shy look. She gives the most compelling and passionate performance of the year, all without saying a word.Richard Jenkins also gives an award-worthy supporting performance as Elisa's neighbor, Giles, who is going through a midlife crisis in terms of his career and sexuality. His scenes with Hawkins are astounding, but the ones with him alone aren't as great and take away from the important story.While not breaking any new ground, both Michael Shannon and Octavia Spencer do what they do best. Shannon gives his trademark evil, unhinged authority performance. Spencer does well in a performance very similar to her role in The Help.Michael Stuhlbarg also continues his amazing 2017 (also in Call Me by Your Name, The Post, and on TV with Fargo) by giving a great performance in the little time he has. Shoutout to Doug Jones as well for playing the Amphibian Man. He gives an endearing performance that brings warmth to his naturally cold-blooded character.The Shape of Water is easily one of 2017's best films and deserves all the Oscar nominations it will get. Every person in the cast and crew do their job exceptionally and create a breathtaking cinematic experience that makes you feel like a kid again while also giving you the stuff your adult mind wants to see."
On Body and Soul,2017,7.5,"When slaughterhouse workers Endre and M√°ria discover they share the same dreams, where they meet in a forest as deer and fall in love, they decide to make their dreams come true, but it's difficult in real life.","ON BODY AND SOUL is an invigorating comeback of Hungarian filmmaker Ildik√≥ Enyedi, her first feature film in 18 years which stimulatingly dances away with the Golden Bear in Berlin.The plot can be basically boiled down as follows: when a lonely man meets a lonely woman, how the pair fumbles to build an authentic connection without forfeiting their individuality, because both are crippled in very different terms, for a middle-aged Endre (Morcs√°nyi), it is his corporal handicap, a liability which might explain why he is a singleton, but for the young Maria (Borb√©ly), her condition is far more unusual and intriguing, she seems to be stuck in a limbo of emotionally arrested development, equipped with no social skills, and eschews human contact of any sort, but in accordance with the less unconventional ""idiot savant"" trope, she is also endowed with a preternatural power of memory, which might fairly explain her credentials as a quality inspector, newly appointed to work in Endre's abattoir, where he assumes the job as the chief financial officer.Despite of its well-trodden narrative arc, ON BODY AND SOUL refreshingly channels a mystical dream-reality correlation between the two protagonists, embodied in their shared dreamscape as a stag and a doe and through a subplot of psychological assessment, its earth-shattering revelation is comically underlined by Kl√°ra (a voluptuous R√©ka Tenki and an uncanny Jennifer Lawrence doppelg√§nger), the psychiatrist who is in a snit of believing that she has been taken for a ride (indeed, comical elements are friskily deployed throughout). It is this paranormal tie-in propels their bonding in motion, which reverberates as a sobering call, how could these two isolated souls even start a tentative gesture if there were no such beggar belief fabrication to break the humongous glacier between them, one must venerate Enyedi for her keen insight of the intrinsic difficulty apropos of human interactions, and her diligent craftsmanship of balancing the dream- reality dyad with an intimate but non-judgmental outlook amid the film's gorgeous imagery.It is still a bumpy road ahead after that, not least for the tabula-rosa Maria, who really steps out of her comfort zone and out on a limb to prepare herself for the ineluctable carnal ritual, but at the same time, her gawkiness sends many a wrong signal to an increasingly frustrated Endre, who is self-aware of their gaping age difference and dubious of his own potency. When the crunch comes Enyedi doesn't flinch from radically bringing a splurge of red into play, even if it offends the squeamish, which is not dissimilar with the slaughterhouse mise-en-sc√®ne, viewers are impelled to stare at pain and gore vis-√†-vis, because cruelty is the staple among human beings, whether we (sometimes even obliviously) cast it on our own kind or lesser beings.The two leading performances are of high caliber, dramaturgist G√©za Morcs√°nyi is well at ease with Endre's resigned, contemplative demeanor tinged with a smidgen of sophistication, whereas a doe-eyed (no puns intended!) Alexandra Borb√©ly is simply mesmerizing to hold our attention from stem to stern, often appears like an ethereal creature with her impassive lineaments, and registers her unaffected agenda at the same time in pinpoint economy.Mournfully honed in Laura Marling's WHAT HE WROTE, the thematic dirge bewitches Maria and audience alike, ON BODY AND SOUL reaches its crescendo with a hard-earned happy ending, when magic dissipates, a new lease on life is inaugurated, which could be also read as a herald of Enyedi's own future, career-wise. In fact, she is a few years younger than G√©za Morcs√°nyi in real life, so guaranteed by this fascinating love story, her next offering looks pretty buoyant, with only one proviso, the waiting time must be significantly pared down, an 18-year hiatus is an egregious waste of her talent."
Wonder Woman,2017,7.3,"When a pilot crashes and tells of conflict in the outside world, Diana, an Amazonian warrior in training, leaves home to fight a war, discovering her full powers and true destiny.","Reviewers say 'Wonder Woman' is celebrated for its strong female lead, Gal Gadot's compelling performance, and the character's empowering journey. The film is lauded for its engaging action scenes, vibrant visuals, and the chemistry between Gadot and Chris Pine. However, some critics note pacing issues, underdeveloped side characters, and overuse of CGI. The story, though enjoyable, is criticized for its familiarity and plot inconsistencies. Despite these flaws, 'Wonder Woman' is generally viewed as a positive addition to the DC Extended Universe."
Thor: Ragnarok,2017,7.9,"Imprisoned on the planet Sakaar, Thor must race against time to return to Asgard and stop Ragnar√∂k, the destruction of his world, at the hands of the powerful and ruthless villain Hela.","Reviewers say 'Thor: Ragnarok' is lauded for its humor, action, and visuals, marking a significant improvement. Taika Waititi's direction brings a refreshing comedic tone, making it one of Marvel's funniest films. Hemsworth, Blanchett, and Goldblum deliver standout performances. However, some criticize the pacing, emotional depth, and humor over serious storytelling. Continuity issues and its place in the MCU are also noted. Overall, it's a fun, entertaining, and visually stunning film."
Spider-Man: Homecoming,2017,7.4,Peter Parker tries to stop Adrian 'The Vulture' Toomes from selling weapons made with advanced Chitauri technology while trying to balance his life as an ordinary high school student.,"Reviewers say 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is lauded for Tom Holland's engaging portrayal of Peter Parker, Michael Keaton's Vulture, and its blend of humor and drama. The film's unique approach to Spider-Man's story, focusing on high school life, is appreciated. However, criticisms include reliance on the MCU framework, inconsistent abilities, and less impactful humor and action. Pacing, product placement, and female character handling also draw complaints."
The Bachelors,2017,6.8,"After his wife's early death, a mourning father moves with his teenage son across the country for a private-school teaching job. Their lives begin to transform thanks to two unique women who help them embrace life and love again.","This film tells the story of a man and his teenage son, who struggles to cope with the death of their wife and mother.It is unusual to have a romantic comedy set in such dire backdrop, but in here it works. The two budding romances are convincing and engaging. I enjoyed watching it."
Gifted,2017,7.6,"Frank, a single man raising his child prodigy niece Mary, is drawn into a custody battle with his mother.","Gifted is a movie about relationships, family, and doing what's right for children. The film centers around Mary (McKenna Grace), a 7 year old who is academically gifted, she can do mathematics at a college/adult level. She lives with her uncle (Chris Evans), because her mother died and her father has never been in the picture. She starts the first grade and of course finds it tedious because she's far beyond that level. Her grandmother comes to take her to live with her in Boston where she can be put in a prestigious school and be surrounded by tutors. Mary's uncle doesn't want that because her mother said she wanted Mary to be a normal kid and enjoy life and not be constantly taught at all her life. But Mary's grandmother isn't about to give up.... they end up going to court over the matter and fighting for custody. The film features excellent performances by every member of the cast. It also has great writing. The writing brings out the films heart, it shows the love and sense of family that Mary and her uncle have. I 100% suggest Gifted! 8/10."
Justice League,2017,6.0,"Steppenwolf and his Parademons return after eons to capture Earth. However, Batman seeks the help of Wonder Woman to recruit and assemble Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman to fight the powerful new enemy.","Reviewers say 'Justice League' garnered mixed reactions, praising its action sequences, strong performances by Gal Gadot and Ezra Miller, and enjoyable cast chemistry. Criticisms included a generic villain, lack of character development, overuse of CGI, and a rushed storyline. Many felt it lacked Marvel's depth and cohesion but appreciated its tonal blend. Disappointment arose over Superman's role and runtime constraints. Despite flaws, it was seen as an improvement over prior DC films, offering hope for the future."
Rough Night,2017,5.2,Things go terribly wrong for a group of girlfriends who hire a male stripper for a bachelorette party in Miami.,"I love TV show Broad City and was looking forward to this because two of the creatives behind that show paired up to give us Rough Night. The generic title (a switch from Move that Body which was much more suitable) should have warned me. Rough Night is forgettable and not really that funny.The movie starts out in 2006 where a group of 4 friends get drunk at Halloween, win a beer pong competition and vow to stay friends forever. Fast forward 10 years and the group is reuniting for Jess's (Scarlett Johansson, bland, bland, bland, comedy is NOT her forte) bachelorette weekend at a fancy house in Miami. They party, snort coke, are joined with Jess's Australian friend Pippa (Kate McKinnon in a role that MUST have been written for Rebel Wilson. Surely?). Her friends decide to get Jess a stripper and here is when things go wrong: high on coke they accidentally end up killing the stripper and things quickly spiral out of control as they first try to do the responsible thing of calling the police and then move on to hiding the body.There was minor protests before the film being released about the movie making a punchline of killing sex workers but the film could have overcome this and he gruesome premise if not for a few things. First of all the women lack friendship chemistry. I don't believe any of these women were ever friends even if a big part of it is that they are supposed to have drifted apart. Second the casting is all awful. Scarlett is not a comedy actress and neither is Zoe Kravitz and it shows. Without being backed up by her hilariously crafted Broad City alter ego Ilana Glazer comes across as simply annoying. Kate McKinnon and Jillian Bell are probably the best with their characters but neither one is given much to do. McKinnon just leans hard into her accent and Bell is saddled with a ""loser desperate friend who can't take a hint"". The third thing is that the movie never quite finds it's tone. It struggles between ""woke"" dialogue for characters who are actually just mean and instead of simply leaning into the fact that these women are awful and allowing them to get even more absurdly awful it's way too protective of the characters and keeps trying to redeem them by making them ""nice"" people. It's both incredibly boring and keeps the movie from really flying.Still, Rough Night isn't a total write off. There are enough funny lines and a subplot (involving Jess's fianc√© who the movie allows to get into REALLY ridiculous shenanigans) to be watchable. Just wish that the script would have let the ladies turn loose too."
Fast & Furious 8,2017,6.6,"When a mysterious woman seduces Dominic Toretto into the world of terrorism and a betrayal of those closest to him, the crew face trials that will test them as never before.","Furious 7 had one the best conclusions for a film series ever. I and was perfectly happy if the series ended there and continued with spin-offs or hell even a Netflix TV show. But the almighty dollar wants these films to continue. I really had my doubts going into this film. I didn't think the series had any fuel left. The story arch in the last 3 films was complete. What else can we tell now that the main antagonist was no longer in the series? Well, I was wrong, really wrong, I was very surprised by this movie, surprised to the fact that I was very entertained and had as much fun as I had with this series since Tokyo Drift (yes I liked Tokyo Drift). The main driving point of the story (which the trailers express) of Dom going rouge was a valid plot point and with a twist to the series that worked.What I liked about the film was the main plot device and of course the action. All the action scenes were all fun to watch (personally, I like the opening sequence best) But this movie delivered on what it promises and that's over the top action. At one point our anti- heroes seemed like superheroes who drive in their own ""Batmobiles"" and ride to the rescue.What I didn't like was fact that a couple of action scenes were fun but very ridiculous and somewhat didn't work for me. And one of the characters in the film has an arch that just betrays the last two films and makes you question the motive of others. But on the downside, the franchise will run out of fuel soon and start to get that ""been there, done that"" feel to it that will make the next films seem boring. You somewhat feel that in the climax of this film but it's the main plot point that keeps the action scene lifted because you know it's coming just when and how keeps you invested.All in all the movie was really good and you will be entertained and I would rank it as well as parts 5, 6 and 7 but the finish line is near and I feel the next films (I read 2 more are coming) will not have enough fuel to make to the finish line. Will the next films kick in the NOS and project us to the finish line...I really do hope so."
Breaking Bad,,9.5,A chemistry teacher diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer turns to manufacturing and selling methamphetamine with a former student to secure his family's future.,"Reviewers say 'Breaking Bad' is celebrated for its intricate storytelling, complex characters, and moral ambiguity. Walter White's transformation captivates audiences, praised for meticulous writing and compelling arcs. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul deliver standout performances. Cinematography, dark humor, and exploration of human nature are frequently highlighted. Often compared to 'The Sopranos' and 'The Wire', it is considered a modern TV masterpiece. Minor flaws are noted, but overall quality is exceptional."
Four Rooms,1995,6.7,Four interlocking tales that take place in a fading hotel on New Year's Eve.,"Four Rooms, the 4 part directed, 4 part written mix-matched movie turns out to be an awesome combination. With Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino working on this film, you seem to expect a trigger-happy film festival with plenty of bombs and explosives to spare. But what the final product turns out to be is a laugh-out-loud comedy which follows a bellhop's mishaps one night as he scrambles to keep his hotel in order. Tim Roth is always a great performer and in this movie there is no difference. Kudos indeed."
Keeping Up with the Joneses,2016,5.9,A suburban couple becomes embroiled in an international espionage plot when they discover that their seemingly perfect new neighbors are government spies.,"'KEEPING UP WITH THE JONESES': Three Stars (Out of Five)The new action-comedy from director Greg Mottola; the man who brought us 'SUPERBAD', 'ADVENTURELAND' and 'PAUL' (all great films in my opinion). This movie is sadly not so great. It tells the story of a suburban couple, that suspects their picture-perfect new neighbors might be government spies. The movie was written by Michael LeSieur (who also wrote 'YOU, ME AND DUPREE'); and it stars Zach Galifianakis, Isla Fisher, Jon Hamm and Gal Gadot. It's received mostly poor reviews from critics, and it also bombed at the Box Office. I found it to be mildly amusing, but mostly disappointing.Jeff Gafney (Galifianakis), and his wife Karen (Fisher), both live a pretty boring and average suburban life. That all changes though, when their new neighbors move in. Tim (Hamm) and Natalie Jones (Gadot) seem too perfect to be true; their both extremely good looking, successful and talented. Karen right away suspects something is off about the two; and when her suspicions turn out to be true, Jeff and Karen both find themselves involved in life threatening international espionage.The film has a great setup; I really like the characters and the story, it just doesn't follow through that well. Mottola's direction is adequate, and the performances are all good (I'm becoming a huge Gal Gadot fan), it's just not that funny. The action scenes are decent though, for a slapstick comedy like this. I just wish the movie could have been a little funnier. Like I said, it's mildly amusing though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/192396224"
Alien: Covenant,2017,6.4,"The crew of a colony ship, bound for a remote planet, discover an uncharted paradise with a threat beyond their imagination, and must attempt a harrowing escape.","Alien: Covenant (2017)** (out of 4)Sequel to PROMETHEUS and a connection to the ALIEN series, this sci-fi film has a spaceship trying to locate a planet so that the human race can continue. The crew are planning on building a colony but they notice a much closer planet that can hold life. They decide to head there to see what's on it and soon the horror starts.To put it mildly, ALIEN: COVENANT is a major disappointment. It seems a lot of fans were unhappy with PROMETHEUS because it was more of a thinking man's movie and less of a action/horror/sci-fi film. It seems that this film was in trouble from the start because you have to wonder if there was some sort of debate before hand on what should be done with it. PROMETHEUS was a terrific movie that made you think about a lot of things but sadly this sequel doesn't do that. Instead, it almost seems as the filmmakers were forced to answer a few questions about PROMETHEUS and then they wanted to throw in the action of an ALIEN sequel.What really shocked me about this movie is the fact that it almost put me to sleep several times. I'm not going to say that the film is a cure for insomnia but at the same time it's deadly slow at times even though there's usually something always going on. As I said, the screenplay doesn't seem to know what the film should do and the majority of the running time is just downright boring. The film starts off with a tragedy yet it's hard to have any emotions for the characters because we're just getting to know them. Another problem is the fact that the characters are all rather bland with the exception of Michael Fassbender's two-part role.As I said, I thought the characters were rather boring and I'd argue that not many of the performances are all that memorable. Perhaps a longer director's cut will eventually show up but there's really not too much here. Fassbender delivers a fine performance but I can't say I was impressed with the rest of the cast. On a technical level Ridley Scott is a visual genius so all of that stuff looks great. There's some extremely gory scenes of violence, which are very good but the film is just way too uneven to work.It's like part of the movie wanted to be another thinking man's movie but there's another part that wanted to be a bloody action film. It just doesn't work in the end."
Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk,2016,6.2,"19-year-old Billy Lynn is brought home for a victory tour after a harrowing Iraq battle. Through flashbacks, the film shows what really happened to his squad - contrasting the realities of war with America's perceptions.","The politics of war are incredibly complex, and the human cost is disturbingly high. There are no wonder why those who give up their lives to fight oversea are honored with great dignity. But the big question in this war drama directed by Oscar Winner Ang Lee is: Are we honoring these soldiers the right way? That is an idea that this film takes a dive in, but not with enough impact. Lee's approach to the absorbing topic is too shallow of emotional touch. The greatest accolade Lee acquires in this picture is allowing it to shine with a unique visual innovation, and that is shooting the film with an unheard-of frame rate of 120 FPS to capture the immense atmosphere of the war sequences. It is a technological achievement that powerfully shows how far Hollywood has advanced in technological. Seeing this movie at a theater with an unusual frame rate that high is an alarmingly tough get as there are only six theaters around the globe that include this, with only two of these theaters planted in the United States. Set in 2004, this follows 19-year old Billy Lynn (played by Joe Alwyn), an Army specialist returning home from active duty in Iraq with his fellow squad members. On the day of a Thanksgiving home game at the Dallas Cowboys stadium, Billy, honored as a hero for his duty, and his squad members are brought together on a victory tour during the halftime show. During the tour, Billy is hit with flashbacks of the tragedies that occurred during the battle in Iraq including the death of his friend Staff Sergeant Shroom (played by Vin Diesel) as opposed to the American citizens fantasized perceptions of what they think happened over there. Along the way, he finds his heroism manipulated by film producers Norm (played by Steve Martin) and Albert (played by Chris Tucker) who are trying to land a movie deal out of the events that squadron's faced.Based on the novel by Ben Fountain, this drama capitalizes on themes of patriotism and honor, and opens light on social issues that run between the grim realities of war and the distorted views of active combat by citizens back at home. The primary concern here deals with home civilians including the media exploiting the heroism soldiers acquire during active duty overseas, simply for our own personal gain. As disconcerting as it is, one thing this film proves is that unless you have been in active combat, you have little or no idea of what it is realistically feels like being in active combat overseas. Director Ang Lee makes an engaging point out of this concept. But alongside, the film also introduces these contradictions on how soldiers are celebrated by citizens for their active duty, yet people all over America continue to disdain war as an unnecessary bargain; an idea that the story never fully explores. From there on, the story slips into a jumbled mess and offers little emotional touch to the point where viewers are left with no impact. The film's emotional highpoints stand during the flashbacks of the title character and his squad fighting in Iraq which are powerfully shot and executed in authenticity. It's too bad that these scenes only make up a small portion of the near-two- hour runtime, while the majority the picture follows Billy and his squadron walking through the stadium during the halftime show with Destiny's Child performing and fireworks going off. If this manages to wring anything out of the story's framework other than its absorbing ideas, it is the performances, particularly Joe Alwyn as Billy and Kristen Stewart as his older sister, given the opportunity to flex her acting muscles. The rest of the cast offer some good on screen presences, operating with a sense of cynicism and humility. Looking for something Oscar- worthy though, you are probably better off looking elsewhere.Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is a shallow war drama that fails to arrest viewers with its timely themes and Ang Lee's scattershot approach to an otherwise thoughtful examination of its eponymous character versus America's fantasized perceptions of war. Although the final product is disappointingly forgettable, some may admire Ang Lee's effort on embracing the film with his visual innovation. However, its a technological effort that is too early to introduce in major theaters at this point."
Maudie,2016,7.6,An arthritic Nova Scotia woman works as a housekeeper while she hones her skills as an artist and eventually becomes a beloved figure in the community.,"I think Sally Hawkins was great in this year's The Shape of Water. I understand why she's getting attention for it and I think she would be a fine nominee. But really, there's no question in my mind that it's her performance in Maudie that is the much more impressive overall. She gives a career-best turn here, a completely internal performance that could have been all showy, broad theatrics had a lesser actress gotten the part. She's absolutely amazing and in a fair world would be getting nominated (if not winning) for this work. Ethan Hawke is also fantastic, showing that he can really shine in character parts like this."
Isle of Dogs,2018,7.8,"Set in Japan, Isle of Dogs follows a boy's odyssey in search of his lost dog.","Super cute Japenese culture film of precious dogs and rescuing friends. Wes Anderson's masterpieces of ensemble cast deserves better; all his films are unique and lovable! This one especially is full of great vibes, incredible music, and a very heartwarming story! I originally saw Isle of Dogs in the theater with my mom cause she's a huge Wes Anderson fan so that was a blast, today watched with my sister in the living room that was cute."
You Were Never Really Here,2017,6.7,"A traumatized veteran unafraid of violence tracks down missing girls for a living. When a job spins out of control, Joe's nightmares overtake him as a conspiracy is uncovered leading to what could be his death trip or his awakening.","In the realm of cinematic artistry, Lynne Ramsay's ""You Were Never Really Here"" emerges as a film that defies the conventional boundaries of its genre. It is a film that, with its dreamlike cadence and haunting visual poetry, captures the viewer in a grip as tight and compelling as the narrative it unfolds.Joaquin Phoenix delivers a performance of such raw intensity that it becomes the beating heart of the film. His portrayal of Joe, a man whose life is a mosaic of trauma and violence, is both a towering achievement and a deeply human one. Phoenix's Joe is a man of few words, but each silence speaks volumes, each glance carries the weight of a thousand emotions. He is the weary titan of this story, carrying the burdens of his past with a stoicism that is as heartbreaking as it is admirable.Ramsay's direction is nothing short of masterful. She weaves a tapestry of images and sounds that are as beautiful as they are disturbing. The film's score, a dissonant symphony by Jonny Greenwood, is accentuating the film's atmosphere of disquiet. The cinematography is a chiaroscuro of the soul, painting each scene with the shades of Joe's turbulent inner world.The narrative structure of ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a bold choice. Ramsay opts for an elliptical storytelling style that mirrors the fragmented psyche of its protagonist. This choice is both the film's greatest strength and its most significant challenge to the viewer. The plot does not unfold; it reveals itself in shards, each piece a glimpse into the abyss that Joe stares into every day.However, this very narrative choice may also be where the film falters for some. The disjointed nature of the storytelling, while thematically resonant, can at times leave the audience grasping for a thread to hold onto. The film demands attention and patience, and not all viewers are willing to give it the concentration it requires.The violence, while never gratuitous, is visceral and unflinching. It serves the story, but it also runs the risk of alienating those with a more sensitive disposition. The film's resolution, too, may strike some as abrupt, leaving a lingering question as to the ultimate fate of its characters.""You Were Never Really Here"" is a film that, like its protagonist, is not easily forgotten. It is a challenging, evocative piece of cinema that dares to delve into the darkness of the human condition. While it may not find universal acclaim due to its unconventional approach and somber themes, it stands as a testament to the power of visual storytelling and the enduring strength of a well-crafted character study."
The Place,2017,7.0,"The fates of an apparently random group of strangers who each come into contact with a mysterious figure who they believe possesses the power to grant any wish, in return for which they must carry out a task he assigns them.","The Place is a vivid example of why European cinema will always be relevant. A simple tie is maximum, all the actions of the film take place in one place. Ordinary actors (perhaps in Italy they are known, but I only know Marco Giallini). And dialogues. The whole film rests on them. They are as simple as possible - everything is shot in a regular eight. Nice simple chamber story."
Jacob's Ladder,1990,7.4,"Mourning his dead son, a haunted Vietnam War veteran attempts to uncover his past while suffering from a severe case of dissociation. To do so, he must decipher reality and life from his own dreams, delusions, and perceptions of death.","Jacobs Ladder is one of those rare films that throws you and your mind about like a ragdoll before giving you a bitter conclusion that turns everything upside down again. Forget Donnie Darko, that was mere childs play, this film is something else. Jacobs Ladder provides an experience so intimidating, brutal, wonderful and beautiful unparalleled to this day. This is something you have never seen or experienced before in film, and will probably never experience again.Jacob Singer is a postal worker, who, through the brutal effects of Vietnam, mentally breaks down, and starts seeing demons following him, killing his friends, raping his wife...... Make no mistake, Jacobs Ladder is a grim film but behind its dark mask lies an uplifting message of hope, freedom and mental release. I wont say anymore, because spoiling the plot for you would be extremely horrible of me, who am i to take away the magic of seeing the film from you.I'm not going to say that this is accessible to everyone, its not in the least. If your favourite film is American Pie than turn away, this is REAL film making. A lot of people will not like this, because they will expect, like with most films, to have all the answers served to them on a plate. Jacobs Ladder requires the viewer to do the thinking, letting them have their own perceptions of the film rather then being fed that of the directors. If you do choose to go on Jacobs journey with him be warned, it wont always be pretty, but you will come out of it gratified that for once in film you have the freedom to think for yourself."
Darkest Hour,2017,7.4,"In May 1940, the fate of World War II hangs on Winston Churchill, who must decide whether to negotiate with Adolf Hitler, or fight on knowing that it could mean the end of the British Empire.","At this point, ""Darkest Hour"" has an overall rating of 5.3. I do not understand this at all, but the film has not actually been released yet and has only been seen in film festivals. I assume the overall score will increase considerably--especially since the two reviews for it were quite positive.Now I must point out that I am a retired history teacher and I consider Winston Churchill to be perhaps the greatest politician of the century. So, I clearly have a bias and predisposition towards liking the movie...especially if it's done well. Is it a crowd pleaser? Maybe not, as the average movie-goer (especially teens) might not enjoy this or care a lick about the film.The story covers only a portion of the month of May, 1940...just before the fall of France during WWII. Prime Minster Chamberlain is about to be tossed out of office, as his appeasement strategy with Hitler has turned out to be completely stupid. In his place, some hope for Churchill to be the next Prime Minister...though some forces are working to depose him as soon as he comes to power. At the same time, the war is going as badly as it possibly can. Can Churchill survive this? Well, of course...duh, it's HISTORY!The reasons to see this are two big ones....the film has achieved the look of 1940 beautifully and Gary Oldman provides an Oscar- winning performance in the lead. If he is not at least nominated for this top award, I will be completely shocked...and he really managed (along with ample prosthetics) to LOOK and SOUND like the great man. Great job all around...and a perfect film."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",2017,8.1,A mother personally challenges the local authorities to solve her daughter's murder when they fail to catch the culprit.,"Reviewers say 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is acclaimed for its dark humor, complex characters, and standout performances by Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell. The film explores themes of grief, anger, and justice, with a nuanced look at small-town dynamics and moral ambiguity. Critics praise its writing, direction, and ensemble cast. However, some find the ending abrupt and the plot implausible, with over-the-top actions. Despite these criticisms, many consider it a significant work in modern cinema."
War for the Planet of the Apes,2017,7.4,"After the apes suffer unimaginable losses, Caesar wrestles with his darker instincts and begins his own mythic quest to avenge his kind.","A quick look at the bad reviews shows that most of them were written around the same time, mid July 2017 and most all of them are 1 star ratings, an obvious attack on the movie makers and nothing to do with the quality of the film. I urge you to ignore these fake reviews and read instead those written after the summer of 2017!"
Apenplaneet,1968,8.0,"After being kept in hypersleep during a long expedition into deep space, an astronaut crew crash-lands in the 40th century on a planet where highly intelligent non-human ape species are dominant and humans are enslaved.","Absolutely incredible. Easily in my top 10 all time, and that's saying something. This movie kept me captivated from the beginning all the way to the end. It combined a super setting and effects (at least for '68) and the casting was perfect. This movie included, in my opinion, one of the most memorable line in film history, ""get your damn paws of me, you stinkin' apes!"". Not to ruin it for anyone, the ending is also one of the best in film history. This easily won my award for most entertaining and original story ever, because it captivated the imagination, especially considering the fact that it could actually happen (it's a stretch, but...) This is a rather short response, but I could just go on and on saying how great it was, but it would only be redundant. Overall, this movie was absolutely incredible9.5\10 stars (I'm a tough reviewer)"
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,2011,7.0,"In the bleak days of the Cold War, espionage veteran George Smiley is forced from semi-retirement to uncover a Soviet Agent within MI6.","I have not read the book nor seen the 1979 landmark series that garnered so much acclaim for the BBC and Sir Alec Guinness, but such contextualisation is not needed to recognise that this version of 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' is a masterful re-telling of John le Carr√©'s seminal work about British espionage during the Cold War. An early scene really encapsulates the whole tone and mood of the film. A retired George Smiley (played majestically by Gary Oldman) is sitting at home and enjoying a documentary about Winston Churchill (which seems suitably apt for a man of his former position) when his doorbell suddenly and unexpectedly rings. His head turns slowly to the left in the direction of the impudent sound and the instantaneous look of sheer effrontery and disdain on Oldman's face will leave you chuckling as his peaceful reverie is rudely disturbed. Such scenes like this leaven the film with humour but ultimately this is a chamber piece; expertly played by the cream of British acting talent headed by Goldman and Hurt (who incidentally could also have been a great George Smiley) and told with a languid verve that unravels the complex plotting in a series of tableaux vivants laden with mystery and suspense, but which also acts as important plot points and clues.The film is about the hunt for a Soviet 'mole' in the highest echelons of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6 but fictitiously known as 'The Circus') by George Smiley, an intelligence officer who has been brought out of forced retirement by Oliver Lacon, the Civil Service overseer of the Circus. Through a love affair with the wife of a Russian intelligence officer, a British agent, Ricki Tarr (Tom Hardy) discovers that there may be a high ranking Soviet mole within the Circus. Aided by Peter Guillam (Bendedict Cumberbatch) who is Tarr's handler, Smiley sets about uncovering the mole without the knowledge of Circus leadership, anyone of whom might be the mole, headed by Percy Alleline (Toby Jones) and his deputies Bill Haydon (Colin Firth), Roy Bland (Ciar√°n Hinds) and Toby Esterhase (David Dencik) ‚Äì the 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' of the book (codenames assigned by Control, Head of British Secret Service).The director, Tomas Alfredson, established his reputation with 'Let the Right One In', an icy Swedish romantic horror that dealt with relationships and this too, is a film about human nature, moral dilemmas and relationships ‚Äì friendship, loyalty and betrayal on intimate and grand scales with personal and national implications. Like 'Let the Right One In' Alfredson imbues 'Tinker, Tailor', Soldier, Spy' (his first English language feature) with somnambulistic pacing and mood that requires the audience to be patient, but this is richly rewarded with scenes, shot after shot, that ravish the eye and heavy with period atmosphere and drama. James Bond this is not and George Smiley has more in common with Harry Palmer than Ian Fleming's vigorous secret agent. Indeed, Robert De Niro's admirable treatment of the early history of the Criminal Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 'The Good Shepherd' (2006) has a similar cipher in Edward Wilson ‚Äì a 'grey man' whose very ordinariness renders him invisible to counter espionage and thus makes him the perfect intelligence operative. A raised voice towards the end of 'Tinker, Tailor' is as excited as Smiley gets but for those not familiar with the story the ending will leave you with a broad smile of satisfaction as the 'grey man' (note Smiley's grey hair, grey countenance and grey suit replete with over-sized glasses and shambling gait) of the secret intelligence service wins the day.The screenwriters, Peter Straughan and the late Bridget O'Connor, have done an exceptional job in condensing down what is clearly a labyrinthine Cold War thriller into a classic two hour potboiler without losing any of its exposition, characters, and plotting. John le Carr√© and his fans will be proud. This is a thinking man's film about a period of recent history that is as murky as it is exciting and relevant today with its eternal themes of friendship, loyalty and national security. There must be many more stories of espionage to mine from both sides of the Iron Curtain and I do hope this film kick starts a renewed interest in telling the stories of the Cold War warriors who shaped the modern world. If the film does 'King's Speech' levels of business I think it just might and Hollywood would be the richer for it."
Wilson,2017,5.8,"A lonely, neurotic, and hilariously honest middle-aged man reunites with his estranged wife, and meets his teenage daughter for the first time.",Miscast or something. I felt awkward watching it. Neither of the leads seemed even vaguely realistic nor did the plot. It was all trying too hard. I hated everything about it right down to Harrelson saying the name Pippi.
Baby Driver,2017,7.5,"Coerced into working for a crime boss, a young getaway driver must face the music when a doomed heist threatens his life, love, and freedom.","I somehow felt love and hate sort of feeling for Baby Driver. The movie started off on nice note but then somehow slows down and eventually picks up too much pace in second half. It's pretty hard to keep the interest alive all the time. I really loved the song selection and even noticed me nodding to few beats as well. The car action sequence were well shot too. But then the second half of the movie was so fast that it feels like they just wanted to end this but still wanted to keep it alive. Don't think if there was any need of few gruesome sequences.The story had so much potential and having some good cast along, it could have gone to great heights. But it disappoints in this area and turns out to be just another mindless action drama for light viewing."
The Dark Tower,2017,5.6,A boy haunted by visions of a dark tower from a parallel reality teams up with the tower's disillusioned guardian to stop an evil warlock known as the Man in Black who plans to use the boy to destroy the tower and open the gates of Hell.,"Reviewers say 'The Dark Tower' garners mixed reactions for its ambitious yet flawed adaptation of Stephen King's series. While Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey's performances are lauded, the film is criticized for its rushed narrative and lack of character depth. Visual effects and action scenes receive praise, but the plot is often deemed simplistic and disconnected from the books' rich lore. Some enjoy it as a standalone fantasy, while devoted fans express disappointment with its deviations from the original story."
Mortal Kombat: Conquest,,6.2,"Kung Lao has triumphed in the Mortal Kombat tournament, defeating Shang Tsung and saving Earth Realm. Now, he must train a new generation of warriors for the next tournament.","I am a very big Mortal Kombat fan. I love both movies and I thought this series was a good one. Back when this on TV I was a huge wrestling fan (I am not happy with today's wrestling but I still love the classic WWF & WCW days back in the 80s & early 90s) and I'd watch this right after WCW's Monday Nitro show. Mortal Kombat: Conquest had good actors and actresses which included the beautiful Kristanna Loken which her character looked so good looking and neat in this series. Fans of Terminator 3 should check her out because she is very good in this. There was notable good acting by the other cast members Bruce Locke, Daniel Bernhardt, Jeffrey Meek, Tracy Douglas, Paolo Montalban, and others. There was even guest stars in some good roles such as Eva Mendes and WCW's Bryan Clarke of Kronic (WWF's Adam Bomb) in some episodes. The series had some big time potential but it didn't air long on television. If you are able to watch this series and if you love Mortal Kombat then watch it!"
Mortal Kombat II,1997,3.6,A group of martial-arts warriors has only six days to save the Earth from an extra-dimensional invasion.,"I had seen bits n pieces of it in the early 2k on a cable tv channel.Saw the entire movie recently on a fast forward mode.This is the second installment in the Mortal Kombat film series based on the video game and the story picks up immediately after the last film ended.While the first part was at least entertaining, this one is sheer lousy.We have James Remar's body double doing all the wire fu stunts and unlike Christopher Lambert, James Remar got bored with his long hair n white monk gown. He does a crop cut n wears a designer waist coat n military boots.I found Sandra Hess as Sonya Blade more attractive than the previous part's gal.Talisa Soto who played Kitana is only 4 years younger to Musetta Vander who played Kitana's mother. I found Musetta more attractive than Talisa.Brian Thompson as the main villain is no match to Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa."
Ter√°pia,,8.7,A successful psychologist battles with problems in his personal life.,"This show should get more stars and lights in the media because finally it's an awesome story with great actors! You just can't stop watching it. It really charms you in a good way. The story is about a psychologist and his patients, set in the same room. Editing and shooting is awesome, sound is great as well. You don't feel the ""hungarian style"" its a very modern and great tv show. I highly recommend everyone!"
American Assassin,2017,6.2,"After the death of his girlfriend at the hands of terrorists, Mitch Rapp is drawn into the world of counterterrorism, mentored by tough-as-nails former U.S. Navy S.E.A.L. Stan Hurley.","Better than many reviewers indicate.American Assassin follows Author Vince Flynn's character Mitch Rapp (Dylan O'Brien) and his mentor Stan Hurley (Michael Keaton) who leads a super secret CIA operative group tasked to take out the world's most threatening bad guys - A secret camp in the wooded hills near Roanoke, Virginia provides a select group of hand-picked field operatives (assassins) with elite specialized training (for assassins) that supposedly exceeds Navy Seals training in sophistication of infiltrating and blending into targeted zones, with a killing effectiveness that surpasses Bourne and Bond.One problem here - when you take on two of the most successful action franchises in movie history (Bourne and Bond), you better have your ducks in a row (including most importantly the script), and that is where this film fails.The screenwriter needed to produce a more cohesive script in adapting Flynn's prequel book. The film looks and sounds like it was rushed to production before the script and story boards were thought through and revised.Time is money, but not investing enough time sometimes leads to losing your entire investment, and if the desired outcome was a green light for a franchise, the ""fail"" here was in the script.Michael Keaton holds this film up, and although I have a hard time seeing him in the role, he pulled it off with his trade-mark push-the-envelope edginess.O'Brien was at first, hard to swallow in the role with his quiet vulnerable demeanor and school age heartthrob looks (with some edgy outlier undertones) that have made him so popular with millennials. But he frankly did an admirable job, and is the most promising element of the film in terms of franchising this into sequels. Not many lines of dialogue, but like Bourne, Rapp speaks loudly with his fists, feet, intelligence, wiliness, and willingness.The make-up was amazing in portraying an ever growing number of cuts, bruises, gashes, and other assorted traumas accrued by the cast - realistic, accurate and impressive - among the best ever in film.Action/fight/vehicle chase scenes were well above par as were the special effects and CGI (only one scene leans fully on CGI and was well done).Cinematography and editing are very good, and the pacing of the film is excellent for the most part.My guess is this is a one and done film, but what a shame, as there is great potential for an American Assassin franchise, and this is one if the best recent additions to the action genre, especially given more time to complete the film at a 007 level.The director and screenwriter(s) need to get it together though, IF there is a sequel - the script is the weakest point, usually a death nail for my reviews, but the director, cinematographer, make-up, and fx make up a lot of ground in that regard.For the hope of more (and better), I'm giving one additional Star bringing this 7-Star film up to 8/10."
Fahrenheit 451,2018,5.0,"In a terrifying care-free future, a young man, Guy Montag, whose job as a fireman is to burn all books, questions his actions after meeting a young woman - and begins to rebel against society.","I found Francois Truffaut's film version of Fahrenheit 451 hard going, not helped by a distant performance from star Oskar Werner.Ramin Bahrani reimagines the Ray Bradbury novel. He sets it in an era of fake news, fake history, disinformation. Propaganda at its best. Burn books and you can reinvent an alternative timeline.Set in a future Dystopia, Guy Montag (Michael P Jordan) and his mentor Captain Beatty (Michael Shannon) are firemen after a second civil war America who burn books, a tradition that goes far back as Benjamin Franklin! It is easier to control people if they could not find information and think for themselves. It was easy to keep people happy if they do not get offended from what they read.Montag carries out his work diligently and is in line for promotion but gets taken in by the Eels, a counter group who preserve the information contained in books. They learn books by heart, the upload it on the net, they rebel against the government.Shannon can play the villain in his sleep. Jordan has the harder part but he is rather vacuous, maybe he is meant to be that way, a person who has never learned to think or question for himself.There are some good ideas in this film but they never hang together or are fully realised. With two failed adaptations, I think Bradbury's novel might come across better on the page than on the screen."
Brazilok,2017,6.1,Chaos bursts out among the gypsy minority of the town of Acsa when the mayor announces that this year the gypsy football team called Brazilians can also take part in the football championship of the village.,"Hey Everyone!I can't say more, than after Sunshine and Moszkva T√©r, this is the 3rd strongest movie title from Hungary.

The Pixar Story,2007,7.7,The Pixar Story takes audiences behind the scenes of the groundbreaking company that pioneered a new generation of animation and forever changed the face of filmmaking.,"Wow...what a great and thorough film. This is the story of Pixar Studio--from its earliest days to the present (which was 2007 at the time). It offers so much more than you might expect from such a film--wonderful access to the folks who built the studio who you might think were too busy or too important to participate--but they did. So, in addition to seeing lots of great films being made, you get to meet folks like John Lasseter and Steve Jobs and see them as people--very excited and creative people, but still people. Amazing access, however, isn't all. You also get a great sense of excitement and fun--and it's practically impossible to watch this film without feeling this and feeling inspired--and the music sure helps with this as well. For fans of CGI...heck, for ANYONE, this is a must-see film and you learn a lot and have a great time learning. See this film."
Volver,2006,7.6,"After her death, a mother returns to her home town in order to fix the situations she couldn't resolve during her life.","Volver is a movie centering on women, for the woman.Volver (pronounced Bol-ber in Spanish) means ""Return"". The theme ""return"" revolves around the film. Three generations of women: The granny (Carmen Maura) returning from the dead, the mother Raimunda (Penelope Cruz) returning from her discordant life, and daughter (Yohana Cobo) recovering from abuse from her step father.Penelope Cruz is colorful and affecting playing Raimunda, probably her best role to date. This role will assure others of her capability to act, napping several Best Actresses nominations to date. She may have lost the Oscars to the Queen, but she won't be just known as the ex-girlfriend of Tom Cruise.This is a culturally rich movie which brings us to the back alleys of Spain, looking at lives from the rich to the poor. The cinematography is vibrant as well, as the screen is littered with the rich tomatoes, floral dresses and a top-angle view of Penelope Cruz assets. All done on purpose and beautifully definitely.There are many 'woman' issues ¬ñ from motherhood, single hood, sister hood, self worth and independence. Male actors are almost non-existence, playing only bit parts and there is no hint of any impending love stories. Perhaps this is also why I didn't identify much with this movie. For the males, do not worry as Volver isn't any soapy melodrama. With its twists and fun, it is still an enjoyable comedy about second chances.Volver ¬ñ The women scores, and so does Penelope http://themovieclub.blogspot.com"

Forced to accept a job in a school of a tough underprivileged suburb, he finds himself confronted to his own limits.","As teacher, I saw this real good film as a too deja vu. the differences , the adaptation, the challenges, the sentimental problems, the discover of students step by step, the vulnerability of the position of front to the class, the social problems and the options. for the others could be a nice film. and that is not a wrong impression. the humor, the spices of French cinema are good points. and, sure, the performances. but for me, it remains a smart, maybe too unrealistic in few scenes, portrait of the life of a teacher."

Bridget Jones's Baby,2016,6.4,"Bridget Jones' focus on her single and professional life is interrupted when she discovers she is pregnant, but is unsure of the identity of the father.","Like many I was very happy but skeptical when I heard the news of a third entry in the Bridget Jones series. It had been 12 years since the last film, The Edge of Reason, which deviated severely from its source material in the worst way possible and Helen Fielding had put out an awful third book Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, which seemed to destroy everything I loved about the series.First off: Bridget Jones's Baby is NOT an adaptation of Mad About the Boy, but its own zany creation. Second of all it's actually surprisingly good. Despite a 12 year gap Renee Zellweger slips into her Bridget persona flawlessly. She's able to anchor the film so that it still feels like a Bridget Jones film while introducing new characters like Jack Quant, a man Bridget instantly has a spark with at a music festival, and Sarah Solemani as Bridget's colleague and single friend, Miranda. Sharon Maguire (who directed the first Bridget film and was the inspiration for Shazzer), returns and seems able to get the best out of her cast.The film sees Bridget, now turning 43, as a successful news producer who is still single and childless. Deciding to embrace her state as a single spinster she goes to a music festival where she meets a handsome man about her age, and sleeps with him. A little while later, when at her godchild's christening, she runs into Mark Darcy, new divorced from the wife he married after they split up, and as sparks fly, she sleeps with him too, only to remember in the morning all the reasons they split up as he never had time with her and was always focused on work. Soon after she discovers she's pregnant with the titular baby.A huge part of the success of the film is down to the script which holds contributions from notorious wit Emma Thompson. It's really quite funny, but also has a lot of character bits so we believe in these characters and their decisions. The explanation for why Bridget and Darcy aren't together feels organic and real. Similarly the movie does a great job of showing who these characters would be 12 years on. Bridget has grown and figures out things in life while still keeping sense of humour and being a clumsy mess in certain situations. Rather than appearing haughty, Mark comes across as painfully shy, a careful man who now has many regrets from all the chances he didn't take.It's a wonderful, sweet movie, and a wonderful end to the Bridget Jones series."
The Lego Batman Movie,2017,7.3,"A cooler-than-ever Bruce Wayne must deal with the usual suspects as they plan to rule Gotham City, while discovering that he has accidentally adopted a teenage orphan who wishes to become his sidekick.","My daughter has read a lot of Batman comics and she loved the film...and much of it was because she saw all sorts of inside jokes that the rest of us might miss. Fortunately, you do NOT need to be a Batmaniac in order to enjoy the movie, as a dopey old man like myself still got a lot out of the film. As for me, I was thrilled to see a Batman Lego movie, as in ""The Lego Movie"" this character was my favorite. Here, he's back...as broody and aloof as ever.The plot is pretty simple. The Joker is angry that Batman doesn't care about him nor does he see him as his personal nemesis. So, the Joker is out to hurt Batman by unleashing all sorts of wicked creatures on Gotham City. As for Batman, the self-centered jerk superhero learns to rely on others...starting with Dick Grayson, Barbara Gordon and Alfred.This is pretty much what you'd expect from the film...one that kids will no doubt enjoy and adults will enjoy or at least tolerate. To me, the best kids films are the ones with wide appeal....and it's hard to imagine anyone not liking this cute film."
These Final Hours,2013,6.6,"A self-obsessed young man makes his way to the party-to-end-all-parties on the last day on Earth, but ends up saving the life of a little girl searching for her father. Their relationship ultimately leads him on the path to redemption.","I did not see a good Australian film, I am not sure for how long. Finally a great film comes by. I enjoyed it very much. Great cast of characters, great acting, especially by the principal actor. Story is interesting, although I saw many apocalyptic films on the same theme before. That idea is as old as the film itself.I am glad that film is set in Perth, it is one of great Australian cities, although a little bit isolated. Editing makes Ice arena and Library close by, although they are not in the reality.I strongly recommend that you see this film. Good Australian films are few and far between. Not only because of that, but if you are interested in the apocalyptic films, this one is definitely for you!"
Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,2002,7.0,"An adaptation of the cult memoir of game show impresario Chuck Barris (Sam Rockwell), in which he purports to have been a C.I.A. hitman.","While quite very obviously a well crafted lie sold as truth this movie does not fail to entertain and was one of the more underrated films of the year of it's release. A commercial failure the film was re-released later based on word of mouth buzz. This film appeals to a fringe audience that remains just out of reach of mainstream films. What do you expect from a screenplay written by Charlie Kaufmann? This film is a telling of the story of Chuck Barris, creator of various TV shows and all around uncomfortable guy. Barris holds many stations in life, TV producer, songwriter and CIA assassin. The meat of this story is not so much in his occupations but the mental condition and back story of Barris throughout the film. With something lurking just below the surface of an ambiguous nature you aren't certain if you should root for Barris or despise him.Through various twists and turns you follow what is one half mockumentary and one half spy thriller the film plays it very loose and fast and it let's your mind run wild and free without the burden of tension that a spy thriller would give. Definitely worth a watch if you enjoy strong acting performances mixed with offbeat plots.Clooney takes what is basically a poor mans ""THE KID STAYS IN THE PICTURE"" and makes a very entertaining and watchable film with great acting and stylish but reigned in technique. Finally a someone takes the theory of taking a bad idea and making a fine film and makes good."
"Mujeres al borde de un ataque de ""nervios""",1988,7.5,A television actress encounters a variety of eccentric characters after embarking on a journey to discover why her lover abruptly left her.,"What does spiked gazpacho, a suitcase, and a crazy woman with a gun have in common? Not much, at first glance, unless you are in the head of director Pedro Almodovar. In his film Mujeres al borde de un ataque de nervios, Pedro mixes apparently unconnected objects and events that make no sense until the film is over. His direction and distinct style combined with good actors makes a movie as unforgettable as it is foreign. The basic plot deals with one day in the life of Pepa Marcos, played by Carmen Maura. During the day, we meet her lover, Ivan, who has a son, Carlos, whose girlfriend is Marisa, but like his father, Carlos is not loyal to Marisa but would rather kiss whoever walk in front of him, like Candela, Pepa's friend. All of the opposing motives create and tense mood, but besides everything is seems that Pepa knows what is going on and only worries about Ivan. The main subject is the destructive cycle of machismo and the women that are trapped by it. There are three girls and have fallen in love with one man that really doesn't love any of them, but only as temporary lovers. The tragedy is that the women don't realize this except Pepa who ends her relationships with Ivan. Even though she doesn't love Ivan anymore, we see with her conversation with Marisa, that she has not given up her love for machismo, but that she wants the telephone repairman. In my opinion, what makes this film good is the direction by Almodovar. I have never seen a style so distinct and interesting like his. The settings are familiar, but at the same time the colors create another world, like the world of Oz. One scene that captures this is when Pepa talks with Lucia on the phone and we can only see their faces and bright backgrounds. This is just a small example, but the attention to detail is the most important job to a director, and Almodovar has done it well. I recommend the move to anyone that wants to try something new, even though it was filmed in 1988. I think that anyone can relate to at least one role, especially because of the great acting. The film could give us a new look on our concept of love while keeping an open mind."
Kong: Skull Island,2017,6.7,"After the Vietnam war, a team of scientists explores an uncharted island in the Pacific, venturing into the domain of the mighty Kong and must fight to escape a primal Eden.","Looking back at old movies, the effects date quickly and they become rather cheesy in their simple pleasures. Someday I will do that with this film, because essentially it is a creature feature, albeit one that happens to be being delivered with the biggest stars, biggest budget, and state-of-the-art effects. And the thing is, despite all this superficial polish, the film is essentially big monsters and spectacle.On this front it is enjoyable though; it has plenty of action, lots to look at, and a reasonably successful mix of humor and drama. I say reasonably, because the plot isn't up to much, and different characters seem to be in different films depending on who they are. This is matched by the performances which range from the silly fun (Reilly) to the stupidly OTT (Jackson) to the starry but bland (Hiddleston, Larson); the film doesn't seem to have a handle on what it wants to do, and the mix that it produces is not always successful, and it relies on big moments of action and noise to try and cover it. Perhaps at some point there was some smart commentary about US foreign policy in there, but that is lost in the mix too.Still, it works as a monster movie with great effects and lots of polish, so enjoy it for that even if there is not too much beyond that."
Goodbye Christopher Robin,2017,7.1,"The relationship between writer AA Milne and his son, Christopher Robin, and how this became the inspiration for Winnie the Pooh.","Not having any serious connection with Pooh, Tigger, Piglet and the rest of the children's story, Winnie the Pooh, I am perhaps even more ready than its devotees to admire Goodbye Christopher Robin. It's a biopic of great sensitivity that mixes nostalgia for the most popular children's book ever with the harshness of two world wars and the practice of parents leaving their children with nannies in the first quarter of the 20th century.I now wish I had a stronger relationship with those little critters and that lovable boy, for I could have used the distraction from the aftermath of WWII just as Pooh was able to do for the world after the war to end all wars. Author A.A. Milne (a stoic and yet lovable Domhnall Gleeson) was traumatized by his service in the war, and moved slowly to erase that PTSD while creating Pooh. The film spends too much time on his trauma, but it does help fill out Milne's character.Yet, this is the story of Billy Moon (a remarkably-dimpled, serene Will Tilston), as Christopher Robin is called in real life, who supplies his dad with inspirations for the book. The film centers on remote dad's growing love for the boy and the book while remote mom goes off to London to do who knows what. The film carefully shows how children might be lucky to have a nanny like Neu (Kelly Macdonald) to give them love and some creative inspiration along the way.Goodbye Christopher Robin is a successful biopic because it doesn't spare the story of anti-helicopter parents who endanger the mental health of their children with their absences. As fame overtakes the Milne family, the film still relays the sense of wonderment Billy had as a child immersed in love of his forest, animals, and imagination.The biopic may be counter to what we expected of a world-renowned author of a book for children. That he had difficulty initially interacting with his own child is unusual, but the film is successful showing how he warms up and creates a masterpiece as well.Though not always a feel good movie, Goodbye Christopher Robin makes you wish he'd never go away. It looks like he never will."
Solaris,1972,7.9,A psychologist is sent to a station orbiting a distant planet in order to discover what has caused the crew to go insane.,"Shame on me for not realisng the 2002 film with George Clooney was essentially a remake of a Russian film made 30 years previously. I ought to have known, I am that sort of person.So comes December 2009, and Film 4 show both Solaris films. I sat transfixed by the Russian film. Visually it is a thing of beauty, and it is a rare thing - a film which requires input from the viewer. This movie requires you to think for yourself...and some people find that difficult.I enjoy a rip-snorting entertaining action movie as much as most people, but rare films like Solaris leave me feeling so much more fulfilled. There are ambiguities, not so much loose ends untied as dots which the viewer is required to connect for himself.Try Solaris. If you find yourself twiddling your thumbs after 15 minutes then its probably not for you. If you find yourself glued to the screen then you know how I feel about this film."
The Believer,2001,7.1,A young Jewish man develops a fiercely anti-Semitic philosophy. Based on the factual story of a K.K.K. member in the 1960s who was revealed to be Jewish by a New York Times reporter.,"Danny Balint (Ryan Gosling) is angry. He questions his Jewish heritage and challenges his faith. The movie starts with him bullying a Jewish boy on the subway in New York. He joins a small group of fascists led by Curtis Zampf (Billy Zane) and Lina Moebius (Theresa Russell). Danny pushes for the group to start killing Jews. Carla Moebius (Summer Phoenix) finds him fascinating. Curtis doesn't want to go down that road again while Lina finds it appealing for their cause even if she doesn't believe in it. Reporter Guy Danielsen is writing about the right wing movement. Danny joins up with others as his star rises in the movement.This is a character study of anger and self-hatred. Ryan Gosling is brilliantly unbalanced as he challenges religious authority. He's also superficially very convincing in his insane rants. More than anything, he's very charismatic. It is a bone chilling performance."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,2017,6.4,"A dark force threatens Alpha, a vast metropolis and home to species from a thousand planets. Special operatives Valerian and Laureline must race to identify the marauding menace and safeguard not just Alpha, but the future of the universe.","I expected much much more...especially from LB.So much potential in the story but the actors, dialogs and main characters simply didnt do the job.It could have been one of the best movies but in the end its nothing....such potential, such visuals, such story...all went down the drain."
The Great Wall,2016,5.9,"In ancient China, a group of European mercenaries encounters a secret army that maintains and defends the Great Wall of China against a horde of monstrous creatures.","From the description I read of the movie, it sounded kind of strange and I wasn't sure it was something I really wanted to watch. I'm glad I did. It's an old legend or story. Is it real? I don't know, is Santa Claus real? Does it matter if it is true or accurate? Not to me, it is a well written movie with some incredible action. The visuals are stunning to say the least. The costumes are incredible and I am very happy that most of the movie wasn't filmed in the dark which seems to have become the habit of Hollywood these past few years.It is sad to see Matt Damon growing old but he still did a great job, I wonder how long he's going to be able to keep up doing physically demanding roles. If I am totally honest I would have liked the movie with a younger man in the lead role, that would have been a little more believable to me.I totally recommend this movie, it has fantasy, action a tiny bit of romance so your girl can appreciate it, most of all it raises a lot of emotion. There were several times during the movie I was on the edge of my seat holding my breath anticipating the next moment."
The Graduate,1967,8.0,A disillusioned college graduate finds himself torn between his older lover and her daughter.,"What a ride....This is a perfect example of what art can generate if one puts soul and wit into it. Firstly, I find human emotions and life issues depicted in a bitter-comic manner to be a charming combination.Love,sex,insecurity,family relationships,shyness,deception are treated with great humor and witty dialog in this movie.Long and elaborated shots,incredible story-telling creativity (like 1-st person camera views,long still frames,distance frames),video-clip like sequences (beautifully sustained by Simon and Garfunkel's heart-warming poetry and sad irony).There is enough creative film work in The Graduate to suffice for 10 movies.The dialog is excellent and the acting pure genius.And, oh...the time frame...the sixties...don't get me started.The 2000's are like an insurance seminar compared to that... No need to praise this movie anymore, it speaks for itself.It is not,however,a movie for the masses.This is no Ben-Hur type of flick,with spectacular imagery and epic storyline.It is an epic of the inner soul.It requires a bit of meditation, it is only entertaining if you get in touch with your inner self and not expect to watch the screen and BE entertained. Despite its comic appearance,I always felt that it touched a sensitive somehow sad chord in me.It's kinda like:""Haha very funny, but I felt those type of emotions and they didn't seem funny then.""It's also so easy to laugh at other people's feelings,torments and emotions, but when you realize that you are also part of that old human comedy and drama, your laughing becomes more restrained.More mature.I always connected with this movie, and with Mike Nichols.Too bad they don't make'em like this anymore.We live in an era where people like John Woo and Michael Bay are starting to dictate what we will be watching more and more.What a shame...."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,2017,6.7,"Robbed of his birthright, Arthur comes up the hard way in the back alleys of the city. But once he pulls the sword from the stone, he is forced to acknowledge his true legacy - whether he likes it or not.","The elephant in the room is... well, there are lots of elephants in the room; let's be honest.Before I expound further, let me say this: if you like the movie's trailers, like a fair bit of action but don't particularly care about how every bit of it fits into a story, don't particularly care about the traditional legend(s) of King Arthur, like a bunch of fantasy mixed in, and plenty of (now run-of-the-mill) CGI, you might like this movie. Reading further may unnecessarily dissuade you from watching it.Of course, if you've seen the trailers, you know that there really are (ridiculously large, CGI) elephants in the film. The other, proverbial, elephants in the room are how far the movie strays from the legendary King Arthur story.Now, in fairness, legends (King Arthur, in this case) being what they are, it is difficult to know where reality ends and fantasy begins. Nonetheless, even though the legend has changed somewhat over the years (as legends are wont to do), this movie bears little resemblance to the story that moviegoers familiar with Arthur will expect.Merlin? Rendered unimportant and replaced by a (gender-PC?) beautiful female mage, who remains nameless. (I suppose the lack of a name was supposed to lend some air of irresistible mystery to her. It failed, miserably.) (sigh)Bedivere, the handsomest of Arthur's knights (almost in the entire land), one-handed, he of the muscular build? Well, at least he had the build. Some, including Bedivere, were obviously cast in a fit of PC multiculturalism. Please. Save it for where it makes sense.Guinevere? Lancelot? Missing. David Beckham managed to land a spot, though. Go figure.I read Ritchie's bio here on IMDb. It's stated there that Ritchie thought film school graduates made ""boring and unwatchable"" films. His disdain for the work of others seems to go beyond those who've studied film art. Huh. That doesn't stop Ritchie from leaning on the creations of others to sell a flick.Ritchie has a flashy -- often manic -- presentation style. I'll give him some benefit of doubt in presuming that he does so in an effort to create a sense of action. Unfortunately, it often serves more to make stories incoherent.In watching Richie's Sherlock Holmes re-imaginings, I couldn't shake a feeling of Ritchie's lack of respect for Doyles' Holmes. I get the same sense of lack of respect for traditional tales of King Arthur.I could go on and on, picking the film apart, but all of it boils down to the simple appearance that Ritchie is simply capitalizing on the popularity of someone else' story -- King Arthur and the legend of Excalibur -- by using the name in the title, then remaking the entire story to suit a flight of his fancy.Ritchie might as well have just left the sword out of the story and dropped the name of Arthur from the story -- and title. Then he could have gone anywhere he wanted with the story without disappointing moviegoers drawn in by the title. It might have stood on its own as a fair (by no means great) action/fantasy film. As a retelling of the King Arthur legend, it is a disappointment.On second thought, considering Richie sold the idea to the movie studio as King-Arthur-meets-The-Lord-of-the-Rings, perhaps he should have just named the movie accordingly. Then the Tolkien influence (and the use of Tolkien's oliphants) would make much more sense. Then, too, moviegoers would know better than to expect a movie simply about the King Arthur legend, which the current title implies."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,2017,6.7,"After the Kingsman's headquarters is destroyed and the world is held hostage, an allied spy organization in the United States is discovered. These two elite secret agencies must band together to defeat a common enemy.","First movie was great fun, this one is utterly awful.

"Roman J. Israel, Esq.",2017,6.5,"Roman J. Israel, Esq., a driven, idealistic defense attorney, finds himself in a tumultuous series of events that lead to a crisis and the necessity for extreme action.","It was a good movie, but a tad confusing. DW is just as good as ever, it's worth watching. The movie was a little slow, but still not bad. If your a Hard core DW fan its worth a watch, but for a casual movie fan id say you can pass on it."
The Man from Earth,2007,7.8,An impromptu goodbye party for Professor John Oldman becomes a mysterious interrogation after the retiring scholar reveals to his colleagues he has a longer and stranger past than they can imagine.,It is a work that has a wonderful and thought-provoking conversation in the spaces within the scope of a room. Having fun with the permeables that they put together in long conversations with a topic that can be lived in a conversation in a way that is fun.
You Don't Know Jack,,7.5,A look at the life and work of doctor-assisted suicide advocate Jack Kevorkian.,"I've seen ""You Don't Know Jack"" twice now and will certainly watch it several times more with friends coming to watch my DVR HD recording of this HBO TV movie. It's not easy to watch the harrowing scenes of terminal patients in great distress. But with an outstandingly intelligent script, first-class cinematography and stellar performances by all the actors it becomes compelling viewing. Like Marion Cotillard's portrayal of Edith Piaf in ""La Vie en Rose"", Pacino's incredible performance will leave us with the feeling that he has indeed become Dr Kevorkian for us. His powerful acting gains pace as the movie progresses until the final dramatic courtroom scenes end the remarkable story of a pioneer eccentric's human rights obsession. While overtly sympathetic to Kevorkian, all sides of the arguments for or against assisted suicide are fairly presented and leave one thinking about the subject for days. In addition to Pacino's tour de force role I think that Barry Levinson's inspired direction brings this movie to masterpiece status. I hope it will be released on DVD soon so that a much wider audience can see it."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,2017,6.9,Rey develops her abilities with the help of Luke Skywalker as the Resistance prepares for battle against the First Order.,"Reviewers say 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' garners varied reactions, with praise for its innovative storytelling, stunning visuals, and complex character arcs, especially Rey and Kylo Ren. It is celebrated for pushing Star Wars boundaries but criticized for plot inconsistencies and character missteps. The portrayal of Luke Skywalker and new characters sparks debate, alongside mixed opinions on humor and pacing. Despite the backlash, the film is acknowledged for its ambition and bold narrative direction within the Star Wars universe."
Last Vegas,2013,6.6,"Billy, Paddy, Archie and Sam have been best friends since childhood. When Billy proposes to his much-younger girlfriend, they go to Vegas to relive their glory days. However, the decades have changed Sin City and tested their friendship.","The buddy comedy genre has entertained audiences for years, and ""Last Vegas"" adds a unique flavor by following the adventures of four childhood friends on a vacation. With a mix of humor and unexpected twists, the film takes a fresh approach, centering around four retired buddies throwing a bachelor party in the dazzling city of Las Vegas.As anticipated, Las Vegas serves as a sensational backdrop, allowing the talented cast to shine. Morgan Freeman once again showcases his versatility and undeniable talent amidst the stellar ensemble. The charming chemistry between Diana (Mary Steenburgen) and Billy (Michael Douglas) adds an endearing touch to the story.Last Vegas"" is a satisfying watch. It offers plenty of laughs although it could have benefited from more significant conflicts. Surprisingly, there is absence of antagonists, and it is a loophole, there are very few conflicts.I would rate it 7.5/10 for delivering an enjoyable experience. While a more substantial conflict beyond the issues between best friends could have added depth, it still stands as a commendable buddy comedy, though not the absolute best in its genre."
Going in Style,2017,6.6,"Desperate to pay their bills and support their loved ones, lifelong pals Willy Davis, Albert Gardner, and Joe Harding risk it all by robbing the bank that absconded with the pension money that they earned from working there for years.","Let's hope not, for a long time. While it's not a perfect movie, the 3 leads are so charismatic, they carry anything the movie throws at them. Some things may bit coincidental and may feel too convenient, but again you won't be thinking about that while watching the movie. You know a couple of things just by watching the movie and you can almost guess the ""twists"" entirely.That still doesn't take away too much of the fun you can have while watching it. Dialog is nice and they play into the generation thing (social media, wordplay and of course limitations of age). But all in a really respectful way and yet still funny. If you like to have a good old time (no pun intended), you could do worse"
Cop Land,1997,7.0,"The Sheriff of a suburban New Jersey community, populated by New York City police officers, slowly discovers the town is a front for mob connections and corruption.","In their only joint film Sylvester Stallone and Robert DeNiro star in Cop Land, a story about Garrison, New Jersey a small town where an overabundance of NYPD officers reside. So much so that the place is called Cop Land and they have the run of the place.As the official law in Cop Land the boys in blue have selected a wannabe. Sylvester Stallone who lost the hearing in one ear saving a drowning woman Annabella Sciorra is the police chief. Other than rescuing cats and issuing speeding tickets, but never to the NYPD residents of his town all Stallone does is stand in awe of the people who have the career he wanted.This whole set up comes tumbling down during a shootout at the George Washington Bridge where Michael Rappaport shoots two black teens, two stupid ones I might add who point something at him he mistakes for an automatic weapon. The NYPD citizens of Cop Land do what they can to cover up the incident, but it all blows up in their faces.Robert DeNiro who is an internal affairs detective has been looking into the cop residents of Garrison for some time. He tries to recruit Stallone, but Stallone has to see for himself what his 'friends' are really like.Stallone does one of the best acting jobs in his career. He most assuredly is not playing super hero Rambo or even working class hero Rocky in this. He's a flawed man physically and emotionally and the Garrison NYPD colony don't take him seriously at all. That's part of their downfall.Besides those already mentioned I would single out Harvey Keitel as the unofficial head of the Garrison cop colony. The more the story unfolds the more frightening Keitel becomes. Cathy Moriarty-Gentile as Keitel's abused wife, Ray Liotta who develops a conscience about what is going on and Frank Vincent as the police union head who is the ultimate target in the Cop Land probe from Internal Affairs.But it's Stallone who is the real revelation here. It's a different Sly than fans of Rocky and Rambo know."
Conspiracy,,7.6,"At the Wannsee Conference on January 20, 1942, senior Nazi officials meet to determine the manner in which the so-called ""Final Solution to the Jewish Question"" can be best implemented.","Conspiracy debuted on HBO in 2001 and centers on the infamous Wannsee conference, where fifteen high-ranking officials of Nazi Germany government and military devised the final solution of the Jewish problem in Europe. The meeting took place in a beautiful house in rural Germany, where food and wine were served, and ideas were born.This film is the best World War II era film i have ever seen, and one of the best movies i have seen, period. The cast is mostly unknown, but out-act any all-star cast Hollywood has ever produced. Kenneth Branaugh delivers an excellent performance as Heydrich, the head of the table at the meeting. He threatens people with a smile on his face, and barely bats an eye while speaking of killing thousands of people. Stanley Tucci is also great as the party-planner Eichmann, who set up the entire meeting, from the venue to the food to the topics. The way he counts the number of Jews that can be exterminated in a a given period of time is downright creepy. The cast also includes great turns by Colin Firth, a lawyer and professor who thinks the systematic slaughter of the Jews is bad for Germany's future, and Ian McNiece, who plays a hateful and witty official.The dialogue is smart, funny, and chilling, and contains some jabs at all sides of the biggest war in Earth's history. This is a great movie to show in a history class, before watching a bunch of war movies, or if you just have an interest in the war. It teaches a lot more about the time than Saving Private Ryan (great movie too, but really one-sided), and features the best acting this side of the Godfather.---9/10"
Rocky III,1982,6.9,"Rocky faces the ultimate challenge from a powerful new contender, and must turn to a former rival to help regain his throne as the undisputed fighting champion.","Despite the familiar narrative, Rocky III is still a great third installment that's funny, emotional and thrilling. Sylvester Stallone gives an incredible performance once again and his direction is great. Carl Weathers, Talia Shire and Mr. T are all great. It's extremely well filmed with intense and visceral fight scenes. It's also expertly paced and the music by Bill Conti is really good."
Cliffhanger,1993,6.5,Two mountain rescuers are forced to guide a group of thieves to their missing loot.,"Sly's best out and out action film. It is a superbly enjoyable movie with some interesting characters, solid performances and Renny Harlins direction is stylishly assured. Stallone is rarely this interesting in his action films and he certainly looks the part in terms of the action scenes. This was one of the best action films of the year and one of the most thrilling and enjoyable of the 90's, a definite genre classic. As a Stallone fan this is one I look back on with fond memories. Plenty of superb action and Sly in prime action man form. Action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the hallmarks that make a good aciton film. The film looks great and there is great support from Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow. ****"
First Blood,1982,7.7,Green Beret veteran Rambo takes on a Pacific Northwest sheriff and the National Guard.,"The ultimate action film and the ultimate psychological thriller! 'First Blood' was among others like 'Die Hard' as being one of the first action films I saw when I was younger, I even owned it on VHS. This film has Sly showing off his acting ability (which is saying something for an actor with such little capability of ""acting"") as the iconic John Rambo in the film that sparked off the eponymous film franchise, whilst the sequels were heavily classified as flops, 'First Blood' is a daring and thrilling survival adventure that follows a Vietnam Vet and the post-war trauma he suffers from. A dark yet sensitive film that follows one of the great action stars as he fights to survive, a mesmerising action masterpiece."
Demolition Man,1993,6.7,A police officer is brought out of suspended animation in prison to pursue an old ultra-violent nemesis who is loose in a non-violent future society.,"This film's depiction of what society may become always struck a chord with me. The extreme side of PC culture is something growing at this very moment and it was amazing to see this idea conveyed so well for the time of it's release in 1993. The casting was perfect, Snipes was a great villain and to me Sandra Bullock stole the show with her jovial demeanor and comic relief as Stallone's partner. The advanced tech seemed very realistic for the time and the story itself was very original. The action scenes and stunt work were very big budget with nothing held back. Hand to hand, gunfights, car chases, explosions and one liners, this movie has it all so I was surprised by the sort of low rating the critics gave it. Definitely a solid 7.5/10."
Assassins,1995,6.3,Professional hit-man Robert Rath wants to fulfill a few more contracts before retiring but unscrupulous ambitious newcomer hit-man Miguel Bain keeps killing Rath's targets.,"This movie is very entertaining and has appropriate amount of action and suspense. The action sequences are great and the interactions between Stallone and Banderas excellent. If you're a fan of action films, this one is definitely worth a watch."
The Deer Hunter,1978,8.1,The lives of a group of friends are forever changed by the Vietnam War.,"Reviewers say 'The Deer Hunter' is a powerful film with strong performances, especially from Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken. It delves into the Vietnam War's impact on individuals and communities, praised for its storytelling and emotional depth. However, it faces criticism for pacing, length, and Vietnamese depiction. Some find it overrated and long, while others see it as a timeless masterpiece. Cinematography and direction by Michael Cimino are lauded."
Judge Dredd,1995,5.6,"In a dystopian future, Joseph Dredd, the most famous Judge (a police officer with instant field judiciary powers), is convicted for a crime he did not commit and must face his murderous counterpart.","It has a very bad reviews maybe... but trust me this is one very fun action sci fi movie... it may have some unnecessary and cheesy scenes but from beginning to end is fun and enjoyable flick.
7/10"
Tango & Cash,1989,6.4,"Framed by their ruthless arch-nemesis, a pair of mismatched LAPD officers must put their differences aside to get even with the brutal crime baron who sent them to rot in a maximum-security prison.","Okay, so this isn't the greatest film ever made. In fact, it isn't even remotely the best buddy-buddy flick ever made. But surprisingly enough, this is actually quite a winner, and succeeds far more in being a parody of the Lethal-Weapon style films than say... Loaded Weapon does. This is for several reasons.Firstly, Stallone is the star of the show here, turning in a self-mocking parody of his own screen persona. He is flash and indestructable, yet the film acknowledges and exploits this to comedic ends. Secondly, Palance is excellent as a sneering and menacing bad guy, plotting the two cops downfall. He deserved more screen time than he actually got, and actually did a good job of being the obligatory stereotypical bad-guy.However, the best thing of all about this film is the snappy dialogue. There is so much good banter between the two-cops that no matter how bizarre the film's scenario's get, the dialogue rescues it.The first time I saw this, I enjoyed it and was only really let down by the ending, which feels hollow and unsatisfying in comparison to the first two reels of the film. However, this nagging problem alone, I have no hesitation in recommending this to any fan of the action-genre.Overall: 6 1/2 out of 10."
Irr√©versible,2002,7.3,Events over the course of one traumatic night in Paris unfold in reverse-chronological order.,"When his girlfriend Alex is brutally raped in an underpass, boyfriend Marcus and Alex's ex-boyfriend Pierre are approached by a couple of criminal types who claim to know who did it and lead Marcus on the path to revenge via hookers and a man in a brutal gay club known as the Rectum.I shan't waste my time or yours by writing more of a plot to this film than that because this is all quite thin stuff. Normally I find myself gradually engaged by a film as it develops characters and stories however with Irr√©versible I was gripped immediately but the effect worked in reverse, just like the film. Others have asked why this film is told backwards, with some waxing lyrical about the film demonstrating the nature of actions and consequences. I don't buy this and I almost believe that the film is structured this way because No√© knows that his film is not good enough to engage the audience with the development of the story and characters to the point where they would still care by the end. Whereas, by starting with his biggest and most impacting sequences he has preventing the audience thinking ""this is going nowhere"" by putting us right where it is going to.Of course what this means is that the film genuinely has nowhere to go to because the developmental issue is still there ¬ñ albeit the need to see roots rather than branches. With this there is nothing and I felt myself becoming more and more disappointed with the film as it went on as it seemed to offer nothing but missed potential. Unlike Memento (which was a thriller with the reason being to find out what caused the end), Irr√©versible's ending is an act of violence and revenge that, in essence occurs out of bad fortune rather than a series of events that are worth holding out for. With this in mind the focus comes more on the characters and their relationships to find a reason to make the impacting opening to the film feel that much more impacting. Sadly it does fall down and despite some interesting stuff that might have gone somewhere (if not to the actual crime), themes of sexual intimacy, differences in men and women and so on are just suggested but never delivered upon and my interest and respect for the film waned frighteningly quickly.It is a terrible shame because the film had initially won me over quickly. With the first shots of spinning camera, ""irrelevant"" men and disorientating delivery I prepared myself to hate this film and slate it for being pretentious. This feeling didn't subside much as we were thrown into a gay club ending with an intensely brutal scene of violence that quite sickened me. The reason for this is almost the following scene where we see the beautiful and classy Alex brutally and meaninglessly sodomised on the floor of a dirty underpass for no other reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time and the wrong sex. With my eyes at the time I found these scenes to be quite brilliant but finding out later there was nothing beyond them I take a dimmer view. In his defence, No√©'s sequences should not be mentioned in the same breath as the recent Holly wood trend for torture porn because there is nothing erotic here. The rape scene in particular is disturbing, sickening and based on violence, certainly not sex, attraction or arousal. Some comments on IMDb have disturbed me and shown that some people will still ""enjoy"" these scenes ¬ñ one particular comment saying ""fans of rape movie will appreciate"" the sequence I felt was in particular poor taste. However for me it is as effective as it is unpleasant, No√© does not adopt the angles, style or nudity of pornography and indeed leaves the camera on the floor and lets the actors deliver an experience that is undeniably cruel and wrong. Viewers who chose to get off on that will do so however for those of us not stimulated by the violent degradation of another the effect will be harrowing.The cast are good where they are caught up in things. Cassel is convincing in his revenge scenes but has less to work with in the later (earlier) scenes. Likewise Bellucci is amazing in her key scene; utterly convincing and heart-wrenching in her agony and I can only imagine how difficult it was for her to shoot. Dupontel is interesting but his performance would have benefited from going from innocence to violence and not the other way round. Prestia is a convincing human version of Satan, who is sickeningly real. No√©'s direction is impressive even if his ability as writer is not. His camera earlier on matches the frantic violent mood of his characters but gradually calms down. Quite what he is saying with where the film goes or how it ends is beyond me but by then he had done sufficiently little to convince that I shouldn't worry myself too much.Overall an impacting ""experience"" film that starts out with the potential to be a challenging and difficult art film. However with nothing past these scenes of significant value, the backward telling just seems like a way of having the ""big"" scenes before losing the audience, rather than afterwards and for all my appreciation and admiration for his intense and creative technique as director, I found No√© the writer to be lacking. In summary I'm not sure if I liked this or not or if it is worth seeing but it is certainly an experience that should be seen by those looking for a diverse taste of cinema whether it is ""enjoyable"" or not."
Billions,,8.3,A complex drama about power politics in the world of New York high finance.,"The first two seasons of this show are some of the best TV I've watched. The battle between Axe and Chuck (two awesome lead characters) is thrilling, engaging stuff and there are some interesting sub-plots too. At one point it was one of my favourite shows of all time.I was immensely excited for where this show would go but unfortunately it has ended up being a major disappointment. The writers went away from the rivalry that drove S1 and S2 and pushed the unbearable Taylor Mason as the lead character. Once they did that, this show started to go downhill. Season 3 was okay but S4 was utter garbage and now I don't care about the story.This show is a perfect example of greed and political correctness ruining what was once a brilliant show. Such a shame"
Ready Player One,2018,7.4,"When the creator of a virtual reality called the OASIS dies, he makes a posthumous challenge to all OASIS users to find his Easter Egg, which will give the finder his fortune and control of his world.","Reviewers say 'Ready Player One' is visually stunning with impressive effects and nostalgic pop culture references, yet criticized for diverging from the novel and lacking depth. The film entertains with its homage to classics but is faulted for a weak storyline and underdeveloped characters. Performances by Mark Rylance and Ben Mendelsohn are praised, though the lead roles are seen as lacking. Overall, it offers a fun yet shallow experience, making it a mixed bag for audiences."
Gandhi,1982,8.0,The life of the lawyer who became the famed leader of the Indian revolts against the British rule through his philosophy of nonviolent protest.,"In her diary entry of Saturday, February 27, 1943, Anne Frank wrote in passing (translated from the Dutch):  ""The freedom-loving Gandhi of India is holding his umpteenth fast.""It's a comment at once mildly comical and respectfully admiring, one I think the Mahatma would have appreciated with a twinkle and a laugh.  He and Miss Frank are linked with the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., as the civil rights spokesperson-giants of the 20th century.  And civil rights, and the reversal of the institutionalized violation of the same, are a large part of what the last century's politics were all about.  Movie viewers are apt to find in the diary remark a distillation of their experience of the Richard Attenborough film.  A recommendation is that it be followed by rentals of Saving Private Ryan and The Long Walk Home, which together convey the investment put into the respective causes the trio represented.At the beginning of Gandhi we confront these words:  ""No man's life can be encompassed in one telling.  There is no way to give each year its allotted weight, to include each event, each person who helped to shape a lifetime. What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record, and to try to find one's way to the heart of the man....""John Briley's screenplay accomplishes that faithfulness, and one probably has to be a scholar of the subject to sort out what is his and what is Gandhi's.  Not that it really is of relevance, given what we learn from the movie about the value of eclecticism.  Looking out over the bay at Porbandar, Gandhi (Ben Kingsley) tells Walker (Martin Sheen):  ""The temple where you were yesterday is of my family's sect, the Pranami.  It was Hindu of course, but the priests used to read from the Muslim Koran and the Hindu Gita, moving from one to the other as though it mattered not at all which book was read as long as God was worshipped.""  In a preceding scene, similarly, confronted by young toughs on a South African street, Gandhi defends for his Christian friend Charlie (Ian Charleson) the New Testament intelligence of turning the other cheek.  A worried Charlie states, ""I think perhaps the phrase was used metaphorically.  I don't think our Lord meant...,"" and is interrupted by a movie shot of the approaching menace. Gandhi replies calmly, ""I'm not so certain.  I have thought about it a great deal.  I suspect he meant you must show courage--be willing to take a blow--several blows--to show you will not strike back--nor will you be turned aside....  And when you do that it calls upon something...that makes...hate for you diminish and...respect increase.  I think Christ grasped that and I...have seen it work.""The script is replete with these kinds of memorable words, and with others that reflect its subject's political acumen and strategical cleverness.Kingsley is sublime in the lead role.  Saeed Jaffrey, Roshan Seth, and Alyque Padamsee do well as Gandhi's pro-independence collaborators.  Ditto, Athol Fugard (""Assuming we are in agreement?"") and John Gielgud (""Salt?"") as two of his adversaries.  Charleson, in his clerical collar, looks like he has walked in off the set of the preceding year's Academy Award winner, Chariots of Fire (where he played the Scottish sprinter-missionary, Eric Liddell).This movie won eight Oscars, with Attenborough, Briley, and Kingsley all earning honors.  No other film biography I ever have seen works so well.  It will stand the test of time and inform multiple generations.  One doubts remakes will be necessary."
"Good Morning, Vietnam",1987,7.3,"In 1965, an unorthodox and irreverent DJ named Adrian Cronauer begins to shake up things when he is assigned to the U.S. Armed Services radio station in Vietnam.","There never has been, and probably never will be, another film which shows both sides of Williams to such a great degree.As the wise-cracking disc-jockey, Williams shows his undisputed wild comedic talent, but the bomb scene and scenes of rural Vietnam life, truly allow Williams to such his dramatic acting ability. They look at the conflict, without getting in too deep.A superb cast as well including Bruno Kirby and the late great J.T. Walsh gives a solid backdrop, and are beautiful foils to Williams.Overall, a wonderful movie, add it to your collection."
Downsizing,2017,5.8,"A social satire in which a man realizes he would have a better life if he were to shrink himself to five inches tall, allowing him to live in wealth and splendor.","I don't really understand why it has such low ratings. And I was truly puzzled by that during the first half of the movie, as I thought the premise was original and interesting, the plot was engaging, and the actors were all great; I was loving it. But then it starts declining in quality and pace, and towards the end it feels like the story doesn't quite know what it wants to be or convey. That's a real shame because it could have been truly great from beginning to end. So it would be a bit difficult for me to recommend unless you're just a fan of any of the actors as they are giving they're best here."
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,2005,6.7,"Mere seconds before the Earth is to be demolished by an alien construction crew, journeyman Arthur Dent is swept off the planet by his friend Ford Prefect, a researcher penning a new edition of ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.""","Overall a tremendous success. It's very funny, very kooky and visually gorgeous. I saw it with about 2000 media persons and we all loved it, which is a pretty hard thing to accomplish.If you've never read the books (and I suggest you do, it moves at such a pace you might find yourself going 'eh?' a lot) then I don't know what you'd make of it. Think Monty Python in space, or a very British version of The Fifth Element.As an adaptation I think it works extremely well though there were a few confusing moments even for me as the large philosophical questions were crammed into two hours worth of movie. The new stuff is cleverly done and works a treat IMO.The cast: never been a fan of the office but Martin Freeman is perfect as Arthur Dent, Sam Rockwell hilariously OTT and Mos Def a surprising choice but one that really works. Trillian isn't that important in the novel and the movie bumps up her role to a love triangle situation between her Arthur and Zaphod. Again, Deschanel is an odd choice (another yank) but she is utterly spellbinding (oh the shower scene...hubba hubba).The FX are great, both CGI and the Jim Henson creatures (the Vogons, brilliantly voiced by The League of Gentleman). The opening title song is worth the price of admission alone (think Eric Idle at his peak).So I loved it, though the ending is also a bit of an anti-climax, but only perhaps because I was expecting something bigger. Still, it's p***-funny and that's the main thing.Best moment: Ford attacks the Vogons with a towel and foils them by closing a tiny garden gate (""Oh no! We'll have to go around!"")."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,2017,7.0,"Four teenagers are sucked into a magical video game, and the only way they can escape is to work together to finish the game.","Will admit to not expecting much. The advertising didn't have me completely sold, was worried as to whether it would be fun or turn into puerile immaturity and wasn't sure about the cast entirely. Saw it anyway being someone who wanted to see as many 2017 films as possible, who has seen their fair share and likes films intended to be escapist fun, who loves the Jumanji premise and who has fondness for the Robin Williams film.'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' turned to be much better and far more enjoyable than expected. It may not be a masterpiece or great, but it clearly strived to be glossy escapist fun and succeeded very well in that. Do prefer the earlier film but other than the title and the basic premise 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' to me seemed like its own take and should stand on its own.Can see definitely why it won't appeal, and hasn't appealed to (though on the most part have seen more positivity than negativity), some. Didn't care for the first twenty minutes or so in the real world. It didn't have an awful lot of momentum in a first act that was just setting things up and took too long to do so, was awkward at times in the writing and the acting was far more comfortable and interesting once we got to Jumanji.Most of the performances are fine once the film got going, but for me Nick Jonas was very bland and while more subdued than he usually is Kevin Hart for me sometimes grated (though at other points he is amusing), the rapid loudmouth shtick is going to be a very acquired taste.However, 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' was highly successful in its aim of being glossy fun escapism. The film is two hours but once we're in Jumanji they fly by. Although the story can be extremely predictable and the outcomes not surprising, the lively energy, the exciting thrills, thrilling action and suitably nail-biting but not intensely so sense of peril more than compensates.As do the witty script, that has the right dose of humour and surprising heart and even with the profanity from Hart it doesn't ever get too crude or puerile, and ace visual effects. Jumanji is colourfully rendered and mostly the film is nicely shot and more than capably directed. The music is rousing and pleasant to listen to and the ending is cosy and surprisingly poignant, which one doesn't expect yet it doesn't jar too much. There's even a nice Robin Williams/Alan Parrish tribute/homage touch, that is worth looking for if especially observant.Dwayne Johnson smoulders in intensity and charisma, in terms of acting style it is very familiar territory for Johnson but he does it well and that's all that matters. Karen Gillen more than holds her own with the other leads, with a good deal of sass and charm (her flirting/dance scene after being taught to do it is one of the film's highlights). Bobby Cannavale is suitably formidable villain, if somewhat underused. Absolutely agree with everybody who says that Jack Black steals the show, he has the funniest lines and moments (which are plenty) and it is perhaps his best performance since 'School of Rock'. The character interplay, which the film is heavy on, really sparkles.In conclusion, fun and surprisingly good film if not a great one. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
Dunkirk,2017,7.8,"Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Commonwealth and Empire, and France are surrounded by the German Army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II.","I guess I shouldn't be surprised how many people don't like this movie in an era of CGI, reboots, remakes, sequels, prequels, and generally easy to digest movies/tv shows. This is a real Christopher Nolan movie, not a Batman, but a real Christopher Nolan movie like Memento or Prestige. Watch it a few times. Pay attention to the details. Appreciate the sensory experience.Most of these bad reviews are because the person watched it once and was upset they weren't spoon fed every aspect of the characters and story. There is a ton of characterization and a great story but you have to pay attention."
Spaceballs,1987,7.1,A star-pilot for hire and his trusty sidekick must come to the rescue of a princess and save Planet Druidia from the clutches of the evil Spaceballs.,"There are some that say Mel Brooks's best satire is Spaceballs. Personally I like The Producers, but I'd never argue with anyone who holds out for this gut splitting comedy which uses both subtle satire and heavy bellylaughs drilled into the viewer with the skill and speed of one writing with light saber pen.The main object of the satire is the original Star Wars movie, but during the course of the film Brooks took a shot at The Wizard Of Oz, The Bridge On The River Kwai, Lawrence Of Arabia, Planet Of The Apes and Alien and a few others I could name if I thought about it. The man does know his film history.All is happy on the planet Druidia where King Dick Van Patten is eagerly awaiting the wedding of his daughter Princess Daphne Zuniga to her intended bridegroom, the eager Prince Valium played by Jim J. Bullock. But evil forces in the galaxy are afoot, the planet Spaceballs has a permanently polluted atmosphere and its President Skroob and his aides Colonel Sanders and Dark Helmet played respectively by Mel Brooks, George Wyner, and Rick Moranis have hatched a scheme to kidnap the princess and suck the atmosphere out of Druidia and take it back to Spaceballs.They look like they just might succeed, but a Han Solo like character Lonestar (Bill Pullman)and his faithful half man, half dog companion John Candy pull off a rescue, but they are hunted people now throughout the galaxy. All seems lost, but fate has directed them to a desert like planet where they meet up with Yoda who acquaints them with the most potent force in the universe, the all powerful Schwartz.The gags come so fast and furious that if you pop a kernel of popcorn in your mouth you could miss a gem. The performances are letter perfect and Brooks gives everyone in the cast his own bit or two. I forgot to mention Joan Rivers who is the voice of a C3PO character called Dot Matrix, companion to Zuniga the Druish princess complete with virgin alarm. And watch out if you mess with Zuniga's hair.If I had to name a favorite it would be Rick Moranis playing Dark Helmet. When the helmet is down it's a James Earl Jones like voice that emerges, deep and sinister. When the helmet comes up all you see is Rick Moranis and it looks like it wasn't just the kids that got shrunk.Spaceballs is a film that can be enjoyed by folks who love good comedy and for science fiction fans who don't take themselves too seriously. For someone like Mel Brooks to please both those crowds is really something."
Galaxy Quest,1999,7.4,"The alumni cast of a space opera television series have to play their roles as the real thing when an alien race needs their help. However, they also have to defend both Earth and the alien race from a reptilian warlord.","Reviewers say 'Galaxy Quest' is celebrated for its clever satire of sci-fi conventions and affectionate parody of fan culture. The film balances comedy, adventure, and heartfelt moments, exploring themes of transformation, innocence, and fandom. Performances by Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, and Alan Rickman are praised for humor and depth. Special effects, set design, and visuals are commended. Despite some criticisms of predictability and pacing, most find 'Galaxy Quest' enjoyable and memorable."
Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult,1994,6.5,Frank Drebin comes out of retirement to help Police Squad infiltrate a gang of terrorists planning to detonate a bomb at the Academy Awards.,"Reviewers say 'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult' offers Leslie Nielsen's signature deadpan humor and slapstick comedy, though many find it relies too much on recycled jokes. The parodies and star-studded climax are praised, but the change in director is noted to affect the tone. Despite mixed opinions, the film's self-awareness and cameos provide enough laughs, though it's often seen as the weakest in the trilogy."
Blade Runner 2049,2017,8.0,"Young Blade Runner K's discovery of a long-buried secret leads him to track down former Blade Runner Rick Deckard, who's been missing for thirty years.","Reviewers say 'Blade Runner 2049' is lauded for its visuals, world-building, and themes. Performances by Gosling and Ford, and Villeneuve's direction receive acclaim. Criticisms include slow pace, lack of originality, and plot issues. Some find it inferior to the original, while others see it as a successful expansion. Length and pacing are frequent drawbacks, though many appreciate its artistic ambition and thought-provoking nature."
Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment,1985,5.8,"Six Police Academy graduates are assigned to the 16th precinct, and their Captain desperately wants them to clean up the crime ridden neighborhood, but his second in command schemes to become captain himself by sabotaging the rookies.","Police Academy 2 (1985) was quickly rushed into production to capitalize upon the surprisingly successful first film. The recruits have finally graduated from the academy and are now assigned positions throughout the city. Crime is rampant and the people are afraid to leave their homes because of a local crime wave. A group of young punks (led by Bobcat Goldwait) have recently assaulted the chief of police (Howard Hesseman). With the city in turmoil and with his job being threatened by the Chief's right hand man, he turns to the new recruits to help clean up the city.I hate it when they franchise a movie and tone down the raunchy humor and crude manners, elements that made the first one a success. The movie is funny but it's not as good as the first film. Sadly the creativity and humor of the Police Academy films goes down the eventual slippery slope. By the fifth film the series becomes very unwatchable and extremely redundant. Even though it's a step down from the first film, it's still entertaining.Recommendx"
The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!,1988,7.6,Incompetent police Detective Frank Drebin must foil an attempt to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II.,"Reviewers say 'The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!' is a hilarious film with memorable lines and absurd situations that keep audiences entertained. Leslie Nielsen's deadpan delivery and the supporting cast's performances enhance the humor. However, some viewers find the rapid-fire jokes overwhelming, and a few gags fall flat. Despite this, the film's slapstick humor, visual gags, and iconic scenes, such as Frank Drebin's interactions with Queen Elizabeth, contribute to its enduring comedic appeal."
Police Academy,1984,6.7,"The mayor declares that anyone can enroll in the police academy irrespective of their physical condition or education level, and many misfits descend on the academy, including a young troublemaker who's forced to apply or go to jail.","I don't understand why this movie has such a low rating on IMDb (right now it's 6.1, that isn't so bad but this movie deserves more). It's a classic comedy which is still funny even after 20 years. It always elate me. Jokes are pretty simple and even innocent compared to nowadays movies but that's probably what's good about this film because it's funny to watch to whole family. You'll fall in love with a characters and this movie itself so much that every time you'll hear a theme of Police Academy it will make you smile. If you haven't watched it yet you definitely have to do it because they don't make this kind of movies anymore."
Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol,1987,5.0,The misfit Police Academy (1984) graduates now are assigned to train a group of civilian volunteers to fight crime once again plaguing the streets.,"That is the Citizens on Patrol (Program) ... which sounds a bit like what they were doing in part 3 ... but calling it something else. So Part 1, 3 and now 4 has giving people (viewers) new students and their ""adventures"" in making it through the ranks ... well actually just throwing them some bones to have something to laugh throughout the movie.Talking about this: the joke from movie number one with the podium .. it still gets ... referenced (milked) ... and why not? It is the most memorable of the jokes of the whole series. I feel a bit bad for the Proctor character ... he is the butt of many of the jokes and has to walk quite the fine line. Him and his boss ... well they do not have the easiest job, but they make it look easy. There is a feeling of decline ... and of course there is - because overall what new jokes are there to tell? You even get the family back that likes to hit each other (I suppose that is meant to be funny ... maybe it is for some I reckon) ... Anyway, let's not fret and while this has overstayed its welcome at least there are so many of the original cast leftover that you may not mind ... also you have appearances from Sharon Stone (clothed - a lot!) and David Spade as skater ... which is quite insane in and of itself ... but also a short cameo by none other than Tony Hawk himself. It kinda feels like the first appearance from either of those ... or at least one of the first ones they did, I might be wrong ... do we care? It's just fun to see them I guess."
Police Academy 5: Assignment: Miami Beach,1988,4.6,"The Police Academy's commandant will be honored at a police convention in Miami Beach. At the airport he picks a wrong bag with stolen diamonds. The ""owners"" want them back.","The first three police academies were very good silly comedy, they had some great moments were great underdog stories and made you laugh quite a bit, at least me, but by the previous one it just ran out of steam, there was nothing left in the whole Police Academy genre. This one finds a bunch more character combined with out old friends to go to Miami Beach for a convention. Was the worst of the original six. I would not recommend seeing it, although the next one wasn't all that bad.Steve Guttenberg being out of the series definitely made a difference and a lot of the gimmicks that made the original work were not present in this one. Part of the problem is that it went from being raucous adult comedy to a silly kid's comedy. None of the dirty humor is there anymore and that is sad. Stick with the first three those are very funny."
Police Academy 3: Back in Training,1986,5.4,"After it's announced that one of the two police academies in the state will be closed down, the alumni of Commandant Lassard's Police Academy (1984) return to the school to train new recruits and compete against the other academy.","While still suffering from the humor limitations of being rated PG, ""Police Academy 3"" has sight gags enough to make it worth watching a few times (at least more often than ""Part II"").The gang's all here and trying to train a new line of cadets in their own image (poor cadets) while Lassard (Gaynes) tends to his goldfish and tools about in his modified golf cart.Even Bobcat Goldthwait returns as Zed, this time training to be a force of good.  His scenes breathe a lot of life into this affair, as he screams at doors until they fall down, terrorizes his fellow cadets, hot wires police cars with his teeth and sings at the most inopportune times.Everyone else has at least one good scene, maybe two.  And considering how many are in the cast, that leaves room for a lot of good scenes.  Even Georgina Spelvin is back from the original and, bless her, she makes good, too (though not as hilarious as in the original).This is about as good as the sequels get, so look no further for laughs than ""Police Academy 3: Back in Training"".  Definitely Bubba Smith's finest hour.Seven stars.  Good job, officers."
Police Academy 6: City Under Siege,1989,4.4,Those bumbling cadets take to the streets when three inept goons successfully orchestrate a metropolitan crime wave.,"I am a big fan of Police Academy, so I put this to 4th of the line. In my opinion, it is better than 4 and 5. At least this movie has a subject to go with it, plus you get entertainment. I give it a 6, it doesn't deserve 4.5."
Police Academy: Mission to Moscow,1994,3.5,The Russian government hires the veterans of the Police Academy (1984) to help deal with the Mafia.,"What is it that's so resolutely unfunny about Mission to Moscow? Is it the lifeless direction? The disinterested performances? The lack of atmosphere? The joke-free script? It's all of these things, of course, but there's also something inexplicably poor about it that you just can't quite put your finger on.The regulars are the major weak point. While the guest cast have the misjudged enthusiasm to irksomely overact, all the usual culprits seem embarrassed by the whole thing. None of them sell their underwritten, reheated lines, and the fact that Bubba Smith and Marion Ramsey failed to sign up is a damning indictment. What comes through the screen, from George Gaynes to David Graf, is the sense of souls bleeding. ""Please get me a proper job, there must be a better way to pay my mortgage"" these actors scream with every fibre of their being. Leslie Easterbrook gets her usual single ""my character's got big breasts"" joke - why does she even bother to sign up for this crap? Michael Winslow looks old, tired, and frankly bored with the whole thing. Was his involvement only confirmed at the last minute? Because while he gives a curiously muted performance throughout, the script also fails to accommodate his talents in almost any way. Note that this is the ONLY Police Academy sequel in which he doesn't do his (admittedly run into the ground) ""Bruce Lee"" schtick.Police Academy managed to keep up the same level of quality between films three to six - they were all rubbish. But even by their low standards Mission to Moscow plumbs the depths, making Citizens on Patrol look like Annie Hall. New recruit Charlie Schlatter, there for the completely incongruous love interest theme, is never funny and the Russian characters are the crass stereotypes you'd expect. Any film that promises ""we're going to kick buttski"" is clearly dumber than is tolerable, and a tasteless reference to Chernobyl doesn't help matters.The only Police Academy film made outside the 80s, it was produced five years after the last one - why?!!?? Was there a big demand in the market for sh*te? Some cartoon sound effects (whistles, birdcall, etc.) are added to the action to try and pep things up, but this really is a DOA of a movie. True to form (or should that be formula?) it ends with an extended chase sequence that is neither suspenseful nor convincing.Just look at scenes like the one where G.W. Bailey gets hit in the face with stew. The stew is clearly missing his face and just lands on his chin, so Bailey (the only regular who tries) moves his face so that the full brunt of the stew will land on it. This dedication to duty is admirable, but also perfectly highlights the sloppy desperation of the whole thing.The series' move from the teen fodder of the first two, 15 certificate, movies had been subverted into the last five, PG cert entries. This is at its lowest ebb here; a comedy that seems wholly aimed at the under-5s and doesn't know what to do with its characters. Russian acrobats entertain the kiddies while its ... er... ""stars""... are left to stand around like second bananas, giving unfunny reaction shots.Maybe it's the ""fish out of water"" feel of it all, with the somewhat flat Russian espionage themes failing to ignite. But whatever it is, Mission to Moscow feels like a TV sitcom with the canned laughter track removed. In any other franchise this would be described as an ""unfortunate, sad end"" to the series. With Police Academy however, finishing with one of the unfunniest comedies of all time seems strangely apt. 2/10."
Tron,1982,6.7,A computer hacker is abducted into a digital world and forced to participate in gladiatorial games where his only chance of escape is with the help of a heroic security program.,"Reviewers say 'Tron' is celebrated for its pioneering CGI and visual effects, setting a new standard for sci-fi films. Its neon-lit digital world and action sequences are praised for their immersive quality. Themes of identity, freedom, and human-technology relationships are central, explored through program-creator interactions. Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner's performances are highlighted, along with Wendy Carlos's futuristic soundtrack. Despite criticisms of plot simplicity and pacing, 'Tron' is regarded as a cult classic and a significant cinematic milestone."
Police Academy: The Series,,4.9,"There is a brand new class of screw-ups at the Police Academy (1984). They face danger and try not to let their stupidity get in the way as they fight crime, often without even knowing it.",I miss this show a lot. It was very funny and much too short lived. It obviously got bashed a lot and was not as funny as the original movie series but then again that is always the case when you take a popular movie franchise then try to make a TV show based on it... TV shows never have the same budget and are usually missing all the big names stars and so on. This was funny though!
Murder on the Orient Express,2017,6.5,"When a murder occurs on the train on which he's travelling, celebrated detective Hercule Poirot is recruited to solve the case.","Difficult Kenneth Branagh makes, produces, and stars in good movies, and this version of Murder on the Orient Express features impressive sets, beautiful scenery, and lovely period clothes. An impressive case features Pen√©lope Cruz, Johnny Depp, Derek Jacobi, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, and Kennth Branagh as Hercule Poirot. I think those who are not familiar with Agatha Christie, Poirot, or the story may very well like this movie.I, on the other hand, was massively disappointed, especially by Branagh as a sort of English upper-class colonel with a stick-on cavalry moustache and by the needless addition of an introductory scene at the Wailing Wall. But I am prejudiced. I read the 1934 novel decades ago and again more recently. I liked the 1974 star-studded version with Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Jacqueline Bisset, Sean Connery, John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller, Anthony Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave, Richard Widmark, and Michael York‚Äîdespite the fact that Albert Finney was a very poor version of Christie's Hercule Poirot.In my opinion, the 2010 television version of the story starred David Suchet as the definitive Poirot, and the ending was far and away the best of all the versions with which I am familiar. So I think Christie fans may want to skip this edition of the classic."
Wonder,2017,7.9,"Based on the New York Times bestseller, this movie tells the incredibly inspiring and heartwarming story of August Pullman, a boy with facial differences who enters the fifth grade, attending a mainstream elementary school for the first time.","First of all, I gotta say that I read the book. I absolutely loved the book. Now, I wasn't going to raise my expectations for the movie adaptation because we all know how movies disappoint in comparison to the book. Wonder however, stays true to the book, which is its major redeeming point. I thought it would be some modified, really boring movie that would make me sigh throughout the whole 2 hours as I pointed out key flaws and differences between the movie and book (because I'm one of those people), but I loved it. The acting was INCREDIBLE, the story stayed true to the book (they only left out a flew plot points rather than invent their own) and it was overall a great experience. When I got out of the cinema, so many people were crying or said they had cried and I was overjoyed to find out that I wasn't the only person who felt touched. The child actors are fantastic, but overall there wasn't one bad actor. IF you were considering seeing this movie but weren't sure because you thought it might be boring, trust me, it's really worth the watch!!"
Black Panther,2018,7.3,"T'Challa, heir to the hidden but advanced kingdom of Wakanda, must step forward to lead his people into a new future and must confront a challenger from his country's past.","Reviewers say 'Black Panther' is lauded for its groundbreaking Black representation, stunning visuals, and immersive world. Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan deliver standout performances as T'Challa and Killmonger, respectively. The film explores themes of identity, power, and responsibility, receiving critical acclaim. However, some find the plot formulaic and characters one-dimensional. Criticisms include pacing issues, predictability, and over-reliance on CGI. A few argue the film's cultural impact overshadows its narrative and technical flaws."
Daddy's Home 2,2017,6.0,"Having finally gotten used to each other's existence, Brad and Dusty must now deal with their intrusive fathers during the holidays.","A depressingly nihilistic film that would have at least been commendable for its unabashed cruelty - that is, if an out-of-place clich√©d 'happy ending' hadn't been tacked on. As such, it only works as an exercise in awkward gags and uncomfortable dramatic beats, hammering the final nails into the coffin of three careers while it's at it. Now, if you're looking for a darkly comic view at a dysfunctional family, you'll find this for the first half of the film. If you want an upbeat, feel-good family comedy, keep your fingers in your ears and your eyes 'wide shut' until the final twenty minutes. If you want a good Christmas film, I suggest you go home and put The Polar Express back in the DVD player."
The Young Pope,,8.3,"The beginning of the pontificate of Lenny Belardo, alias Pius XIII, the first American Pope in history.","I was among many others who rushed to compare Paolo Sorrentino's Vatican drama The Young Pope to Beau Willimon's political masterpiece House of Cards after watching the first couple of episodes of the former. Obviously, I was wrong. Despite the unmistakable similarities between the enigmatic newly-elected young American pope Lenny Belardo, a.k.a. Pius XIII, and the evil mastermind statesman Frank Underwood, both shows aim at two completely distinctive targets, and although it is true that institutional religion and politics share so much in common in terms of manipulation and intrigue, Willimon and Belardo evidently play different tunes to approach such thorny issues.Once you get past the third episode, you will realize that Belardo is nothing like Underwood. He might be the most diabolical pope you would see on screen but his vulnerability brings the human back into his character and makes it contradictory, yet more believable. A mixture of kindness and cruelty, faith and doubt, innocent childhood and bitter adulthood, finely portrayed by Jude Law in a role that will later be marked in his career as the departure from Hollywood's 'pretty boy' branding and an ensuing history of fumbling and the beginning of more mature choices and performances.The entire series is based on this kind of alluring contradiction. I'm not Catholic, not even Christian, but I honestly cannot see how this show can be offensive to anyone. Sorrentino's take on religion and the system of belief in general is very far from liberal or conservative absolutism; he uses his renowned magical aestheticism to create a space for all voices to converse ‚Äì a space where religion and art collide in a supernova of beauty on every possible level. Unlike Willimon who wages a war against the political system to reveal its inherent ugliness, Sorrentino gently takes us to the heart of conservative dogma to show that religion is a personal story whose contradictory nature must be nurtured and celebrated. In the very first scene, our young pope, Lenny Belardo, struggles to crawl out of a heap of sleeping babies.It is a story about finding maturity in faith.The eccentric, brilliant mix of intellectual aestheticism and tongue-in-cheek comedy of The Young Pope is only made better by the almost perfect casting. Silvio Orlando particularly stands out as the football fanatic, Secretary of State Cardinal Voiello who even though represents the Pope's nemesis, is undoubtingly the most comic character in the series. Cheeky contradiction invades all aspects of Sorrentino's drama: narrative juxtaposition, cinematography, music¬Ö etc. Imagine listening to ""I'm Sexy and I Know It"" in the background of a sequence where the Vatican's most esteemed authority gets dressed for the Cardinals' address.Not to mention that Sorrentino's frames are a source of pleasure in their own right, I have truly enjoyed watching every minute of The Young Pope. Emotional, witty, beautiful, funny, original¬Ö the show has all elements I need to keep me anxiously waiting for a second season. Don't be long, Mr. Sorrentino!"
Chips,2017,6.0,An inexperienced rookie is teamed up with a hardened pro at the California Highway Patrol in Los Angeles; the newbie officer soon learns his partner is really an undercover Fed investigating a heist which may involve some crooked cops.,"I found ""Chips"" in the comedy section on Netflix, and not being familiar with it, I decided to give it a watch as I do enjoy comedies.I was familiar with some of the cast, so I had somewhat of a bit of notion of what to expect from the movie. And I will say that ""Chips"" rose to the occasion and really delivered top notch comedy entertainment. I was genuinely entertained throughout the course of the entire movie.""Chips"" was a good combination of comedy and action, as well as having a good character gallery, which really made the movie come to life. Especially so since it was characters that you instantly bonded with and took a liking to.I must admit that I am not overly keen on Dax Shepard usually, but he was really great in this movie and really carried his role quite well. But for me, then it was Michael Pe√±a who carried the movie with his hilarious performance, and he was so greatly cast for the role. But there were also lots of other good performances throughout the movie.There are many funny scenes in the movie, and they had me laughing heartily throughout the course of the movie. And the chemistry between Shepard and Pe√±a was just phenomenal, both as actors but also their on-screen characters.""Chips"" is a gem in the comedy genre, and one that definitely need more recognition because it is just through and through entertaining and funny."
Sorry to Bother You,2018,6.9,"In an alternate present-day version of Oakland, telemarketer Cassius Green discovers a magical key to professional success, propelling him into a universe of greed.","Wow, there are a lot of people who don't like this movie, and moreover, seem to mad that others like it. Some samples:""I think people who are giving it high praise believe that's just what their supposed to do but the fact is it's just a dumpster fire of a movie."""" I RARELY write movie reviews but had to inform people of the facts on this one.""""The positive reviews are from movie snobs who think they are smarter than everyone else and recognize brilliance in pure garbage.""You get the point. It's almost like we're all supposed to like all the same things now. (In fairness, there were plenty of other reviewers who didn't like it, but said they're glad others enjoyed it.I'm not a movie snob. I'm not a film executive and I have nothing to do with the film except I paid 6 bucks to see it last Tuesday. This is a very surreal satire. It won't be to everyone's liking, but it seems to me that we are getting more and more confused about the difference between fact and opinion. It's not a fact that this movie sucks, any more than it's a fact that this movie is great. These are classically opinions.Me, I like movies that start sort of pseudo-normal and go into bizarre. This is right up my alley. It's a Repo Man for our generation. Genetic engineering, dead end call center jobs, megalomaniacal Bay Area billionaires trying to save the world, race relations and post-postmodern art commentary. It's all painted in a crazy, bigger-than-life science fiction brush. Yeah, it's weird as hell, and maybe ends a little weakly (Monty Python and the Holy Grail, anyone?) but has a method in its madness.If you don't like absurdist humor, or if you don't like movies that are at least semi-overt political statements (especially if the political statement is opposed to yours. Anti-union, pro-business capitalists with short fuses be warned! You should give it a miss and just read the National Review's Ross Douthat's review. He saved you a lot of time worrying your beautiful mind about it.), and if you don't like a dollop of science fiction every now and then, yeah, you're going to probably hate it.But your opinion is still not fact. I liked it. That's my OPINION. Get over it."
La grande bellezza,2013,7.7,"Jep Gambardella has seduced his way through the lavish nightlife of Rome for decades, but after his 65th birthday and a shock from the past, Jep looks past the nightclubs and parties to find a timeless landscape of absurd, exquisite beauty.","Fifty years ago, Toni Servillo wrote a novel. It was praised, won an award, and he came to Rome and got caught up in the party set. He earns a living as an interviewer. Occasionally he is asked why he never wrote another novel, and he offers various, patently untrue reasons. Now his first love, whom he has not seen in more than forty years, has died. He turns thoughtful. He remains amused by the circus of the party set, but shreds their pretensions with a few well chosen words. He is obviously suffering a spiritual crisis, but when he tries to seek advice from a cardinal who is said to be next in line for the Papacy, the man walks away.The obvious move to compare this to is Fellini's 8¬Ω, but I see its roots in Samuel Pepys' dictum that ""when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life."" Servillo is not tired of life, but he is tired of this life, and sees death coming for him. He is perfect in the role.Writer-director Paolo Sorrentino fills the screen with beautifully shot images: the overblown spectacle of the party set trying to amuse themselves, and the quiet beauty of the old Rome, its bridges, the shores, the Colisseum across the street from Servillo's apartment, the remembered image of his first love. It's a rich, beautiful, thoughtful, wistful movie."
Elle,2016,7.1,A successful businesswoman gets caught up in a game of cat and mouse as she tracks down the unknown man who raped her.,"Paul Verhoeven has always worn the mantle of provocateur with pride, from the alluringly pulp ""Basic Instinct"" to the scandalous stripper saga that was ""Showgirls."" Even when he dips his toe in genre fare, there's still nevertheless an undercurrent of erotic satire in them (remember the tri-boobed woman in ""Total Recall""?). Even when Verhoeven plays it straight, like in the brilliant ""Black Book"", his films nevertheless drip with sensuality. His latest film, however, takes a more measured but by no means less lacerating tack.At first glance, ""Elle"" is so cold-blooded it could almost be mistaken for a Michael Haneke film, especially as it features Haneke's muse, the glacially poised Isabelle Huppert, at its center. Certainly, ""Elle"" kicks right off in a suitably brutal manner one would typically see from Haneke: namely, the savage rape of its primary character in her own home by a masked intruder. Shades of ""Funny Games"" certainly are evident here, but Verhoeven nevertheless keeps his own brand of reptilian energy alive in the film. Huppert's Mich√®le immediately gets back into her daily routine: overseeing the newest release from her video-game company, dealing with the drama of her son's upcoming fatherhood with a girl Mich√®le cannot stand, and seeing her mother tentatively flirting with a new marriage while her father, a convicted murderer, languishes in prison. With everything on Mich√®le's plate, a little sexual assault is merely seasoning.The shocking opening scene will certainly have audiences squirming, and indeed Verhoeven revisits it a couple of times throughout the film as Mich√®le mulls over the event, with variations here and there as she imagines how she could have defended herself‚Äîor provoked him further. And despite her desire to move on from the event, it continues to linger, especially as her assailant sends her threatening texts that he may not be done with her. But rather than go to the police, Mich√®le finds herself almost being an encouraging presence to her assailant, as though she craves the demeaning, degrading act to which she was subjected.It is certainly a problematic viewpoint for any film to have: that of a rape victim desiring to return to the act itself. But Verhoeven's lurid sensibility strangely doesn't hit the exploitative level that he typically sets out to achieve. While the story does juggle its fair share of melodramatic subplots (swapping out an affair for a cuckolding here while touching on a dark childhood there), it mostly focuses on playing up the stalker cat-and- mouse theme. Mich√®le goes the ""Brave One"" route at first: buying (and using) mace, going to a gun range. But as all of her life's little foibles start to coalesce all at once, it's almost as though she seeks the grim simplicity of simply being a ""victim.""I've always found Huppert to be a technically masterful but nevertheless somewhat clinical actress, one whose austerity can sometimes keep us at arm's length when she should instead be drawing us closer, deeper. I find that can be a bit of a detriment to some of her performances, but ""Elle"" relies on that puritanical presence, and her ascetic approach to her portrayal of Mich√®le is largely what makes the film work in the first place. She navigates the hectic labyrinth of her life like a ship cutting through thick fog, and even as Verhoeven puts his thumb on the tongue-in-cheek scales, she never once feels like she's in on the joke. Though Huppert was not Verhoeven's first choice (he shopped the script to the likes of Marion Cotillard and Carice van Houten beforehand), she nevertheless feels like the right one. Her flinty nature provides the dour center the film requires.""Elle"" does feel a bit bloated in his second half, and I honestly could've done with most of its tangential subplots being axed. Verhoeven's films generally outstay their welcome in terms of runtime, and Ellecomes dangerously close to that, but Huppert's compelling performance and Verhoeven's approach to the material will keep audiences in their seats, albeit forever squirming."
Take This Waltz,2011,6.5,A happily married woman falls for the artist who lives across the street.,"On my first viewing of Take This Waltz, after the film was over, I said in confidence and self assuredness to the people I went to see the film with, that I did not like it. However a strange thing happened. I saw the film and was unable to write my review of it until now and in that delay of time I started thinking of the film more and more and it seemed to resonate and stay with me and there were certain scenes and just whole issues, or ideals that were brought up during the film that I gave second thought to and reconsidered. Having written my review of Take This Waltz, immediately after watching it, I would have probably have given it a rating of 6 out of 10, but as I have thought and pondered over the characters and meaning of the film and just how it makes more sense to me now and in a sense has also grown on me, I now give the film my definitive rating of 8 out of 10. On first viewing there were some things I really liked about the film such as the interesting yet hauntingly beautiful colour contrast to the homes, interiors of the homes and even what the characters wore. It gave the film a distinct look and I admired it for that. I also appreciated that we could have a serious film about people in their 20's with no use whatsoever of cell phones, the internet, or any type of social media devices. It just felt more real having not used those things and avoided being too commercial as well. The one thing that I think really got me about the first viewing of the film was how I really did not like the main character Margot, played by Michelle Williams. I found it very irritating and awkward to the point of being irritating. She didn't seem to know how to act, or behave in certain situations and when she did speak, or try to live her dreams of fantasies it all just felt and looked terribly awkward and clumsy. Take for example her baby talk with her husband, Lou. It seemed so childish and really grated on my nerves. Also the fact that she was so indecisive about everything as well. Also on first viewing I felt that perhaps not all of the characters were as developed as they could have been and overall at the end of the film I think I got what director/writer Sarah Polley was trying to say, but at that point I was not interested anymore and I did not care either. Having thought about the film for a few days I came to realize that Michelle Williams' character Margot, is not as annoying, or irritating as she once seemed and even if she is a little bit, I could now understand why. I think the point was to show a character such as Margot, who is really indecisive about life and the choices that she makes and also shows how insecure and unhappy she is. I think Margot, was really stuck in a situation that became routine and comfortable for her, but she is a restless character always wondering if there is something new and better for her elsewhere. I think Margot's awkwardness as well as nervousness shows because of how insecure and uncomfortable with life and making decisions is hard for her. She wants to do what is right, but not destroy everything she has at the same time. It also lead me to think that I have known women like Margot, and they behaved in a similar such manner as she does in the film and for the exact same reasons that I mentioned above. It is not necessarily a character flaw, but perhaps just a weakness and a stumbling block that one needs to work on. The other characters later on seemed more well developed than on first glance and the film certainly does give a lot of food for thought. I literally spent days afterwards thinking about this film and some of the powerful and heartbreaking images in it. The film is a fairly depressing watch in a lot of ways, but I could respect that about the film because any film dealing with such subject matter, should be serious and take their character's feelings and emotions to heart and all that is here. The film does still have some flaws with it's pacing and there are times where it gets swept up in it's melancholy and it can tend to drag a little bit, but there is still enough rewarding things on display here to be worth a watch, even if you have to think about the film a couple days after you watch it, or even have repeat viewings. Brave viewers should give the film a chance and think about what it says about loneliness, relationships and the myths we sometimes promise ourselves, but ultimately lie to each other and ourselves about. An intelligent and deeply thought out film worthy of an 8 out of 10 rating and not just a 6."
Fist Fight,2017,5.6,"When one school teacher unwittingly causes another teacher's dismissal, he is challenged to an after-school fight.","As teacher, I saw this film as a sort of nice joke trying, in hard manner, to seduce its public. And doing a reasonable job. Sure, a lot of cliches and the reality of teacher work gives many good points. But it is not more than one of many easy commedies with familiar names and sketches of performances and script for a not too high form of entertainment. So, teacher, fight and few drops of sentimental scenes. Old recipe, decent product."
The IT Crowd,,8.5,"The comedic misadventures of Roy, Moss and their grifting supervisor Jen, a rag-tag team of IT support workers at a large corporation headed by a hotheaded yuppie.","Reviewers say 'The IT Crowd' is celebrated for its clever writing, quirky humor, and distinctive characters. The blend of tech-related jokes with broader comedic elements is frequently praised. The chemistry between Richard Ayoade, Chris O'Dowd, and Katherine Parkinson stands out. The satirical take on office culture and IT stereotypes is appreciated, though some note reliance on predictable tropes. The episodic structure and absurd comedy from mundane situations are lauded. Despite criticisms regarding character development and technical inaccuracies, the overall reception remains positive, offering a refreshing and enjoyable watch."
Lucky Number Slevin,2006,7.7,"A case of mistaken identity lands Slevin into the middle of a war being plotted by two of the city's rival crime bosses. Under constant surveillance by Detective Brikowski and assassin Goodkat, he must get them before they get him.","The subject says it all...This is a good, fast paced thriller... It would have been a really good thriller if it were not for the graphic scenes at the start of the movie, but once you get through that and a little bit of the confusion, this movie picks up very well...I don't want to mention any thing about the story, I think there is enough mentioned already at the plot summary and that's all you need to know.But trust me, do not believe people that say this is a bad movie... it is better than the many garbage movies that come out nowadays.. the acting and suspense is solid across the board. Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley are good, but the trump has to be Josh Harnett. He was good.Like I said, the only bad point of this movie are the graphic scenes at the start.. If you approach this movie looking for entertainment, you will enjoy it."
Mad Men,,8.7,"A drama about one of New York's most prestigious ad agencies at the beginning of the 1960s, focusing on one of the firm's most mysterious but extremely talented ad executives, Donald Draper.","Reviewers say 'Mad Men' is lauded for its deep character studies, historical accuracy, and nuanced depiction of the 1960s, focusing on the advertising industry. The show delves into themes of identity, power, and societal change, with standout performances, especially Jon Hamm as Don Draper. Its meticulous period detail receives high praise. However, some viewers critique the slow pacing, repetitive storylines, and occasional frustration with character exits and unresolved plotlines."
Boardwalk Empire,,8.6,An Atlantic City politician plays both sides of the law by conspiring with gangsters during the Prohibition era.,"Reviewers say 'Boardwalk Empire' is lauded for its high production values, historical accuracy, and Steve Buscemi's performance. The series features complex characters and intricate plots, exploring themes of power and corruption during Prohibition. Often compared to HBO's 'The Sopranos' and 'The Wire', it receives mixed feedback on emotional engagement and pacing. Its visual style, including costumes and set design, is highly praised. Despite some criticisms, it is considered a notable television drama."
Suburbicon,2017,5.8,"As a 1950s suburban community self-destructs, a home invasion has sinister consequences for one seemingly normal family.","I have a policy that I won't watch a movie unless it has an IMDB rating of 6 or more. With a 5.7 rating, I almost gave this movie a wide berth.That is, until I learned the Cohen brothers wrote this, George Clooney directed, and of course it's difficult to not enjoy any Matt Damon flick -,period.Near impossible to walk away from all that - no?I'm so glad I chose to ignore the 5.7 rating. Everything is teriffic, wonderful script, director doesn't dominate the direction and the kid is sublime. Stole the show,Matt Damon doesn't disappoint either.Was gonna give this a solid 8 but I'll change to 9 to nudge to 6+ where it deserves to be.WATCH IT - YOU WON'T REGRET !!"
Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel,2009,7.0,"While drinking at their local pub, three social outcasts attempt to navigate a time-travel conundrum.","This film is about three mates talking about time travel in a pub. They ended up doing some actual time travelling much to their surprise.Most time travel films do not make sense or have serious plot holes, but this plot is great. The story is creative, clever and well written. It keeps me interested and engaged throughout the film. The three mates are authentic and unpretentious, just like real characters we meet on a daily basis. This enhances the attraction of the film, making it even more engaging.Full length films under 80 minutes usually are bad, but ""Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel"" is a pleasant exception! I really enjoyed watching ""Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel"", and I would recommend it to my friends without hesitation."
Tron: Legacy,2010,6.8,The son of a computer programmer goes looking for his father and ends up inside the digital world that his father designed. He meets his father's corrupted creation and a unique ally who was born inside the digital world.,"Reviewers say 'Tron: Legacy' is celebrated for its breathtaking visuals, innovative special effects, and immersive 3D experience. The Daft Punk soundtrack enhances the film's atmosphere, receiving widespread acclaim. However, the plot is criticized for being predictable, shallow, and clich√©d. Characters are often seen as underdeveloped, and the narrative fails to match the visual grandeur. Disappointments arise from the original Tron character's portrayal and the father-son dynamic. Despite these issues, the film is appreciated for its nostalgic elements and universe expansion."
Veep,,8.4,Former Senator Selina Meyer finds that being Vice President of the United States is nothing like she hoped and everything that everyone ever warned her about.,A very smart comedy that I believe can only be understood if you have brains and some knowledge of the American political system. I don't know how people can rate this comedy to be worth 1 star . Probably the above conditions would missing
Geostorm,2017,5.4,"When the network of satellites designed to control the global climate starts to attack Earth, it's a race against the clock for its creator to uncover the real threat before a worldwide Geostorm wipes out everything and everyone.","This film tells the story of a network of satellites that controls weather. When the satellites fail, the world is in for apocalyptic weather that will end humanity.The trailer appears to tell people that ""Geostorm"" is a natural disaster thriller. The explosions in Hong Kong are breathtaking, and the tsunami in Dubai is very convincing that it looks real. Just the extreme weather scenes are quite impressive already, but what the trailer doesn't tell you is that there is a major conspiracy subplot in the film as well. The conspiracy keeps you guessing what is happening, and maintains a heightened level of suspense and thrill. The interaction of the two brothers is very good as well, as they go from being estranged to reaching resolution. It is very touching. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and it's an unexpectedly calendaring natural disaster and political thriller."
It Chapter One,2017,7.3,"In the summer of 1989, a group of bullied kids band together to destroy a shape-shifting monster, which disguises itself as a clown and preys on the children of Derry, their small Maine town.","It (2017) was a pretty good movie overall, most of it was entertaining and well made. I will say that it wasn't as good as I expected, there were parts that could have been better. Well first the positives. One of the positives is the acting, great performances were given by all, I was impressed by the child actors, clearly very talented. I think the child actors really committed and showed the level of talent that you'd usually see in an adult actor. The special effects were also very well done. Pennywise's look was well put together and all the wild effects with him looked good. The beginning sequence was very well done, I loved the exchange between Pennywise and Georgie. The middle part of the film was alright, it had good acting and it set up everything for the finale, but to be honest, the beginning and the end were great, very well done, and I felt like the middle portion was alright, but my mind wondered some and I just felt like there wasn't enough substance to the middle part of the movie. Yes, the characters were good and the acting was still good in the middle, but I feel like the story needed more support in that section. I haven't seen the original Tim Curry It miniseries yet, so I cannot compare the two, all I know is that the original is basically like two films in one. I am excited for an It 2, which I feel is on its way since the original had two parts to it. All in all, a 7/10. Overall enjoyable, and I was entertained by the end of it, even though there were places in the movie that could've been better."
Game Night,2018,6.9,A group of friends who meet regularly for game nights find themselves entangled in a real-life mystery when the shady brother of one of them is seemingly kidnapped by dangerous gangsters.,"This is not a movie I went in expecting to love, in all honesty it was just the next film showing. Imagine my surprise when I was treated to one of the best comedies I have see in quite a while. Bateman and McAdams are as likeable and charismatic as you would expect and the rest of the cast are pretty great too. It helps that this cast were given well written, interesting characters to work with. This film also boasts brilliant and creative camera work as well as very imaginative transitions that help to draw the viewer into the story and show that a lot of thought and effort was put into the making of this film. There are a small handful of jokes that don't land and a small number of logical errors but for the most part it is a very funny and entertaining thrill-ride, also stay during the beginning of the credits as they are very well done. Keep away from trailers for this film as they do give some things away that are better not to know going in, once this hits Netflix definitely check it out."
The House,2017,5.6,"After the town takes away their daughter's college scholarship, a couple start an illegal casino in their friend's house to make back the money.","I wanted to see this movie when it originally came out and put it to the side and saw the terrible review rating and didn't watch for over a year. I just watched it and it def wasn't terrible and I had quite a few laughs and would call it good movie. Not great, not mediocre but pretty good!"
Borg vs. McEnroe,2017,6.9,The story of the 1980 tennis rivalry between the placid Bj√∂rn Borg and the volatile John McEnroe.,"We are currently seeing a vogue for movies about famous sporting rivalries. I think this was kicked off by the excellent Senna (2010), which could have been a fact-of-the-matter biography of Senna but ended up (wisely) focusing on the rivalry between Senna and Prost, which brought an unintended emotional richness to the story. This was followed up by the almost-as-good Rush (2013) which goes back a decade to tell the story of dashing gentlemen racer James Hunt versus the cold, calculating Nikki Lauder. Now, a Swedish-led production effort is telling the story of one of the great tennis matches of all time: four-time champion Bjorn Borg versus the fiery tempered young John McEnroe at the Wimbledon men's final of 1980.As a strange pre-note: I watched Borg vs McEnroe in a completely empty theatre. Clearly, this movie is not getting the attention it deserves. I think it definitely affected my viewing experience; I was able to completely shut off and see it my own way. Which is good, as this film has a real psychological edge.In short, it was an excellent movie. Surprisingly so, in fact. It got to the point where I forgot I was watching a film and really seemed to be inside the heads of the two leads, right there with them, through every match, every up, every down, every argument, every triumph. This is quite the achievement for a film based in historical fact that can't take too many liberties with the story.Within the first couple of scenes, I could tell this was going to be my kind of movie: a real character study. We see a day in the life of global heart-throb mega-star Bjorn Borg, who is beginning to tire of the trappings of fame. I noticed the filmmaking technique of filming Borg in tight, claustrophobic interiors with shadowy men in suits hanging around in the background. It suggests that his life is beyond his control, is being lived for him, and maybe he wants out ... but doesn't know how to do that. All he knows is tennis, and winning.Enter the young and fiery John McEnroe, who is a major blip on Bjorn 'Ice'-Borg's radar. If Borg was the ABBA of tennis, McEnroe was the Sex Pistols. Known for ranting at umpires and crowds, he had whipped London's easily baited tabloid newspapers into a frenzy, they could smell blood in the water, and as McEnroe battled his way into the final with a combination of luck, talent and verve, a fairytale match (and perhaps a major upset) was being set up.Borg is unquestionably the main character of this film. I think we get about a 70:30 time share between the title characters. This is something of a shame, as I thought that McEnroe was perhaps the more interesting character. How does a New York wiseguy from a good family and lots of opportunities end up pushing himself into becoming a tennis world No. 1? The movie never really tries to answer this question. It focuses much more on Bjorg's backstory as a trouble kid who was recruited - some might say brainwashed - into channelling all his anger into his tennis. In perhaps the movie's best scene, McEnroe makes the link between them clear, and spots that Bjorg may seem like an iceberg but really he's a volcano waiting to go off.Shia LeBeouf was an inspired choice to play McEnroe. LeBeouf has always faced fierce criticism of his acting, his suitability for the kind of roles he wins, and has run the tabloid gamut lately with a string of bizarre stories about his life and behaviour. In scenes where McEnroe rants at the press, you feel LeBeouf is really getting something off his chest here. Also excellent is Stellan Skarsgard, who plays a tennis coach with just the right amount of highly questionable morality in pushing youngsters as hard as it takes to produce a champion.My one criticism of the film was the cheesy title cards, which spell out explicitly what's supposed to be happening in the movie with things like ""The rivalry would affect the players for the rest of their lives."" Show, don't tell, is the first rule of filmmaking. However, the movie's technical excellence - the tennis sequences were utterly spellbinding - and surprising emotional heft and depth make this a wholehearted ""Yes - see it"" recommendation from me."
The Greatest Showman,2017,7.5,Celebrates the birth of show business and tells of a visionary who rose from nothing to create a spectacle that became a worldwide sensation.,"As usual, the critics fail to grasp the obvious. Does the movie entertain? Yes, it does. Absolutely. Sure, it may not match the real story, and many things are not based in reality, but that's the point! It's a movie! It is a fun musical, very well done and enjoyable.If it was a made up story about John G. Pigglestack, then the critics would have nothing to complain about. I actually likes this much better than La La Land. Guess it's more upbeat. Musicals are a rare breed. Enjoy them while you can."
Water for Elephants,2011,6.9,"Jacob takes a job as an animal caretaker in a traveling circus. There he meets Marlena, a beautiful circus performer. Their shared compassion for a special elephant Rosie leads to love, but Marlena's cruel husband stands in their way.","I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Without being trite and redundant, it explores timeless and universal themes such as finding one's destiny and freedom, life choices, love, and jealousy, put in an interesting setting, that is the circus world -- the early 1900s when the US prohibition and depression were taking place -- which is nicely recreated on screen (by production designer Jack Fisk who's mostly known for his work with Terence Malick and David Lynch). Based on Sara Gruen's novel, this very original story is beautifully told, uses classical film-making techniques -- its camera moves, staging, lighting, pacing, usage of 'live' animals, stunts and special effects -- and well acted -- Robert Pattison comes across as a decent lead actor and not just a pretty face; Reese Witherspoon, very convincing as the star circus girl, doing some of her own stunts; however Christoph Waltz's performance stands out the most as he maintains the dynamic among all the main characters and fuels the drama. It's nice and refreshing to see a classically-made-and-looking film coming out of Hollywood."
Festen,1998,8.0,"At Helge's 60th birthday party, some unpleasant family truths are revealed.","Gee, if you think your family has skeletons in its closet or its gatherings are awkward, check out these guys. A wealthy Danish man is celebrated by friends and family at his manor for his 60th birthday, an event clouded by the recent suicide of one of his daughters. What starts off as light satire of the affluent, heightened by the home-movie-like realism that director Thomas Vinterberg got out of using handheld cameras, soon segues to much darker areas. It's a mesmerizing mix of comedy and pathos, and engaging throughout.I won't spoil it, but there is lots of incredibly bad behavior, some overt and stemming from how entitled these people are, and some complicit, protecting their insular world. Nothing shows just how much they are willing to sweep things under the rug than when some of the truths about the past come out, and one of the sons is aggressively taken out into the woods. Nothing shows just how bigoted the group is than when one of the other sons starts singing a racist song to antagonize a black guest (the man his sister is dating) and everyone happily joins in. The father saying the line ""that's all you were good for"" was like a knife to the heart, and the subtlety of the son's reaction (Ulrich Thomsen) is heartbreaking. The unique style of the film and moments like this make it memorable, and it's worth seeking out."
"Good Night, and Good Luck.",2005,7.4,Broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow looks to bring down Senator Joseph McCarthy.,"Rarely when an actor tries to direct does it work, and when it does you get ""character study"" without all the supporting scaffold a real filmmaker would provide.Clooney is a smart man who knows this. So he structures his projects in ways that are well serviced by what he has to give. The last one was an actor playing a character who created a character within. The structure of the thing was all focused on building and exploiting those ambiguities.Especially clever were the staging devices. Many were novel and a few were particularly striking.Now this is a more serious, but has the same values. It is after all a character study, and one that deals with these same two worlds. The man when off the camera, and the man on. Fabricated truth as an act by politicians. ""Journalism"" as way of piercing through those layers.Two evils, McCarthy and Paley. Clooney's point is that control over the pipeline is what matters in delivering the ""real."" So he works with some very studied staging. This movie has some of the best staging in recent memory. It must have taken forever to set the angles and lighting. Fortunately these are so powerful that no scene needs more than two setups. This is the way this cinematographer works for PT Andersen too.The switch in lighting from when Murrow is on the air to just after he goes off is rather thrilling: both are intense, in fact the on-air lighting is stark. But there is a powerful and visible shift from external to internal energy.If you just saw the script as words on a page, it would seem boring and preachy. It is the staging that makes this thing come alive, that gives a container for the great acting. The only actor who seems off is McCarthy, which is telling.I have the book Clooney's dad wrote about movies. Fortunately the son has better insights into what works and what doesn't, and has good intuitions about what to attempt.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
Maze Runner: The Death Cure,2018,6.3,"Young hero Thomas embarks on a mission to find a cure for a deadly disease known as ""The Flare"".","All you're gonna see in this movie is a continuous stream of cliches.
Sure, if it was released say, in 1970, when none of the superhero/sci-fi/fantasy that today is flooding the audiences was present, it would have been quite enjoyable and watchable.
But in today's market it brings nothing new. I could constantly guess what was going to happen at the end of certain action scenes, and don't even get me started about the helicopter scene... that one was supposed to be dramatic and some kind of fitting twist but just left me enraged at the stupidity of the screenwriters/adaptation.In the end it's quality is on par with the other 2 similar series (Divergent and Hunger Games), so, gets a 5 star ""meh"" out of me. Good for kids but intelligent people beware!"
Cidade de Deus,2002,8.6,"In the slums of Rio, two kids' paths diverge as one struggles to become a photographer and the other a kingpin.","Reviewers say 'City of God' is lauded for its gritty realism, powerful storytelling, and innovative cinematography, often drawing comparisons to 'Goodfellas' and 'Pulp Fiction'. The film is celebrated for its complex characters, compelling narrative, and raw depiction of Rio de Janeiro's favelas. However, some find the violence excessive and the script lacking depth. The use of non-professional actors and unflinching portrayal of poverty and crime are both praised and criticized. Pacing and length are also points of contention."
Peter Rabbit,2018,6.6,"A rabbit sneaks into a garden to steal food, and they get a new challenge with a new owner.","Peter Rabbit is one of my favorite kid's movie of the year so far. It's an adorable film that is perfect for the whole family. I love this film because of the acting and CGI.Peter Rabbit follows Peter Rabbit, Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton Tail and Benji as they get into mischief by taking vegetables from the garden next door. They take the vegetables from Mr. McGregor who tries desperately to get them out of their garden by using explosives and even an electric fence. The rabbits hang out with loveable characters like Bea. She helps the rabbits by giving them shelter when it rains and helps them get food.Throughout the movie, we see great acting from all the actors and voice actors in the film. I love how Domhnall Gleeson acts like a soulless man with the rabbits who he is trying to kill, but with Bea, he acts like in he's love. I found that Mr. McGregor (Domhnall Gleeson) really does seem to be in love with Bea. I also like how the voice actors portray the rabbits. Each one of them has a personality that is well portrayed in their voices and actions. For example, Cotton Tail is a memorable character because of how wild and reckless she is. The way Daisy Ridley voices her shows how wild she can be.The CGI in this film is extraordinary. The animals look so realistic. If you really focus on the rabbits, you can see the individual hairs on them. You can also see it on the pig character that hangs out with the rabbits. During a fight sequence with Peter and Mr. McGregor, they actually look like they are fighting and not like he is fighting a fake bunny.I rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to ages 7 to 12.Reviewed by Carla P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."
Father Figures,2017,5.5,"Upon learning that their mother has been lying to them for years about their allegedly deceased father, fraternal twin brothers hit the road to search for him.","Ready for another mainstream comedy that many critics seem to abhor but yours quite enjoyed, if only because of his undying affinity for its leads?Well, here it comes, Owen Wilson and Ed Helms offering their on-screen usual - a jovial freespirited guy vs. stuck-up and rigid but successful in life type - based on which they have managed to build quite long and successful screen careers, at least judging by the number of movies released.And on their journey together, they will meet, of course, a motley bunch of colorful characters played by Glenn Close, J.K. Simmons, Katt Williams, ex-NFL quarterback Terry Bradshaw, Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken et al.So far, so formulaic, I know. But guess what. Although the two leading men really do their usual schtick, and the approach is the usual too, ""Father Figure"" actually works.I may not be that big on sugarcoated finale, but this may be this one rare instance of unasked, unneeded mainstream comedy where critics are actually wrong and have underestimated the project just because how generic it looks on the face of it.You see, ""Father Figures"" may be a generic and mainstream by form factor, but there's something better beating at its heart.Looking bad, I can't call it inventive or LOL-filled, exactly, but at least the makers have hit the bullseye at what they were aiming for.Which means screwball comedy for the 2017's crowd: two chatty guys having an adventure together, meeting a bunch of interesting people on the way. Without an inner pressure to produce laughs but to involve the viewer in their lives.And most of the events and people did feel more interesting than usual in this (sub)genre because of the surprisingly character-based approach where most everybody gets room to breathe and introduce one's natural charm to the audience, which is a huge win for the movie as a whole.And the cast really has a huge amount of charm to spare, especially Bradshaw whose performance is so natural and enjoyable that I hardly believed this man is a retired sportsman who has only done a limited number of small movie roles.All in all, looks like everybody had fun and also believed in the material. I only did not care about the rather soulless section with Christopher Walken - but it's short and you can't always get everything, can you?By the way, this is the directing debut of one Lawrence Sher, a long-time comedy cinematographer who filled that job also in ""The Hangover"" trilogy (starring Ed Helms).I am afraid to check how many times I have used the words ""mainstream"", ""generic"" and ""the usual"" in this review - this doesn't bode well for the movie, surely - but it's actually not bad.Yes, there are many better comedies out there, but ""Father Figures"" may have just enough charm and heart to win you over for a 113 minute joyride."
Red Sparrow,2018,6.6,Prima ballerina Dominika Egorova turns dangerous Sparrow.,"I read a lot of negative reviews of this before I saw it, and although I was fascinated I was also dreading the horrifying torture scenes I'd heard about. But when I did see it myself I found it interesting, although I wish that it had been faster paced. I'd never seen a character quite like Dominika before. She was much more interesting than ""Salt"" and much more real than ""Atomic Blonde"". The characters were very memorable and believable and I am glad that I saw the film."
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,,7.4,"Set nearly a decade after the finale of the original series, this revival follows Lorelai, Rory and Emily Gilmore through four seasons of change.","Very forced, very ridiculous. Rory a whiner with no of the ambition she had throughout the series. She was getting there through the end of the original series and I was hopeful that with the original producers coming back it would be better but not the case. Please no second part....let it go."
Bad Times at the El Royale,2018,7.1,"1969. Four strangers check in at the El Royale Hotel. The hotel is deserted, staffed by a single desk clerk. Some of the new guests' reasons for being there are less than innocent and some are not who they appear to be.","It is a surprising , perfect puzzle. All is familiar. And you feel that more than you know. The build up is incredible, the mix of western, policier, horror and adventure, war and Tarantino, conspiracy theory, few drops of Scorsese and few crumbs of romance are almost incredible. A film admirable crafted. And that - from impecable story to the acting are ingredients defining it as real special."
The Only Living Boy in New York,2017,6.4,"Adrift in New York City, a recent college graduate's life is upended by his father's mistress.","Reviewers say 'The Only Living Boy in New York' delves into love, betrayal, and self-discovery in New York City. Jeff Bridges, Pierce Brosnan, and Kate Beckinsale deliver compelling performances. The cinematography and city portrayal are lauded. However, some find the plot and character development weak, with unconvincing relationships. Dialogue and pacing receive mixed reviews. It‚Äôs a character-driven drama with a strong cast, though its slow pace and complex narrative may not appeal to all."
Coyote Ugly,2000,5.8,"Aspiring songwriter Violet Sanford, after getting a job at a women-run NYC bar that teases its male patrons, comes out of her shell.","Reviewers say 'Coyote Ugly' targets teens with themes of ambition and self-discovery. Violet, an aspiring songwriter, moves to New York and works at Coyote Ugly bar. The predictable plot and clich√©s receive mixed reviews. Piper Perabo and John Goodman's performances are divisive. The soundtrack is praised, while bar scenes are seen as either entertaining or gratuitous. Overall, it's a light-hearted, feel-good film for its audience."
Ballers,,7.7,"A series centered around a group of football players and their families, friends and handlers.","I wanted to like the show right off the start. I dam into the show a little late but thanks to being able binge watching, I got catch up in no time. First couple of seasons were great. Just enough drama mixed with some real funny moments. During season 3, they mixed in some social justice issues. Played well, but you knew what was coming in season four. Full court press of Hollywood liberal BS. Season 5 is terrible. The time lines between seasons 1-3 are fine but between season 4-5 aren't explained. Season 5 is only 8 episodes long and they skimmed over some character issues, dived into areas than made no sense. Wrapped up some items forgot about others."
Professor Marston and the Wonder Women,2017,7.0,"The story of psychologist William Moulton Marston, and his polyamorous relationship with his wife and their mistress who would inspire his creation of the superheroine, Wonder Woman.","With some exception, Hollywood pretty much makes two distinct kinds of biopics. The first kind are the ones that almost seem obligatory ‚Äì your Gandhi's (1982), your Lincoln's (2012) and the upcoming Darkest Hour (2017); movies about historical giants who did truly incredible things with their lives, incredible things that should be projected (and even embellished) on the silver screen for the world to see. Then there are the ones about the others ‚Äì your oddballs, your misfits ‚Äì the characters that history books often ignore but are nevertheless important in the way our world is shaped.Professor Marston is certainly one of the latter folk. Outside of DC comic devotees and the odd discredited crime scene investigator swearing by the validity of the lie detector, William Moulton Marston is not a name people know. But believe me when I say that after watching this movie, you'll want to read up on him and his equally fascinating partners Elizabeth Marston and Olive Byrne. For not only is he the originator of Wonder Woman, the most famous female comic-book hero ever, he's quietly the most fascinating academics to steer the sexual proclivities of modern society since Albert Kinsey.He, Elizabeth and Olive I should say. The film starts with the three of them bouncing around the psychology department of Tuft University working on research and fine-tuning William's (Evans) latest invention. Olive (Heathcote), the Marston's graduate assistant becomes enamored with the two of them, binding the three in a love triangle that turns into a healthy polyamorous relationship. It being the puritanical state of Massachusetts in the 1920's however, the three couldn't be insulated by the academic bubble for too long before The Marstons are quickly forced out and move to New York City. From there, they hide their double lives with Olive assuming the role of homemaker and ""widow"" while William and Elizabeth (Hall) find work where they can as ""the couple"".As the narrative slowly ebbs towards the inevitable formation of the first Wonder Woman comic-book, the film occasionally diverts from its primary story and uses a red-baiting comic-book committee as connective tissue to William's complicated past. We've seen this kind of framing before. In fact, apart from the decade's long love story involving three people in a committed and loving relationship, we've seen all of this before¬Öwhich may be the point. Instead of treating the subject matter as salacious or radically divergent, it treats it as another day in dramatic romance-land. Even when the trio develops an interest in the virtually criminalized BDSM subculture, there's a normalcy there that could potentially bore the one couple in the movie theater looking for their unicorn.What makes Professor Marston ultimately work is director/writer Angela Robinson decision to make the tension largely external. It's never a question of whether all their goings-on will work but if the world will openly allow it. That concern is personified in Rebecca Hall's inner struggle that has the duel burden of her trying to be a smart, capable, 20th century working girl while also being madly in love with two people. One of whom is a woman.As the brash, irascible Elizabeth, actress Rebecca Hall is an absolute revelation. She bursts onto the screen, all but announces she's smarter than everyone else in the room and easily proves it with her wit and pragmatism. While Heathcote displays the mirage of idyllic feminine beauty, it is Elizabeth's radical feminism that makes the punchy title worth the watch. Seriously though, if Hall doesn't get an Oscar nom by years' end I may have to boycott (#hall&Oscars).Less successful is Luke Evans who, while certainly displaying the outward charm of a 1920's lad-about-town just has a knack for putting too fine a point on things. Every time we return to Connie Britton and her committee of comic-book hating cronies, Evans lectures like he's explaining particle physics to a freshman undergrad. Perhaps, given Marston's private life, Robinson may have figured the only way out of being questioned by a HUAC analog would be to be so soporific that they'd just move on to Superman or something.All in all, Professor Marston and the Wonder Women may not be reverential enough to induce comic-book fans to check it out. The film spans decades ultimately treating the creation of Wonder Woman as an afterthought. Yet for those looking for a decently paced, boiler-plate great biopic it may just be the right ticket for you. Additionally because it smuggles in a few liberalizing tidbits about love and modern feminism (Luke Evans's goofy grin notwithstanding), Professor Marston may even be worth a detour to a theater ballsy enough to play it."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,2018,6.1,"When the island's dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen and Claire mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event.","Reviewers say 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' offers impressive CGI and realistic dinosaur designs, with praise for Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard's performances and chemistry. However, the plot is criticized for being predictable and unoriginal, with clich√©d villains and pacing issues. The film's reliance on nostalgia and references to previous movies is seen as detracting from its own story. Despite these flaws, many find it entertaining for its action sequences and dinosaur spectacle."
Avengers: Infinity War,2018,8.4,The Avengers and their allies must be willing to sacrifice all in an attempt to defeat the powerful Thanos before his blitz of devastation and ruin puts an end to the universe.,"Reviewers say 'Avengers: Infinity War' is acclaimed for its grand scale, exhilarating action, and Josh Brolin's standout performance as Thanos. The film is celebrated for cohesively blending numerous Marvel characters, offering significant moments for each. Yet, it faces criticism for pacing, inconsistent character strengths, and over-reliance on shock value. Humor and storytelling effectiveness receive mixed feedback, with some viewers finding them engaging, while others feel they undermine the narrative."
Deadpool 2,2018,7.6,"Foul-mouthed mutant mercenary Wade Wilson (a.k.a. Deadpool) assembles a team of fellow mutant rogues to protect a young boy with abilities from the brutal, time-traveling cyborg Cable.","Reviewers say 'Deadpool 2' is lauded for its humor, action, and Ryan Reynolds' performance. The film's self-awareness and fourth-wall breaks are celebrated. New characters, like Josh Brolin's Cable, are welcomed, though some wish for deeper development. Emotional depth, especially regarding loss, is noted as an improvement. However, plot inconsistencies and familiar tropes are criticized. Special effects and CGI receive mixed feedback. Overall, 'Deadpool 2' is considered a fun, entertaining sequel that mostly meets expectations."
Mother!,2017,6.6,"A couple's relationship is tested when uninvited guests arrive at their home, disrupting their tranquil existence.","Mother! (2017)**** (out of 4)Usually this is where I put my plot description but it's best that you go into Darren Aronofsky's latest knowing as little as possible. Lets just say that Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem are living in a large house all alone when a surprise visit sets them off into madness.It really shocks me that Paramount would try to push MOTHER! onto the masses. For starters, the majority of moviegoers today do not want to think and they certainly don't want to see a movie where everything isn't explained. In fact, most people need everything explained in the trailer before they'll even go see a movie. A movie like MOTHER! is something that never explains itself and it constantly keeps you guessing from one scene to the next. What's it about? It's really hard to say as every viewer is going to come away with something different. With all of that said, it's easy to see why the film bombed at the box office and why those who did see it gave it a F rating.what I loved most about this movie is that the setting is just so perfect. You've got a large beautiful house out in the middle of nowhere and it's surrounded by beautiful grass and trees. From the very first scene we can just tell that something isn't quite right and Aronofsky puts us in this beautiful place with confusing surroundings. What makes the film so special is the fact that nothing is ever explained and with each new plot twist your brain just becomes more confused as to what's going on. We know something is happening and we know something bad is going to happen but you're constantly trying to guess what.Of course, a movie like this wouldn't work without a terrific cast to pull it off. Lawrence turns in another terrific performance and I thought she as fabulous at showing how fractured this character was. We're often questioning her mental state and I thought Lawrence managed to make you feel for the character and go along with her confusion to everything that is happening. Bardem actually steals the show with his fiery performance and I really loved the rage and anger he brought to the film as well as another side that I won't spoil to prevent giving away aspects of the plot. Both Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer were also terrific but, again, I'll hold off commenting more to prevent plot points.The cinematography is terrific and on a technical level the film is quite flawless. The story is a very interesting one and one that keeps you guessing throughout. The performances just seal the deal. With that said, the film certainly goes downright insane at times and the ending is just one that will have you staggering out of the theater. I must say that I thought the finale went on a bit too long and that it would have worked better had it been edited down a bit. Still, MOTHER! is a film that I really loved and one that I really respected but at the same time I'm not sure who I'd recommend it to."
Molly's Game,2017,7.4,"The true story of Molly Bloom, an Olympic-class skier who ran the world's most exclusive high-stakes poker game and became an FBI target.","There is a lot to like about 'Molly's Game' and the film gets a lot more right than it does wrong. I always enjoy films based on a true story, especially when they are as unique and interesting as this one. It's also always refreshing to see a biographical film without knowing anything about the story beforehand. I for one had never heard of Molly Bloom or her story, so it really made for fascinating viewing.The film runs very smoothly and despite the rather long running length, it never goes through any lulls and always feels fast-paced and on the move. 'Molly's Game' is not only an entertaining film but it's also informative and educational. The story is approached well, digging beyond the surface and ensuring no detail is missed from the story.'Molly's Game' is a strong biographical drama that does a very good job overall at telling a fascinating story."
The Disaster Artist,2017,7.3,"When aspiring actor Greg Sestero meets the weird and mysterious Tommy Wiseau in an acting class, they form a unique friendship and travel to Hollywood to make their dreams come true.","First up, I haven't seen the Room (2003), but of course have heard a lot about it through the years, a friend of mine is a huge fan who takes part in fan screenings and carries bunch of footballs into them...The Disaster Artist portrays Tommy Wiseau as a true enigma, which he no doubt is, he does things in his own ""a bit"" peculiar way. We also get to see a person with a big heart and a person in need for a true friend. There's some cheesiness towards the end of the film (not intentional, even if it's about making of the Room), but I enjoyed the movie a lot for it's heart and for the constant laughs it offers. James Franco is great as Tommy, it's so easy to ham this kind of an over the top transformation up, but that's not the case here. A really enjoyable flick.Rating: 8/10"
Brexit: The Uncivil War,,7.0,Political strategist Dominic Cummings leads a popular but controversial campaign to convince British voters to leave the European Union from 2015 up until the present day.,"I'm also an ad guy who's spent his share of time in offices beating up strategy on white boards, so I was sucked right in and saw a bit of myself. The lead character Dominic was like most of the folks in media industries that serve some great big unseen master. We put our noses to the grindstone, put our hearts on the paper for the elusive ""win"", yet we overlook the damage we potentially could be causing to the world. And what damage they have done. I found out things I hadn't known before, like the role of the Mercers being behind both big data companies, thus guaranteeing their influence on the referendum. And that is where I started to pull on my guts. That they had not only done it to England but had done it to America; manipulated politics, empowering an element of society that we should be leaving in the dark cellar of the 20th century. The fear of the other on an ever shrinking world controlled by ever more powerful and terrible titans is a regression. But the story is still being told and we will know the conclusion... maybe.
I highly recommend this film and leave one thought: In this ever more loud and volatile world, we must listen more than we talk."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,2018,7.0,"As Scott Lang balances being both a superhero and a father, Hope van Dyne and Dr. Hank Pym present an urgent new mission that finds the Ant-Man fighting alongside The Wasp to uncover secrets from their past.","Reviewers say 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' is lauded for its humor, character dynamics, and inventive action. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly shine, with their on-screen chemistry and the Quantum Realm's exploration receiving praise. The shrinking and growing tech is visually appealing. However, some critique underdeveloped female characters and flat storytelling. It‚Äôs a fun MCU addition, though not on the epic scale of other films."
Tomb Raider,2018,6.3,"Lara Croft, the fiercely independent daughter of a missing adventurer, must push herself beyond her limits when she discovers the island where her father, Lord Richard Croft disappeared.","Reviewers say 'Tomb Raider' offers a commendable performance by Alicia Vikander, praised for her strong portrayal and resemblance to Lara Croft. The film's action sequences and visual effects are lauded, aligning well with the rebooted game series. However, the script faces criticism for clunky dialogue and exposition, with some finding the story predictable. Pacing and character development receive mixed reviews, though many see it as an improvement over prior adaptations."
Wonder Wheel,2017,6.2,"On Coney Island in the 1950s, a lifeguard tells the story of a middle-aged carousel operator, his beleaguered wife and the visitor who turns their lives upside-down.","Reviewers say 'Wonder Wheel' receives mixed opinions. Cinematography by Vittorio Storaro and Kate Winslet's performance are praised. The 1950s setting and themes of desire and disillusionment stand out. However, dialogue is criticized as over-the-top, and characters feel unconvincing. Justin Timberlake's casting is often panned. Narrative structure and pacing elicit varied responses, with some appreciating the theatrical style and others finding it artificial. Overall, it's a flawed yet visually striking film with strong performances."
Atomic Blonde,2017,6.7,An undercover MI6 agent is sent to Berlin during the Cold War to investigate the murder of a fellow agent and recover a missing list of double agents.,"Atomic Blonde is the story of a British secret agent (Theron) who gets sent to East Germany around the time of the Berlin Wall removal. Her task - find the list of British agents that is apparently for sale and will endanger all of Britain's undercover agents.The storyline is a bit hard to follow, purposely, which is the biggest negative. You are unsure who is a good guy or bad guy or something in between, or both, or neither. The mystery is supposed to build intrigue but it also builds confusion too.It is clear that the Russians are the bad guys. James McAvoy delivers a great portrayal of the British agent on site who has the most info of anyone about the truth. But can he be trusted? Americans are involved, as well as the French. John Goodman also delivers as the CIA head, with Sofia Boutella (Star Trek Beyond) playing a sexy junior French agent.The acting is outstanding. McAvoy seems crazy. Goodman is secretive. Theron is inspecting and questioning everything as she tries to discover the truth.There is terrific use of colors and David Bowie music. The highlights are the fighting scenes that show just how tough Theron really is. Watch the Extra Features to learn all the training she put in to get in shape to kick butt. There is one long fight scene that spills into the stairway that will blow your mind.The ending is a pretty good twist, which you may or may not suspect, since there is such big confusion about agents' loyalties. The director also leaves open the door for a sequel which I believe Theron has signed on for.If you like a sexy, strong, somewhat violent spy movie, Atomic Blonde will blow you away. Enjoy!"
The Commuter,2018,6.3,An insurance salesman/ex-cop is caught up in a life-threatening conspiracy during his daily commute home.,"The movie started off good, showing the daily routine, introducing the characters and setting up the mystery. The editing was interesting and even a little artsy, yet it got me hooked. I really enjoyed the first 30 minutes.It was setting itself up to look like an intelligent mystery action. Having Neeson in this kind of movie spoils a lot, yet I thought this would be something different from his typical movies since he's getting older. I haven't seen the trailer though, just went to see the movie straight away.After everything is set up, it just turns into a totally divorced from reality generic conspiracy action. The premise was indeed as silly as it gets. The ending was as unsurprising as possible. Omnipresent supervillains who can plan and predict everything by the smallest detail, control the situation without even being close yet fail at the most obvious things. The plot just plays itself, at times Neeson is not even doing anything to change the situation, it just changes by itself to adapt to his needs. This is not a well written movie. The ending had me saying ""oh, no, you're not doing this...oh God"".Seeing Neeson perform ridiculous stunts was also a little confusing. No one should see an old man getting beaten like that. This just looks wrong.Overall, next time I'll want to see a cop/witness drama routine, I'd better go re-watch 16 Blocks. At least it had characters instead of comic book villains."
A Quiet Place,2018,7.5,A family struggles for survival in a world invaded by blind alien creatures with ultra-sensitive hearing.,"I rarely write a review, but when I saw the negative reviews claiming the positive reviews must be bots I felt it was time. Yes, there is a lot of sub-titling. The folks often had to be silent. How else are you going to convey what's going on? Do the complainers never see a foreign language film?Granted, we don't know why the creatures are there, but is that necessary for the story? I didn't walk away unsatisfied without that answer. It really didn't seem to be that important. This was a story about a family's struggle to survive in circumstances very few would make it through.The tension in this movie was incredible. I felt a kinship with the family I don't often feel. I see 30-40 movies a year. This was one of the best I've seen in a few months. I'll be going to see it again."
102 Dalmatians,2000,4.9,Cruella DeVil gets out of prison and goes after the puppies once more.,"unfortunately,this second live action film is a pale imitation of its predecessor.it's a lot slower,and the story feels contrived.it almost seems like filler to me.there are a few comic moments,though not as many as its predecessor.i think they should have left it at the first one,101 Dalmatians.Glenn Close returns as Cruella De Vil,and is good,but has much less to do this time around.plus,her two henchmen form th preventions film are not in this one,and they added some comic relief.Gerard Depardieu is in this one,in a completely ridiculous role,and he looks quite silly,to be polite.despite its problems its still watchable.my vote for 102 Dalmations is a 5/10"
Rebel in the Rye,2017,6.7,"The life of celebrated but reclusive author, J.D. Salinger, who gained worldwide fame with the publication of his novel, ""The Catcher in the Rye"".","Greetings again from the darkness. ""Holden Caulfield is dead."" So states Jerry's letter to his mentor. You likely know Jerry better as J.D. Salinger, and he wrote that while hospitalized with Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome after WWII. Of course, we know this proclamation is premature, as Holden Caulfield is the main character from Mr. Salinger's famous (and only) novel, ""The Catcher in the Rye"" ¬Ö a high school literature staple for decades.Imagine your dream is to become a great writer, but your own father continually reminds you that ""meat and cheese distribution has been good for this family."" Your restlessness often works against you, and though you are hesitant to admit it, a mentor for writing and life direction is desperately needed if you are to avoid the family business. Enter Columbia professor Whit Burnett (Kevin Spacey).This is Danny Strong's first feature film as a director, though you would surely recognize his face from his frequent acting appearances ‚Äì often as a weasly character. He is also the creator of TV's ""Empire"" and wrote the screenplays for THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY (Parts I and II) and LEE DANIELS' THE BUTLER. Strong does an admirable job in showing the commitment required to hone one's writing skills and proving ""the difference in wanting to be a writer and actually being one.""Jerome David Salinger is played well by Nicholas Hoult. His scenes with Spacey's professor are the film's best, and Hoult also shoulders the responsibility of Salinger's writing frustrations, personal life challenges, military service, and finally, his decision to become the most famous and long-lasting recluse (by comparison, Howard Hughes was an amateur).We learn that Burnett was instrumental in getting Salinger's first short story published, which finally gave Jerry the answer needed for a writer's most dreaded question, ""Have you been published?"" Quite a bit of time is devoted to his odd romantic relationship with Oona O'Neill (Eugene's daughter and the future, long-time wife to Charlie Chaplin). Zoey Deutch (daughter of Lea Thompson) plays Oona as an enigmatic lover attracted to Salinger's genius, but incapable of being patient for his career that might happen (and might not). She opts for the sure bet.Salinger's military service included Utah Beach on D-Day, and nearly as remarkably, his toting the tattered manuscript 'Catcher' pages throughout his tour. He returned home in 1946, and in 1951 ""The Catcher in the Rye"" was published. It's been referred to as the Great American novel and a rite of passage, while also being banned and derided for its whiny Holden.Director Strong emphasizes Salinger's turn to Zen Buddhism and his sessions with Swami Nikhilanda, as well as his evolving distrust of stalking fans and two-faced media. Support work is provided by Sarah Paulson as Salinger's salty agent, Lucy Boynton as his wife, Victor Garber as his father, and Hope Davis as his supportive mother. Just as in real life, we get nothing of Salinger's later years of solitude and isolation in New Hampshire, where he died at age 91.The book has sold more than 65 million copies, and continues to sell well today. In a shift from the recent documentary SALINGER by Shane Salerno, and the book ""J.D. Salinger: A Life Raised High"" by Kenneth Slawenski, this dramatization doesn't dig too deep, but it does allow a new generation to personify the legend. Perhaps it even paints a picture of a better/nicer man than what his real life actions showed. Regardless, the older Salinger certainly seemed to embrace the cause of ""write and get nothing in return""."
This Is Where I Leave You,2014,6.6,"After their father passes away, four grown siblings are forced to return to their childhood home and live under the same roof for a week, along with their over-sharing mother and an assortment of spouses, exes, and might-have-beens.","While many have claimed this title does not offer much that the others of this particular genre do, I have to disagree. This is a heartwarming story with genuine dialog between characters. Some of these conversations and interactions I have experienced firsthand. The cinematography captures the specific details that both add to the dialog and allow you to pick up more the second time around. The acting is very believable albeit a little over emphasized for comedy at times. The first time I saw this I had wished they rewrote a few of the lines, but after my second watch they seem fitting for the character and what they were going through at the time. I really did not like Phillip, and now I have come to realize he is that juvenile person frequently found in families. I approached this film without any prior knowledge of it and was pleasantly surprised. I concede it was not amazing, and given the cast list may spark high expectations for some, but going into any movie that way will leave you disappointed."
Snowpiercer,2013,7.1,"In a future where a failed climate change experiment has killed all life except for the survivors who boarded the Snowpiercer (a train that travels around the globe), a new class system emerges.","Reviewers say 'Snowpiercer' is a visually stunning, thought-provoking film tackling class struggle and social inequality in a post-apocalyptic setting. Praised for its unique premise, intense action, and strong performances by Chris Evans and Tilda Swinton, it captivates audiences. However, some critics note plot inconsistencies and surreal elements requiring suspension of disbelief. Others find the social commentary heavy-handed or the pacing and ending problematic. Despite these issues, 'Snowpiercer' is celebrated for its ambitious concept and compelling narrative."
Arthur,2011,5.7,A drunken playboy stands to lose a wealthy inheritance when he falls for a woman his family doesn't like.,"The original Arthur, was and is a great film. It was funny, well written and well acted. It garnered 4 Oscar nominations and 2 wins. It won 4 out of 5 Golden Globes. John Gielgud so deserved his award so well that year. Dudley Moore, in the title character, had the same lovable charm that Russel Brand has in this remake. But, there are several things missing which make the 2011 version an OK film, and not a part of cinema awards. First, its 2011 and not 1981. The original version would never be made today. Plain and simple. Arthur was a drunk. A hard drinker, who fell down, slurred words,and yes, even was driving drunk in several scenes. No way would that get approved today, or anyone think it was funny. It was this funny drunk that made Dudley's Arthur so much fun, even though today we would rush for interventions or rehab. Second, the director forgot this is a New York film. It is set in New York, but so much changed from one film to the other that the setting was indifferent here. No more neighborhood bars, dinners, landmark shopping sites, or eateries. There is one really good scene involving Grand Central, but it does not make up for the lack in the rest of the film. Linda becomes Naomi in the new film. She is not a New Yorker. Does not look like one, or act like one. She plays the part well, but its just not the same. Again, this remake could be set anywhere. Can you imagine the original anywhere but NY! Third, as good as Helen Mirrim is, she is not the Hobson that John Gielgud presented. She will not get any awards for this presentation. So, if you do not make any comparisons, you will like the film, but most likely not fall in love with it for 30 years. The film is well acted, written in parts, but it steals one lines too much from the original, that just seemed forced here or are not well placed. Whereas we see Arthur drink, he never really seems drunk. The relationship with Hobson is presented as a mother/son, rather than father/son. It was hard to believe in the relationship as much as the previous film. The chemistry between Arthur and Naomi was believable and flow very well throughout the film. Susan Johnson, played by Jennifer Garner had much more of a role here than the original. It needed to be reverted back. It was just not funny. Lastly, Nick Nolte was just plain horrible and nasty. He could have been written out completely. It made no sense for plot development. So, the new Arthur is as an OK remake, but not as good as it could have been."
Sidney Hall,2017,6.8,"Sidney Hall finds accidental success and unexpected love at an early age, then disappears without a trace.","I thought the first half was very slow and boring, but somehow still intriguing.The ending completely stunned me though and completely changed my opinion of this film."
Battle of the Sexes,2017,6.7,The true story of the 1973 tennis match between World number one Billie Jean King and ex-champ and serial hustler Bobby Riggs.,"There is no doubt that the event on which ""Battle of the Sexes"" is based on was a monumental moment in sports and cultural history. The exhibition tennis match between Bobby Riggs & Billie Jean King was in part a circus, but also (in large part) a key moment in the taking of women athletes seriously on the national stage. While this film eventually arrives at that point, I felt like it took far too long for it to ""get to the point"", so to speak.For a basic plot summary, this film tells the story of the run-up to the Battle of the Sexes match. Riggs (Steve Carell) is a male chauvinist through and through (or at least plays the role of one), while King (Emma Stone) is perhaps the premiere women's tennis player of her era. While King struggles with her confusing sexuality and Riggs falls on hard times with his own wife, this sets the wheels in motion for a match that will be more than just an exhibition, as it seemingly carries with it the weight of the Women's Liberation movement of the 1970s.Let me be clear about one thing: This isn't a ""bad"" movie by any stretch. Great acting performances are given, and the final 30 minutes are fully riveting. I completely understood and appreciated the message that was being conveyed.That being said, the entire film is predicated on the notion that the setup (e.g. the first 70-80 minutes or so) of both lead figures will lead to more dramatic payoff in the end. For me, that didn't happen (in fact, it actually had the opposite effect). I'm not sure that King's sexual leanings needed to be a focal point of the story, and in Riggs' case his relationship with his wife (played by Elisabeth Shue) should have been developed even more. Because neither of these things really get on track, at least the first half of the film felt slow and stodgy to me.Once the match is set and the buildup/execution of it begins, though, the film really shines. I only have video footage to go on here (I was not alive for the real thing), but Stone is sometimes a dead-ringer for King on the court. Carell's antics as Riggs were also accurate from what I have read/heard.So, while being a solid film, I cannot give ""Battle of the Sexes"" more than just above-average marks for the lackluster opening acts. I felt like a different lens was needed (or the execution of the chosen lens needed to be better) in order to make the movie truly riveting in the end instead of ""just"" somewhat inspirational. It never got to that ""next level"" for me (aside from the material about the actual match itself)."
Monsters University,2013,7.2,"A look at the relationship between Mike Wazowski and James P. ""Sully"" Sullivan during their days at Monsters University, when they weren't necessarily the best of friends.","The first Monsters Inc. came out when i was just 7 years old and immediately became one of my all time favourites from the day I saw it. With extremely high expectations in mind and excitement especially for Pixar's close attention to relevance (as I am actually at university now myself) I went to see the new one as soon as it came out.The film is a prequel following closely to our much loved earlier Characters, Mike and later Sully as they present to us their lives prior to the first movie. As well as an adorable new cast of monsters which are equally lovable as the old ones.To my delight, the film exceeded most if not all my earlier expectations. The plot is well written, funny and most of all extremely heart warming especially to long time fans like myself as well as those younger viewers that might not have even seen the first one.The nostalgic element of the film is perhaps the most well written. Every twist and turn reveals a huge or tiny explanation to the events and habits of the characters that I previously saw in the first film. Questions I never even asked myself, like why Randall's eyes are so squinty or how Sully and Randall's rivalry originated.Although i absolutely loved the movie, perhaps its because I've waited for 12 years but at some points it left me slightly unsatisfied and I'd have loved for some parts to be explained more thoroughly.Regardless of my only criticism, the movie made me laugh, cried with tears of joy, almost actually cried and was both heart warming and action packed. What more could you ask for? I urge those fans of the first film as well as anyone that just wants to have a good time at the cinema to see it. It'll be well worth your time!"
Green Book,2018,8.2,A working-class Italian-American bouncer becomes the driver for an African-American classical pianist on a tour of venues through the 1960s American South.,"Reviewers say 'Green Book' delves into racial prejudice, friendship, and growth through two men's journey. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali's performances are lauded, and the hopeful narrative is appreciated. However, the film is criticized for caricaturing characters, using clich√©s, and inauthentically depicting racial issues. Some argue it simplifies racial dynamics and perpetuates stereotypes. There is debate on whether it effectively addresses racism or offers a feel-good narrative. Despite mixed views on its theme handling, many value its message of unity and understanding."
Extras,,8.3,"Andy Millman is an actor with ambition and a script. Reduced to working as an extra with a useless agent, Andy's attempts to boost his career invariably end in failure and embarrassment.","Every so often, England hits the comedic mark and creates a benchmark to which all else must aspire; Monthy Python, Dad's Army, Fawlty Towers, Only Fools and Horses and, of course, the simply faultless ""The Office"". The writing team of Gervais and Merchant crafted in that series some of the most achingly funny and desperately well observed depictions of the human condition ever committed to film. ""The Office"" struck a particular chord with me because I have spent most of my adult life in sales and they nailed the highs and lows of that career brilliantly.Moving on then to their new offering; ""Extras"", I am happy to report that the observational skills have not deserted them. This time the central character (Andy Millman) is again played by Ricky Gervais, only, unlike his David Brent character, Millman is astute, caring and worth the time of day. Unforutnately, like Brent, he is also trapped in a spiral of underachievement.Andy Millman is an film extra, a background artiste, who aspires to a real acting role and the central theme of each episode is his quest for a ""line"" in each film in which he appears in the background. Along side him is his (seemingly) only friend, a frustrated thirty something woman, Maggie Jacobs (superbly played by Ashley Jensen), whose sole aim seems to be to find a husband / longterm partner. Add into this mix a chronically crap agent (Merchant himself), a nemesis in the shape of another extra who seems to be getting lines and a liberal sprinkling of cameoing ""A"" list guest stars and you have a wonderful platform on which to build a spankingly funny series.And wow... do they hit a home run! Every second of each episode is deliciously funny and acutely observed. Highlights to look out for are the Ben Stiller/Dodgeball opening weekend grosses scene - the Golly scene in Maggie's apartment - the ""Are you really a Catholic scene"" and, above anything you will have ever seen in a TV comedy, the entire Les Dennis episode.Les Dennis will be lost on Americans but for those of us who have followed his plunging career, you can only weep for this superbly written and judged performance. Pathos doesn't even begin to cover it.Also, anyone who can look at Kate Winslet again without thinking of that ""phone sex"" scene is a better man than me.Please, please, watch ""Extras"". It may, for some, be an acquired taste but once you have that taste, its like a piece of Swiss chocolate - exquisite.And no laugh track either - yay England."
A Happening of Monumental Proportions,2017,4.9,"During the course of one day, students at a Los Angeles school become caught up in a plot of sex, lies, and dead bodies.","One look at the cast and it's just amazing that all these people agreed to do this monumentally stupid film. They must have REALLY been hurting for work during the pandemic? Dunno. I RARELY write reviews but this one was such a waste of time, waste of talent, waste, waste, waste..."
Brad's Status,2017,6.5,A father takes his son to tour colleges on the East Coast and meets up with an old friend who makes him feel inferior about his life's choices.,"Reviewers say 'Brad's Status' delves into mid-life crisis, status anxiety, and happiness pursuit. Ben Stiller's portrayal of Brad, a man envious of his successful friends, is lauded for depth and relatability. The film is celebrated for insightful dialogue and character-driven narrative, though some critique its slow pacing and predictable plot. Critics value its examination of societal pressures and the contrast between material success and personal fulfillment. The father-son relationship and self-acceptance journey are key emotional elements. Overall, 'Brad's Status' is viewed as a thoughtful, albeit uneven, exploration of life's complexities and perspective importance."
12 Strong,2018,6.5,"12 Strong tells the story of the first Special Forces team deployed to Afghanistan after 9/11; under the leadership of a new captain, the team must work with an Afghan warlord to take down the Taliban.","The 12 Special Forces (SF) men who went into Afghanistan were accompanied by USAF Combat Controllers (CCT) who were the actual men calling in the decisive air strikes. For some reason they were excluded, though they were right there, on the horses, riding with their Army brethren. To leave them out turns this story into more of a fictional portrayal of what really occurred. The courage that the SF troops showed was indeed worthy of telling in this format, but it is remiss in not telling the whole story and recognizing all the men on the ground. I enjoyed the movie but couldn't get past the parts where the SF troops were calling in air strikes. I give it 6 stars for the action though.On a side note, the CCT personnel accompanying the A teams are highly trained in many facets of special operations, and complete a 2 year training program, which includes required graduation from Military Freefall and Combat Diver, among numerous other courses. These men also earned the right to be recognized for their contributions in breaking the back of the Taliban."
Saving Mr. Banks,2013,7.5,"P. L. Travers, a London author who is financially broke, visits Los Angeles to meet Walt Disney, who is keen to adapt her Mary Poppins books for the cinema. However, his methods do not meet her approval.","""Saving Mr. Banks"" is an exquisite film. It draws you in with the delightful reality of Disney as well as the triumphantly stark reality (inasmuch as it is reality; I do lack her background) of Mrs. Travers. I purposely leave out parts of the film for the sake of the movie-goer, but let me say how delightful the songs are, the people are, the displays of emotion-- my part as well, as I nearly cried and fully laughed at certain points throughout. The film speaks to me and it feels complete in its currency-- tuppence, if you will-- in taking Mrs. Travers' story and embellishing it with the truth of the creators' (both Travers and Disney, for the part he has in the creation of the film) lives. The lives of the characters-- and I do mean most people seen on screen, in particular the driver and Mrs. Travers' mother-- are well-told and well-lived, and spark a certain comfort and warmth, even in the cold of their realities and harsher backstories. I believe the film has done its job beautifully, and I wouldn't change it for the world. Even the animated penguins, although for me there is still my deep and abiding love for their real counterparts."
Lady Bird,2017,7.4,"A fiercely independent teenager tries to make her own way in the world while wanting to get out of her hometown of Sacramento, California, and to get away from her complicated mother and recently-unemployed father.","In the year 2002, Catholic high school senior Christine McPherson, self-named ""Lady Bird,"" is an impetuous girl literally from the wrong side of the tracks who's at a critical stage in her life: she's continually at odds with her mother, despises her mundane life in Sacramento, and wants to go to college on the east coast in a city with culture. Her ordinary life suddenly takes a turn when she has to deal with popularity, discovering boys and romance, and coping with the problems of people other than her own. Cute, quirky, and thoughtful coming-of-age story is one everyone can relate to, with the all-important themes of teen angst, adolescence, and ambition; colorful dialogue, well-drawn characters, and believable situations are only elevated by a talented cast of actors. Twenty-three-year-old Ronan perfectly embodies the spirit of a self-absorbed teenager in all her complexities, making it easy for viewers to recall a similar time period in their lives. ***"
Call Me by Your Name,2017,7.8,"In the summer of 1983, 17-year-old Elio is spending the days with his family at their villa in Lombardy, Italy. He soon meets 24-year-old Oliver, an intern working for Elio's father. They discover the heady beauty of awakening desire.","Saw 'Call Me By Your Name' as someone trying to see as many films from 2017 as possible, because same sex love has been portrayed beautifully more than once and because it was one of the best received films of the year with a lot of award attention as we speak.A distinction more than well deserved. 'Call Me By Your Name' is certainly one of my favourites of a pretty hit and miss 2017 (with some great films, bad films and films in between and near but not quite both extremes) and, like another gay love-themed film from 2017 'God's Own Country', one of the films of the year that really touched me. It is much more than just a ""gay movie"" and shouldn't be dismissed as just that, that on the most part it hasn't is a good thing.'Call Me By Your Name' is most striking for its emotional impact. The erotic elements are tasteful and sensual, but it's the relationships that are even more beautifully done. The subject matter is handled with subtlety and surprising wit and the central relationship is tender and compassionate with a little tension. Just as, even more, impressive is the father and son relationship, which was sincere and touching, again with just as much burning intensity, and boasted the film's most powerful scene. The joy and pain of love and desire is portrayed in a way that really touched my soul and comes over as surprisingly relatable.The acting is another big strength, advantaged by that the characters are interesting and not stereotypical with conflicts that are genuine and not predictable. Timothee Chalamet is especially remarkable and has a great future ahead of him if he continues in this direction. Armie Hammer is hardly inferior in perhaps his best performance to date, a very sympathetic performance which helps make the central relationship as powerful as it is. Michael Stuhlbarg also should be highlighted, a very wise and sincere performance and he has never been this poignant.Luca Guadagnino directs beautifully, bringing the best out of his actors and the gorgeous scenery just as gorgeously shot. The sincerity, wisdom, compassion and wit of the source material is ideally captured in the script and as indicated the film looks great. The music has whimsy and understatement which suits the story perfectly, and while the pace is Merchant/Ivory-influenced-like deliberate it never felt dull to me due to being swept up in the emotion and being riveted by the writing and performances.In conclusion, a beautiful film with much more to it than what it can easily be dismissed as. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
How to Talk to Girls at Parties,2017,5.7,An alien touring the galaxy breaks away from her group and meets two young inhabitants of the most dangerous place in the universe: the London borough of Croydon.,"It's pretentious and cheesy, unique and amazing. The only promise I can make is that you have never seen anything like it. That in itself should be enough to make any movie or art lover feel like this movie was money and time well spent. Of course there are flaws, but it's punk, that's what gives it character. If you spend all your money on Hollywood reboots, stay far, far away...You can enjoy the humor in this movie on the surface level or try to dig deeper into the many metaphors. I just went along for the ride and had a great time."
Death Proof,2007,7.0,"Two separate sets of voluptuous women are stalked at different times by a scarred stuntman who uses his ""death proof"" cars to execute his murderous plans.","It all started as an homage to old exploitation cinema and double feature screenings. It was meant to be one of the most shamelessly entertaining films of the year. Sadly, after flopping in the US, Grindhouse has been chopped in two, with Quentin Tarantino's segment, Death Proof, being the first to be released on its own after competing at the Cannes Film Festival. It is not presented in its Grindhouse version, which included scratches, dirt, missing reels and other visual aging techniques; instead, we get the full cut, containing additional information regarding certain plot points and a few ""juicy"" bits that were left out first time around (a hot lap dance being the best new scene). And while it certainly would be fun to see the entire double-bill in all its glory (hopefully it will get a worldwide DVD release), I must say I really enjoyed QT's half as a separate picture.As this is intended to be Tarantino's answer to '60s and '70s B-movies, the plot of Death Proof is extremely simple: there is a psychopath, named Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), who enjoys killing women with his car, a virtually indestructible vehicle (""This car is 100% death proof. Only to get the benefit of it, honey, you REALLY need to be sitting in my seat!""). Whenever he arrives in a new town he selects a group of girls and sets his perverse plan into motion. And unless he runs into someone who is as crazy or drives as well as him, there is no way to stop him.Those expecting QT's usual stream of film references will be disappointed: apart from a hilarious restaurant scene that sort of spoofs the opening of Reservoir Dogs and a couple of nods to similarly themed horror flicks (and, of course, the casting of Russell, which is a deliberate homage to John Carpenter), the director is not interested in exposing his absolute knowledge of this kind of cinema. This time, he delivers a straightforward genre movie, albeit with his trademark tough women at the center. The trailer promised a wildly fun B-movie, and that's exactly what Death Proof is: a movie like they don't make anymore, old-fashioned, irony-free and exciting as hell.However, this does not mean Tarantino has set his visual or verbal obsessions aside: the dialogue is as imaginative and surreal as it has always been, and there are enough shots of bare female feet to keep fans happy. Naturally, being this a QT flick, those feet belong to a quality cast: the only real star in the film (apart from the villain, that is) is Rosario Dawson, but she is part of a talented ensemble, which includes Vanessa Ferlito (CSI: NY), Rose McGowan (Scream) and stunt-woman Zoe Bell (who doubled for Uma Thurman in Kill Bill). The mention of honor, though, goes to Russell, who finally has the opportunity to go all bad again, and boy, does he go bad: even when he is pretending to be a friendly chap who offers you a ride home, he exudes a sense of menace that doesn't leave until the end of the picture. Also worth praise are Michael Parks, reprising his role of foul-mouthed sheriff Earl McGraw (of From Dusk till Dawn and Kill Bill fame) and tying the two halves of the film together, and Tarantino himself, popping up as smug, ridiculously likable bartender Warren. The latter is particularly charming because, unlike other times (From Dusk's Richie Gekko is a good example), QT does not try to prove he can act (although he pulled off a remarkable job in Alias). He's just there for the sheer fun, like everyone else.Pure, unadulterated fun and excitement: that's the key to appreciating Death Proof. Do not expect a smart, unusual take on an overused genre, like the director has done in the past: this time around, he sticks to the rules, delivering a loud, silly, sexy, violent piece of Entertainment with a capital ""e"". It may not be the best film of 2007, but it sure as hell is one of the most purely enjoyable."
The Wizard of Lies,,6.8,"The fall of Bernie Madoff, whose Ponzi scheme robbed $65 billion from unsuspecting victims; the largest fraud in U.S. history.",The Wizard of Lies is an excellent Bio film and depiction of real life events. Never is the viewer lost in financial jargon as the film goes to great lengths to accurately explain the crimes Bernie Madoff committed on the American Public at large and his investors. My only problem besides the long run time of this film is that it has no choice but to paint Madoff as a sympathetic character which is much more than he deserves. A victim of his own greed the fact that he was able to defraud and scheme on his own is amazing and terrifying at the same time. It makes the viewer question our countries financial structure and institutions. If one man can alone do so much damage to an already struggling stagnant economy how could this happen? Even worst still how many like him go unrecognized? Excellent acting and dramatic conflict is presented in the wizard of lies. A film that is as educational as it is entertaining.
Sicario: Day of the Soldado,2018,7.1,"The drug war on the U.S.-Mexico border has escalated as the cartels have begun trafficking terrorists across the US border. To fight the war, federal agent Matt Graver re-teams with the mercurial Alejandro.","The first Sicario film was a surprise to me, and I enjoyed it for its slick thrills but also its darkness and twists and turns; like many I looked forward to the sequel - or rather, the next film, since this isn't really a sequel so much as a film with the same characters. The film places the characters into an unofficial war with the cartels where US forces try to engineer wars between the cartels to make them weaken and distract each other. This action is started due to terrorists being brought into the US as part of human smuggling run by the cartels - which gives the film an opening few minutes that matches the first film for impact.From this very topical and heated place, the film actually plays out a fairly pedestrian plot that gets progressively smaller after a certain point. It delivers quite a few solid and slick sequences along the way, and mostly the impact of these carries the film. It isn't as good as it appears though, and the plotting doesn't really build - and it is disrupted by some very lazy writing where convenience keeps things going, no matter how unlikely it is. Such things do hurt the film, and took me out of the immersion I felt in the first film; in particular the ending I thought was pretty weak as a conclusion to this film, albeit opening it for the third film that we all knew was in the works before this one was even released.The cast add to the sense of quality, and the performances are suitably tough and committed. The production standards are high, and it is easy to see the money and effort up there. It is just a shame that at its core, the writing is not as tough and engaging as everything else would have you believe. Still a solidly tense affair that is too slick to not be worth a look, but not as good as it seems."

The Dilemma,2011,5.3,A man discovers that his best friend's wife is having an affair.,"OK..OK..it wasn't 'awful', but it wasn't OH MY GAWD this is great either. The Dilemma is presented as a conflict that Vince Vaughn has when he sees his best friend and business partner's wife having an affair. Coulda , shoulda, woulda been a different movie had the following happened: 1. Winonna Ryder...isn't in the movie 2. Kevin James ..had more comedy rather than 'engineering' skills 3. Winonna and Kevin were 2 different actors that were the married couple in this flick AND, 4. they stuck to the storyline and stopped adding countless subplots that have no impact on the movie or the comedy or the acting.This movie had a lot of potential, it just didn't produce it.Vince and Jennifer were acceptable as an unwed committed couple but there wasn't enough balance between comedy and drama. I went into this expecting comedy and got more drama. It just wasn't Vince's best work, nor was it Ron's.Even the 'other man' (who's name escapes me) was just too far fetched to wrap my mind around in character. He was over he top. If he was like the guy from the Richard Gere, Dianne Lane movie, then it'd be more believable.I'm just not sure what I watched tonight. Vince had his typically banter and rhetoric in some scenes, but the movie was just too heavy and too over the top with story lines for me to count...or to recommend.I also didn't like Queen L in this...she overacted her scenes and her character just didn't seem to fit in enough to make it worth her paycheck. This is the same actress that got the Oscar nod for Chicago...completely overacting in this movie.I'd definitely wait for the DVD..as a rental. You will only want to see it once.."
Falling in Love,1984,6.5,"Although they live married lives, two strangers keep running into each other, starting a friendship that could blossom into so much more.","I came across this film by accident one night. I'd never heard of it but it starred Meryl Streep and Robert De Niro, so I stuck it on. A more modern take on Brief Encounter, this film sings because of the chemistry between its leads and it quickly became clear to me that it'd be a film I'd revisit.Sometimes you've just got to go with a film for what it is - Falling in Love won't change your life and it doesn't push any cinematic boundaries, but it's a classic love story that brought together two of the best actors of its time. It's now one of my (not so) guilty pleasures."
Bride Wars,2009,5.5,Two best friends become rivals when their weddings end up scheduled on the same day.,"This is not a bad film, but it falls far short of its potential, given its two talented stars (Anne Hathaway as Emma, and Kate Hudson as Liv) who portray best friends who grow up sharing a dream of the perfect wedding.When it comes time for their big days, a wedding planner makes a scheduling mistake, and they find themselves adversaries. Though they still love each other, their desire to realize their dreams overpowers their affection. What follows is a battle of ""tit for tat"".The story is rather formulaic. And there are no surprises. And opportunities were missed that might have resulted in more entertainment. For example, in one scene, Anne Hathaway dances, but Kate Hudson just sits and watches her, despite the fact that Hudson can dance and it would have made more sense if the Liv character had done just that.Also, since Hudson and Hathaway are both accomplished singers, one can imagine a scene that would involve singing, say a karaoke competition."
Valentine's Day,2010,5.8,Intertwining couples and singles in Los Angeles break-up and make-up based on the pressures and expectations of Valentine's Day.,"On the Valentine's Day in Los Angeles, the lives of several dwellers are entwined and affected somehow by love. The florist and owner of the Siena Bouquet Reed Bennett (Ashton Kutcher) proposes his insecure girlfriend Morley Clarkson (Jessica Alba) that says yes to him. His best friend Julia Fitzpatrick (Jennifer Garner) is in love with Dr. Harrison Copeland (Patrick Dempsey), but she does not know that he is married and celebrating his fifteenth wedding anniversary with his wife Pamela Copeland (Katherine LaNasa). The bitter TV sports reporter Kelvin Moore (Jamie Foxx) is assigned by his boss to cover stories of people in love in LA. The phone sex entertainer Liz (Anne Hathaway) hides her profession from her boyfriend Jason (Topher Grace). The grandson of the couple Edgar (Hector Elizondo) and Estelle (Shirley MacLaine), Edison (Bryce Robinson), has a secret unrequited love at school while his grandparents are facing a crisis in their marriage. The executive Holden Wilson (Bradley Cooper) befriends Captain Kate Hazeltine (Julia Roberts) that is eleven months away from home in the fourteen-hour flight back to LA. The contract of the veteran quarterback Sean Jackson (Eric Dane) is not renewed by his team and he schedules an interview to the press with his neurotic publisher Kara Monahan (Jessica Biel) that hates Valentine's Day. The teenagers Alex (Carter Jenkins) and Grace (Emma Roberts) are planning to have sex for the first time. The cheerleader Felicia (Taylor Swift) is in deep love with her boyfriend, the athlete Willy (Taylor Lautner). In the end of the day, revelations will fortify or end loves.""Valentine's Day"" is a sweet movie of director Gary Marshall with a constellation of stars in the cast. The concise screenplay succeeds in developing characters and entwined stories along 125 minutes running time. There are some excellent lines, with jokes (Taylor Lautner telling that he feels uncomfortable taking his shirt off in public is hilarious) and surprises (the revelation of Holden and Kate loves are among the best). I was surprised with the bad reviews in IMDb. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Idas e Vindas do Amor"" (""Comings and Goings of the Love"")"
Open Season,1995,5.3,"When the television ratings machines suddenly malfunction, public television suddenly, but mistakenly, soars to #1 in this humorous satire.","Robert Wuhl writes, directs and stars in this limp satire of the television industry. Wuhl works for the major television ratings company, but when he is denied a promotion, he jumps ship to work for Helen Shaver, the manager of a public television network. Wuhl is not particularly good at his job, but a malfunction in the ratings boxes makes it look like he is when public television seems to be coming up as the top rated network. This causes chaos at the former number one network, a sleazy, pandering operation programmed by Rod Taylor. All of the targets for satire here are super obvious, and none of it transcends the most superficial level. The owner of a network thinks winning makes his dick bigger. Ha ha ha ... hilarious. This is an okay waste of an hour and a half, but it's never really better than mildly amusing."
The Shipping News,2001,6.7,An emotionally beaten man with his young daughter moves to his ancestral home in Newfoundland to reclaim his life.,"Having read the brilliant and seamless novel - and believing that movie adaptations of novels rarely succeed - I did not expect to like this movie. Much to my surprise, I found the film totally successful. Kevin Spacey - who seemed to be an odd choice for the role - is perfect as Coyle, capturing the true spirit of the character and proving himself to be one of the finest movie actors of his generation. Judi Dench is, as always, just right. Julianne Moore (I was not previously familiar with her work) is astonishing. The look of the movie...the tone...the screenplay all work - as an adaptation of the novel and as a film unto itself. I do not understand why this movie did not garner more recognition. I strongly recommend it to those who have read the novel and those who have yet to experience Annie Proulx remarkable prose."
Solo: A Star Wars Story,2018,6.9,"During an adventure in the criminal underworld, Han Solo meets his future co-pilot Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian years before joining the Rebel Alliance.","Reviewers say 'Solo: A Star Wars Story' elicits mixed reactions, praising Alden Ehrenreich and Donald Glover's performances and the film's adventurous spirit. Many appreciate the expanded universe and Han Solo's backstory. However, some criticize the lack of depth, inconsistent tone, and pacing issues. The visual style and certain plot elements receive negative feedback. Despite flaws, many find it an enjoyable addition to the franchise."
Ferdinand,2017,6.7,"After Ferdinand, a bull with a big heart, is mistaken for a dangerous beast, he is captured and torn from his home. Determined to return to his family, he rallies a misfit team on the ultimate adventure.","It seems that some people think the jokes in this movie fall flat and there is too much unnecessary clutter, but I honestly really really loved this movie. It was a reluctant choice after not finding anything else playing that we wanted to see, but man am I glad we saw it!Ferdinand is the cutest bull I've ever seen, and I have to say I'm not familiar with this studio's other films but I thought the animation style was wonderful. I especially liked the wide range of expressions on Ferdinand's face throughout the movie, with a few close-ups that really captured the perfection of those expressions well.The story itself was inspirational and heartwarming, full of examples and discussions on being yourself and breaking the mold and not letting anyone else define who you are. There were some heavy-handed moments that I'm not sure a younger viewer would understand, or possibly that may be too bleak for a very young viewer. Some of the humor was a little more adult-oriented, but most of it was clean, although sometimes rather stupid. The ending is pretty much exactly what you'd expect of a feel-good kid's movie, and I liked it very much."
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,2018,6.5,"Gellert Grindelwald plans to raise an army of wizards to rule over non-magical beings. In response, Newt Scamander's former professor, Albus Dumbledore, seeks his help to stop him.","Reviewers say 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' offers a darker tone and expanded world-building with mixed reception. Praised for performances by Eddie Redmayne, Johnny Depp, and Jude Law, and impressive visual effects, the film struggles with a convoluted plot and numerous subplots. Critics argue it lacks focus, serving more as a setup for future installments. Disappointment arises from the limited role of fantastic beasts and an underdeveloped villain. Despite these issues, some appreciate its deeper exploration of the wizarding world and ties to the Harry Potter series."
Leaving Neverland,,7.0,"At the height of his stardom, the world's biggest pop star, Michael Jackson, began long-running relationships with two young boys, aged between seven and ten, along their families. They now allege that he sexually abused them.","It's interesting how people are trying so hard to find an excuse for MJ. They just don't want to beleive anything bad. Imagine if your next door neigbour was walking around holding hands with boys (every time with a different one), and you know that these boys spend nights in his apartment. You know that their parents are not there all the time. Wouldn't you be calling police? And if that neigbour was telling you that what he does that because he loves children and he didn't have a childhood, wouldn't you recommend him to see a psychiatrist?
But in case of MJ it all makes sence. All that is pefectly normal. I don't get it! Wake up, people!!!"
What Happened to Monday,2017,6.8,"In a world where families are limited to one child due to overpopulation, a set of identical septuplets must avoid being put to a long sleep by the government and dangerous infighting while investigating the disappearance of one of their own.","This film tells the story of a future world, where only one child is allowed door to overpopulation. Seven sisters hide in secret until they are discovered by the authorities.Science fiction is usually not my favorite genre, but ""What Happened to Monday"" blew me away. The plot is original and it's excellent. A life of hiding and living only one day a week is pretty unimaginable, but the sisters managed it. As horror falls, the story gets really thrilling and completely draws me in. I long to see how things end up and what happens to the sisters. The title can be interpreted in two ways, and I think it is very clever. I think this film will be a classic, and it certainly ranks very high up in my list alongside with ""Gattaca""."
RocknRolla,2008,7.2,"When a Russian mobster orchestrates a crooked land deal, millions of dollars are up for grabs, drawing in the entire London underworld into a feeding frenzy at a time when the old criminal regime is losing turf to a wealthy foreign mob.","This is a typical Guy Ritchie film. With a wide range of characters and some very powerful performances to random shots making you wonder where the story is headed but just in time to converge in one final showdown leaving you with just word.. WOW!! I can't help but compare it to SNATCH..as they are similar in so many ways...but SNATCH was much more intense, funny and a better script.Some very fine performances from Gerard Butler from 300, Tom Wilkinson from Michael Clayton but what really surprised me was outstanding performance by Toby Kebbell. His subtle dialogue and crazy laughter really spells horror and magic at the same time. The story takes you through the world of mafia and spins all dramatic sequences with blood, deceit and loads of humor. The scene where Gerard and his gang escape from the two Russian militants... that scene made me laugh like crazy.I just loved this movie and i can't wait to see the sequel."
Measure of a Man,2018,6.4,A bullied adolescent experiences a turning point summer in which he learns to stand up for himself.,"Really good and light movie, i was crying at one moment. You can watch this with family when you will stay together on a cold or rainy evening at home.8 stars of 10."
Babe: Pig in the City,1998,5.9,"Babe, fresh from his victory in the sheepherding contest, returns to Farmer Hoggett's farm, but after Farmer Hoggett is injured and unable to work, Babe has to go to the big city to save the farm.","The wildest thing about Babe: Pig in the City isn't that it's directed by George Miller, it's that it's recognisably a George Miller film. The narration, chaptered structure and overall insanity are thoroughly his plus there's a lot here that either comes from his Mad Max Saga or would end up in it afterwards. This may look family friendly but it goes to some dark places.Elizabeth Daily nails the endless optimism of Babe, a character who always does the right thing no matter what and her voice acting matches that straight away. Everyone else does a good job of voicing their on screen animals opposed to any signs of stunt casting, making it one of the least uncanny versions of this mostly bygone trend.George Miller's direction powers through any and all flaws on sheer weirdness alone. The world building is really fascinating as the titular city is a real smorgasbord of recognisable landmarks and iconography from across the globe which keeps the whole thing interesting, even when some set pieces start to overstay their welcome."
Rio,2011,6.9,"When Blu, a domesticated macaw from small-town Minnesota, meets the fiercely independent Jewel, he takes off on an adventure to Rio de Janeiro with the bird of his dreams.","Rating: *** out of 4.I usually don't like movies like RIO, mainly because they always end up being rehashes of previous movies; unless your talking Pixar, there's very little to no new things in animated movies nowadays other than their exquisite looks. So when I saw a special advanced screening of RIO a few days ago, my expectations were low, enough for me to expect that the film will fail. But hey, what a surprise! It's pretty good actually. So RIO ain't a new masterpiece-it's not at all much different with any Dreamworks or Blue Sky Animation effort that comes out every given year- but it was fun. The kids at the screening had a ball with it, but I can also hear older teenagers and adult audiences chuckling along with them. And I'm up there with them.The story isn't something you haven't heard before. Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg) is a rare Blue Macaw raised in Minnesota by the bookish Linda (voiced by Leslie Mann). But being the last male of his species, Blu is requested to leave his Minnesota homeland and shipped to his real birthplace, in Rio de Janeiro, where a female of the same species is being kept in captivity. Blu doesn't warm up easily to the impetuous Jewel (voiced by Anne Hathaway), and certainly a rare bird such as her being kept in captivity like that doesn't help. It also doesn't help that Jewel wants to escape and Blu, being a total ""housebird"" and all, can't fly.But what it lacks in a fresh new idea it more than makes up for in lively execution. This movie is just amazing to look at, boasting one of the most gorgeous looks of any animated movie since some of the Pixar films and the occasionally bizarre but lavish-looking BEE MOVIE. It may even be more beautiful since this is exactly what it wants to be and not much else. Director Carlos Saldanha, who helmed two ICE AGE sequels, and the rest of the crew have done just that. The eye-popping visuals are the moneymaker and one of the few films to come out once and a while that is worth paying extra money to see on 3D. Once again, the 3D ain't something groundbreaking, but it's exactly what comes to mind when thinking of 3D; the visuals are pristine and dynamic, with flying scenes that are just breathtaking to watch. I could almost feel the wind as a glider glides past the Christ the Redeemer statue. Rio itself looks gorgeous, from the ""Carnival"" parades to the look of it during the nighttime scenes are just beautiful. If nothing else, it's a virtual tour of a beautiful portrait painted by Saldanha and his animators. The voice cast ain't bad either. Eisenberg is hilarious, and granted he'll be doing these kind of work sometime soon. The real standout is Jemaine Clement (from FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS), who lends an irresistible bad guy charm as a cockatoo named Nigel. Hathaway, George Lopez, will.I.am and Jamie Foxx all fulfill their roles perfectly.RIO ain't much new, but at least I enjoyed it for what it is. And I wouldn't mind going back to it during its official release and wallow in the dazzling scenery again. Here's a movie meant to be done (and seen) on 3D."
Hotel Transylvania 3: A Monster Vacation,2018,6.3,"Count Dracula and company participate in a cruise for sea-loving monsters, unaware that their boat is being commandeered by the monster-hating Van Helsing family.","When the lonely Count Dracula goes on vacation with Mavis, his family and monster friends on the cruise ship Legacy, he immediately falls in love with the human Captain Ericka. However the mysterious woman has a secret that may jeopardize Dracula, his family and the other monsters. Who is Captain Ericka?""Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation"" is another funny animation of this successful franchise. This time with a predictable romance between Dracula and a woman. In-between, lots of confusions and funny situations with the monsters. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Hotel Transilv√¢nia 3: F√©rias Monstruosas!"" (""Hotel Transylvania 3: Monstrous Vacation"")"
Out of Sight,1998,7.0,"A career bank robber breaks out of jail, and shares a moment of mutual attraction with a U.S. Marshal he has kidnapped.","Ah, 1998¬Ö Bill Clinton was still in the White House, the Gulf War had no sequel, gas was under $2.00 a gallon, and a kinda-known actress was in her pre-J. Lo/Jenny from the Block/Bennifer/media whore phase.Back when she used to have a little (now she has a lot), Jennifer Lopez was actually enjoyable in Steven Soderbergh's 'Out of Sight.' I saw this in the theater when it came out and remember thinking it was one of the better films I'd seen that year. I watched it again last night on DVD, and I have to say that it still holds up. Clooney is finally given a worthy vehicle, and he and Lopez have actual, undeniable chemistry on the screen. The supporting players (especially the incomparable Don Cheadle) are perfectly cast. Soderbergh effortlessly knocks this one out of the park.One critic gave the film two and a half out of four stars and claimed 'Out of Sight' was in need of a 'shot of adrenaline,' but I have no idea where he's coming from. When you think of all the bad movies that are released in any given year, you'd think you'd appreciate something like this."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,2018,7.7,"A group of terrorists plans to detonate three plutonium cores for a simultaneous nuclear attack on different cities. Ethan Hunt, along with his IMF team, sets out to stop the carnage.","Reviewers say 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout' delivers thrilling action, impressive stunts, and a dedicated performance by Tom Cruise. The film is celebrated for its high-octane scenes but criticized for a convoluted plot and predictable twists. Some find it relies on familiar tropes and lacks originality, with underutilized characters. Despite these issues, it is seen as a solid, exciting entry in the franchise."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,2010,6.9,The young owl Soren is kidnapped by the evil owls of St. Aegolious who want to turn him into a soldier. He escapes with some of his friends and warns the mythical guardians about the evil plan.,"Legend of the Guardians is director Zack Snyder's first attempt at a completely CGI and children's film while his other credits are all hard ""R"" films. So does the king of slow-mo succeed?The quick answer is yes. Guardian's is a film that takes the liberties 3D and photo realistic CGI have to offer, like Avatar, to make a world and characters larger (or smaller) than life to let your mind be soothed into something beautiful, mystical, and most importantly, entertaining.The story takes the classic yet reliable fable of good versus evil. To put it simply, an army of Evil owls who have obvious horrid intentions of ruling the Owl Kingdom must be stopped against all odds. The only creatures powerful and wise enough to defeat the army are the legendary Guardians of Gahoole.The film follows main owlet Soran, voiced heroically by Jim Sturgess. Soran is kidnapped by the army of the Evil Owls. After being exposed to the armies wrong doings, Soran knows the only hope in defeating the baddies are to warn the Guardians. From there, the film takes flight into an epic adventure of action, companionship, and beauty.Guardians is a rare treat in computer animated cinema. While Pixar is always reliable, Guardians is a very different film that strives to be an epic while appealing to a mass audience and succeeds in doing so. From the fantastic action scenes, to the articulate directing, spectacular animation, smart 3D, and top notch voice acting, Guardians is a film that will leave you mesmerized days after it's viewing."
Entourage,,8.4,"Film star, Vince Chase, navigates the vapid terrain of Los Angeles with a close circle of friends and his trusty agent.","You know it's a good show when you watch it for the second time and you like it more than you did before. Can you imagine a show with all the great modern actors? Well there you have it.
I must say that these guys have simply just rocked this show and they have portrayed their characters as if it was all real. Not to mention Ari Gold's character who you may fall in love with starting episode 1. This show was and still is a masterpiece!
p.s: I will watch it again in a few years. I cannot wait."
Entourage,2015,6.5,"Movie star Vincent Chase, together with his boys Eric, Turtle, and Johnny, are back - and back in business with super agent-turned-studio head Ari Gold on a risky project that will serve as Vince's directorial debut.",This movie is not up to par on the series. I wasn't blown away after watching but not disappointed either. Still it was nice to see the boys back on the screen and thought the ending was a good fit.
Super Troopers 2,2018,6.0,"When a border dispute arises between the U.S. and Canada, the Super Troopers are tasked with establishing a Highway Patrol station in the disputed area.","I went and saw this as a double feature with the original. Hadnt watched the original in years but it was fun to see again. The second one is just like the first. Bad plot, funny movie. I laughed harder than I have in the theater in a long time. The comedy is at times, brilliant, stupid, uncomfortable, memberberry, but it is pretty constant throughout with making you laugh. My stomach still hurts a bit. Anyone who is bashing this movie in a review....I dont know what they expected, but this one is worth a watch. If you liked the first one, you should like this one."
"Paul, Apostle of Christ",2018,6.6,"Luke risks his life to visit Paul, who is captive in a Roman prison under Nero's rule. Together, they struggle against a determined emperor and the frailties of the human spirit to live out the Gospel and spread the message to the world.","This movie is far better than your typical Bible or 'faith-based' movie; I admittedly had some low expectations going in to see it and was very surprised by a quality film with a beautiful message. Not for one second did I feel that this was preachy or 'Bible-beating'... it was more pure and authentic and humanist. 
The acting is top notch, with Jim Caviezel, Faulkner, and Olivier Martinez really giving some nuanced and layered performances. Nobody phoned in their roles, you could sense a level of passion and commitment to the story. The music was also excellent, a gorgeous score that was paired with some nice cinematography and production design. The movie looked good and sounded, but importantly - it felt good. 
Lots of films in the devotional genre tend to end up being mere dramatic recreations of the gospels, but this one, while delivering authenticity, was not as concerned with delivering a 'live-action experience of the Bible' so much as striving to express the true message of Paul. That message, the one that is basically Christ's Sermon on the Mount, is the crux of the film. This gives it an emotional heft that is quite poignant. I wasn't so moved by the characters' actions and the story in so much as what they were feeling in their hearts and what they were expressing. 
Dammit this movie hit me right in the feels and I already know it will linger with me for days. That is a good sign that I just participated in some human art. 
Won't win any Oscars, and sadly probably won't light up the box office but this is a fine and beautiful movie with an important and relevant message for the world today."
Westworld,,8.4,"At the intersection of the near future and the reimagined past, waits a world in which every human appetite can be indulged without consequence.","Reviewers say 'Westworld' is acclaimed for its intricate storytelling, philosophical themes, and exploration of AI and consciousness. The series is lauded for its complex character arcs, stunning production design, and standout performances by Evan Rachel Wood, Thandie Newton, and Ed Harris. However, some critics note a decline in quality post-first season, finding later installments less engaging and more convoluted. Discussions often revolve around morality, free will, and technology's impact on humanity, drawing comparisons to other sci-fi works."
The Neon Demon,2016,6.1,"An aspiring model, Jesse, is new to Los Angeles. However, her beauty and youth, which generate intense fascination and jealousy within the fashion industry, may prove themselves sinister.","Going into this film, I didn't truly know what to expect. All I knew was that the promotional images really captured my attention, due to the pretty colors, with up-and-coming actress, Elle Fanning in the center. A ""nymphet"" Tumblr blog I follow also re-blogged images from this. It's some kind of horror (I read the sex/nudity descriptions in the parental guidance section here prior to viewing) that has very mixed reviews.Much of the the first two acts is relatively slow and realistic. It's got great visuals, despite two scenes with annoying flashing lights. The trip-hop soundtrack by Cliff Martinez is also ear-catching. But, boy, was I not expecting such a final act! Thinking back on it, there's a decent amount of foreshadowing leading up to it. As the track titled, ""Are We Having a Party"" played over, my eyes were widened as I realized what had happened to Jesse (Fanning). In spite of its disturbing aspects (notably, a scene involving necrophilia), I ended up really liking The Neon Demon. I appreciate how it chose to make audiences uncomfortable rather than the usual ""lesbianism is hot~"" excuse (ie Birdman). There are critics who hate and/or have called this misogynistic, and I can completely understand why; but that doesn't wane my enjoyment of it.On the official movie discussion on Reddit, users have called this ""David Lynch meets Black Swan,"" which I also happen to agree with.It was great to see Abbey Kershaw on-screen again after her debut in Mad Max: Fury Road - also kind of funny her playing an aspiring model, considering she already works as one in real-life; can't wait to see what else she and Fanning have to offer in future projects!Learning that the director, Nicholas Refn, was born colorblind is very surprising, since his movies are so awashed with vivid colors. I'm planning on watching Only God Forgives and Drive next (the latter generally being considered his best work)."
The Royal Tenenbaums,2001,7.6,The eccentric members of a dysfunctional family reluctantly gather under the same roof for various reasons.,"It seems to be generally agreed that this is Wes Anderson's staple film, or perhaps his mission statement as far as movies he wanted to create: idiosyncratic, campy tales about complex relationships being told in often witty and blunt dialogue. And no one can forget the Wes Anderson tells - symmetry, pastel or earthy color schemes, and Bill Murray. Even though the way this story is told would never happen in real life (it felt fitting that the ""actual story"" being told was through a book), it still feels incredibly human and almost believable in an odd way. Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) almost feels like the hero of a classic Greek tragedy, except the movie focuses more on gathering yourself the day, or in this case, the two decades after. Royal's ex-wife (Anjelica Huston), his two sons (Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson), his adopted daughter (Gwyneth Paltrow), and his children's friend from across the street (Owen Wilson) have all fallen on hard times (meltdowns, depression, drug use) decades after the family drifted apart. Royal attempts to reconnect with his family initially to keep his distanced wife from remarrying a tax advisor (Donny Glover), but throughout the film, he finds the best days of his life with his long-lost family. The group catches up with varying success and share in each other's mutual sadness. There are many beautiful and crushing scenes, heightened by the Wes Anderson style, and the story explores several different feelings and tones. I think the only real problem is that even though every character is written well and intricate in their own special way, and I believe each has an arc as well, there are so many people and histories to keep track of, it becomes a little bit of a nuisance. And the film struggles to juggle all these characters and all of this information in a balanced way; they each kind of have their moment and disappear for a while and then resurface briefly. And this makes the telling of the story a little choppy and confusing at points because you're always wondering who someone is or why they are acting the way they are until you remember through context clues. But if it weren't chosen to have this movie told through a book, I think it might have been much more noticeable. Of Anderson's films that I have seen, even though it is not my favorite by him, I'd say it's the best introduction to one of the best filmmakers in the industry right now."
Boogie Nights,1997,7.9,An idealistic porn producer aspires to elevate his craft to an art when he discovers a hot young talent.,"Boogie Nights is full of surprises, nothing quite prepares one for it its soul. Yes, it does have soul, whilst tackling the tackiest of subject matter, with both a wry smile and respect.  Brillantly cast and wonderful character development, the performances somehow combine the best of stage acting with improvisation within a cinema verite style.The plot proved richer than I expected and the underlying themes are teased out quite profoundly as each ""B grade"" human being is brought, through crisis, into perspective.A sociologist's dream case study, the film resonates the raw truth of what we all know about self-esteem, parental love and lack of it, attention/love deficit and its manifestation in adulthood, the desperate need to belong. Something for everyone here.. almost camouflaged as issues of untouchables and their separate milieu but of course they are universal.The film works on a number of levels. The ironic loop is that the milieu portrayed exists only because of the voyeur, who happens to be watching the film...Boogie Nights is non judgmental of its subject matter and characters, a rarity. It deserves every accolade it has achieved and more."
The Late Shift,,6.7,"A dramatization of the rivalry between David Letterman and Jay Leno over which of them would succeed Johnny Carson as the host of ""The Tonight Show"".","THE LATE SHIFT was an interesting made for HBO movie that took a detailed look at the power struggle that ensued between David Letterman and Jay Leno when Johnny Carson announced his retirement and both wanted to replace him. This struggle is now part of Hollywood folklore, but for those who don't know the story and are aware of where Letterman is now, it might be interesting to learn that David Letterman wanted to replace Johnny Carson as host of THE TONIGHT SHOW more than anything in the world, but Letterman found his dreams being derailed as frequent guest host Leno had one of Hollywood's most powerful agents, Helen Kushnick, in his corner and working tirelessly to get her client the job. It's not often that we get to see behind the scenes Hollywood machinations recreated for entertainment value, but for fans of these two late night superstars, this movie provided a fascinating look at a very turbulent period in late night television. According to this movie, Letterman was practically promised the job by Carson himself while NBC had promised the job to Leno and that's where Helen Kushnick came in. The movie presents Leno as sort of a milquetoast who allowed his career to be manipulated by Kushnick and feigned ignorance to some of Helen's strong-willed manipulations of some of NBC's biggest power players and it presents Letterman as this smart and savvy businessman who, despite having Carson's support, was railroaded by NBC and Kushnick. John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck credibly recreate Letterman and Leno, respectively, but it is the razor-sharp performance of Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Helen Kushnick that keeps this movie bubbling. Bates commands the screen in one of her best, if not so well-known performances as the venomous Hollywood agent who eats television studio executives for breakfast. There is also a wonderful turn by impressionist Rich Little as Johnny Carson, but it is primarily a fascinating story and the powerhouse performance by Bates that make this one worth checking out."
Escobar,2017,6.4,A journalist strikes up a romantic relationship with notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar.,Sadly I missed a lot of what was said because Javier Bardem just mumbles his way through the whole thing.
I Feel Pretty,2018,5.7,"A woman struggling with insecurity wakes from a fall believing she is the most beautiful and capable woman on the planet. Her new confidence empowers her to live fearlessly, but what happens when she realizes her appearance never changed?","'I Feel Pretty' is a mostly-straightforward romantic comedy from the writers of 'Never Been Kissed', 'He's Just Not That Into You' and 'How To Be Single', so it's safe to assume you know pretty much what to expect. There's also a nice twist on the tried-and-tested body-switch plot - Renee (Schumer) hits her head and believes she has achieved her dream of becoming beautiful.Renee believing she's the hottest woman alive is where a lot of the humour comes from, but also some of the missteps - since Renee and her two friends, Jane (Phillips) and Vivian (Bryant), are not actually ugly. It's also where most of the sincere moments come from - it's not all about what you look like, but the confidence you have in yourself, highlighted in a rousing speech by Schumer near the end. She's (mostly) not too over-the-top and is (mostly) easy to cheer for.While not focusing solely on girl-meets-boy/falls-in-love/separate/get-back-together, it still manages to fit that all in, with Ethan (Scovel) a decent foil to Schumer. It's annoying that the backdrop to a film that's actually about not worrying about looks is centered around a make-up company, run by Avery (Williams) and Grant (Hopper) - both mostly pointless. Overall, it's not as good as 'Trainwreck', but nor is it a totally vapid ""chick flick""."
Race to Witch Mountain,2009,5.7,A Las Vegas cabbie enlists the help of a U.F.O. expert to protect two siblings with paranormal powers from the clutches of an organization that wants to use the kids for their nefarious plans.,"I liked the idea, that this is not a remake of the Disney classic Escape to Witch Mountain(1975), it's more of a rebooted version. Some remakes try to be carbon copies of the original, like Pyscho(1998), and The Bad News Bears(2005). This films premise is sort of the same but others ways different.The story begins in Las Vegas, where Jack Bruno(Dwayne Johnson) is a cab driver, and is really not a people person. But one day things change, when two siblings named Seth(Alexander Ludwig) and Sara(Annasophia Robb) enter his cab ask him to drive to a certain location, and they give him large sums of money. Jack is hesitant, but does it anyway. But then things are not so simply, when the government starts chasing them. Turns out these kids are aliens with special powers, that need to get to a certain location called Witch Mountain in hopes to prevent an alien invasion that could destroy earth. And a famed scientist(Carla Gugino) comes along for the ride.Now the moments between Dwayne and the kids are memorable. But the rest of the film kind of falls on itself. The action and effects where alright but nothing you'd call spectacular. Carla Gugino I felt by watching that she was written in at the last minute,cause they wanted a beautiful actress for Dwayne play off of, but Dwayne and Carla have no chemistry. And she does not look like she is having any fun doing this, she is just in it to cash a paycheck. And so was the rest of the cast, besides Dwayne and the kids. I didn't know when too laugh at times, I mean there times it was funny, other I couldn't tell at times if they where trying to be funny or serious for some scenes."
Gotti,2018,4.8,The story of crime boss John Gotti and his son.,"This chronicles the life of John Gotti (John Travolta) from a ruthless killer to the big mob boss of the Gambino crime family. Victoria (Kelly Preston) is his loyal wife. His son faces prison time of his own.This is flat. There is little life to these characters. Travolta is doing an impression and I'm torn about his effectiveness. At times, he's doing fine but at other times, he's hamming it up. There is no doubt about the directing from Kevin Connolly. It is at best TV quality. The son is the key to a character based portrayal. Sadly, the kid playing the role is a muscle head and he doesn't have the skills or the experience. He's not given the chance anyways. There is no heart to this material."
Ed Wood,1994,7.8,Ambitious but troubled movie director Edward D. Wood Jr. tries his best to fulfill his dreams despite his lack of talent.,"I am a Johnny Depp fan, and this film only reinforced my enjoyment of his genuine talent. He's whatcha call a real actor. He's on record (""Inside the Actor's Studio"" & elsewhere) as saying that his characterization of Wood was a mixture of ""the blind optimism of Ronald Reagan, the enthusiasm of the Tin Man from 'The Wizard of Oz' (1939) and Casey Kasem."" Well, I must add that either he left out channeling Jon Lovitz or that's where Lovitz got his inspiration, too. It is at moments positively eerie how well it works, and without feeling like Depp stole Lovitz's act--his overall character is so much more, so much else, that the Lovitz echo becomes a small part of a larger coherent whole, although it never disappears entirely.Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette as the principal women in Wood's life are each endearing and effective in their own separate ways. Bill Murray is fun as always, and the secondary and bit players are very well cast.Martin Landau . . . well . . . Martin Landau simply left me awestruck. Depp is all over the screen doin' his best wacky movie guy and chewing the scenery, Parker, Arquette, Murray, and the rest are obviously having a real fun time backing him up, and Martin Landau is shuffling around in the foreground muttering in Romanian and writing a book called ""How to Steal a Movie."" Mind boggling performance, and absolutely deserving every award it got him in 1995, which included a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, Golden Globe and SAG Awards, and the American Comedy Award for Funniest Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture. (Incidentally, his daughter Juliet, better known to millions of Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans as the vampire Drusilla, is one of the supporting players.)If I weren't already a Tim Burton fan this movie would have made me one. He here makes an almost perfectly crafted period piece (anachronisms noted--see the ""goofs"" page--and dismissed), half cheesy fake scifi B movie and half period noir thriller, as a cinematic biography about the quintessential cheesy fake noir scifi thriller B movie guy. This film goes beyond pastiche, and beyond homage to a genre, although it is both. With this film Burton genuflects--no, prostrates himself--before the gods of 1950s low-budget black and white, and the gods are pleased indeed. It seems like he must have watched every movie made in America for under a million dollars between 1948 and 1962. I lost count of the echoes and parodies and pastiches and mini-homages that fill, I think, every darn frame of the movie, and which by no means are mostly of Wood and his work.As with, I think, every movie biography, there's the odd gratuitous fact changing (see the ""goofs"" page again)--you know, the ""Why'd they do that when the truth wouldn't make any difference?"" kind of stuff, and as glowing as this review obviously is I must also say that it is in some ways an imperfect film--it glosses over Wood's later career, for example. But it it so obviously a labor of love and joy for all involved that in my opinion its imperfections are inconsequential. Ed Wood stands proudly, with that slightly odd gleam in its eye, with the best movie biographies made."
The Hunt,2012,8.3,"A teacher lives a lonely life, all the while struggling over his son's custody. His life slowly gets better as he finds love and receives good news from his son, but his new luck is about to be brutally shattered by an innocent little lie.","Reviewers say 'The Hunt' delves into social justice, mob mentality, and false accusations, highlighting the protagonist's ordeal after being wrongly accused. Mads Mikkelsen's performance is widely praised, and the film's emotional depth resonates with many. However, some criticize the plot's implausibility, particularly the community's swift acceptance of the accusation. Issues with pacing and believability in certain scenes are noted, though the movie remains impactful and thought-provoking for most viewers."
The Miseducation of Cameron Post,2018,6.6,"In 1993, a teenage girl is forced into a gay conversion therapy center by her conservative guardians.","I so wanted passionate screaming at these disgusting ""Christians."" Of course this was in 1993 when homosexuality was not acceptable to most straight people. I'm a straight 71 year old male who witnessed homophobia first hand and even accepted that as normal behavior. Then I had the privilege of getting to know some incredible gays, both male and female. They were far more moral than all of the Homophobic Christians I knew. This film focuses on Conversion Therapy which, extraordinarily, still exists today. It's incomprehensible to me that some people think being gay is a choice, is immoral or is a disease. Unfortunately, most people who don't understand the LGBTQ community will never see this film and those that do will most likely dismiss it as mere propaganda. Chloe Grace Moretz paints a compelling portrait of a teen subjected to this treatment and although she rebels to a degree the accepted values of the day stand in the way of her screaming her disgust at ""authority."""
Exodus: Gods and Kings,2014,6.0,"The defiant leader Moses rises up against Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses II, setting six hundred thousand slaves on a monumental journey of escape from Egypt and its terrifying cycle of deadly plagues.","This is a well known story and I have also seen the '56 movie 'The Ten Commandments'. So in this film could not foresee the modification, but it did in a slight manner like the later 'Noah' movie. The best part was the visuals, the graphics were so good, hard to resist the pleasure if you are vfx geek like me. That's the reason I love modern movie, especially remake of a classic like 'King Kong'. The problem in this flick was lie in the story telling.As we know, Ridley Scott is an excellent narrator, but this movie was too short even though it ran 150 minutes. I felt it was just a brief, I mean there were no details or depth in the important scenes. You will know what I'm saying if you had watched '56 movie I mentioned in a above paragraph. That's drawback for the first timers at a same time advantage for not to fall in boredom for those who have already seen other versions. Christian Bale, awesome; Joel Edgerton, good; Ben Kingsley, never required; Aaron Paul, totally waste.Overall, not cleverly stablised in the scenes that are very important, especially the final one about ten commandments should have been extended a little bit with a moral message. If it was a Peter Jackson movie, definitely it would have been a trilogy with an aggregated time of over 500 minutes. This movie was an entertainer like I enjoyed it than the message deliverer. Must be watched for the amusement and for the pleasure in updating technical aspect of the narration rather than inspiration.7.5/10"
Incredibles 2,2018,7.5,The Incredibles family takes on a new mission which involves a change in family roles: Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible) must manage the house while his wife Helen (Elastigirl) goes out to save the world.,"There is much to like here and not much that is outright wrong or bad. It's funny, fast paced, clever and overall works quite well. However there is an ever present feeling that the first one was better.. Maybe it's cause the plot is maybe a bit too predictable and cartoonish(yeah it IS a cartoon, but still..) or that the wait between the first and this one was so long and I expected something more? It's still good, just not great!"
The Darkest Minds,2018,5.7,"After a disease kills 98% of children, the survivors develop powers and are declared a threat. 16-year-old Ruby, escapes the government facility and joins a group of rebel teenagers ready to fight the government forces out to get them.","I mean, no, it doesn't really bring anything new to the table. But by itself, it's a pretty decent movie with nice special effects and a beautiful score by Benjamin Wallfisch"
The Equalizer 2,2018,6.7,"Robert McCall serves an unflinching justice for the exploited and oppressed, but how far will he go when that is someone he loves?","The Equalizer 2 had less action and less fighting than the first but it was no less good. It had a more serious and somber tone and it was definitely more cerebral. Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) was on the trail of those responsible for his friend's death. He had to use some shrewd investigative skills to discover whether or not her death was intentional and who the killers were. But, while Robert was dealing with that he still had time to do some clean up in his hometown of Boston--and I mean clean up in every sense of the words.I liked the different characters in this movie and I particularly liked Robert's interaction with Miles (Ashton Sanders), the young African American male headed down the wrong path. The high-energy, pulse-racing fights weren't aplenty like the first installment but in their place was a little more substance. It was a fine trade off."
Arany√©let,,8.7,"A corrupt businessman and family man attempts to navigate his way through increasing domestic, legal, and financial problems.","10/10 in the Hungarian league, 8/10 in international level.I have to admit i have seen only season one, but i do not see it as the depiction of the ""Hungarian Reality"" as so many reviewer does. But rather as an enormously good satire of the Hungarian swindlers who had their gold age in the turmoil of the 90's, they kind of got addicted to their routines, and they fail to realise, that the world in which they flourished shrinks to be a petty one.
Like commit a life endangering, prison worthy crime for 1M Huf? (3000 Euro) In 2015? Serious??
Or parking the car everywhere, with a disability certificate, and it all serves as a status symbol? (For any possible reader from outside the postcom region: it is a status symbol, as it shows you managed to pay off the medical staff)
Hillarious. So originally East European, so sourly funny.
Why still 8 instead of 10? Because it resonates too well with the ""you cannot make it in the right way"" postcommunist worldview. And it is rather harmfull, here in Hungary. It is not realistic, and i even dont think, the series is about it. But it still conveys this message for almost all."
The Predator,2018,5.3,"When a young boy accidentally triggers the universe's most lethal hunters' return to Earth, only a ragtag crew of ex-soldiers and a disgruntled scientist can prevent the end of the human race.","Reviewers say 'The Predator' received mixed opinions. Many appreciated the action, humor, and expanded mythos. Some enjoyed the R-rating and found it entertaining. However, others criticized the convoluted plot, inconsistent tone, and lack of character depth. The humor was often seen as forced. CGI effects and Predator portrayal were contentious. Despite criticisms, some found it enjoyable as an action-comedy."
The Adventures of Baron Munchausen,1988,7.1,An account of Baron Munchausen's supposed travels and fantastical experiences across late 18th-century Europe with his band of misfits.,"I've only known one other person who has even heard of this movie(also the only other one who's heard of and liked Mel Brooks' the Twelve Chairs). This is certainly one of the most bizarre and unique movies I've ever seen but the more times I see it, the more I like it. Robin Williams and Eric Idle are great of course, but Neville does a good job too. The story is truly unique, leaving you wondering where fiction ends and reality begins. In fact, it's much like ""Adaptation"" in that respect, come to think of it. While not on par with Monty Python and the Holy Grail, this is a good piece of work. My advice: let your brain take a vacation for a couple of hours and just absorb it. You'll appreciate it better if you try not to make too much sense of it. If it really confuses you, read the book. Yes, there is a book and there really was a man who called himself Baron Munchausen. The book is called <u>The Adventures of Baron Munchausen</u> and the edition I had explained his whole story. Terry Gilliam did a great job of bringing this man to screen and I highly recommend it if you're tired of the usual Hollywood fluff."
Shortbus,2006,6.4,"A group of New Yorkers caught up in their romantic-sexual milieu converge at an underground salon infamous for its blend of art, music, politics, and carnality.","A married sex therapist doles out relationship advice at work but privately spends her time in search of an orgasm, which she's never had. Two gay men find themselves drifting from one another and introduce a third man into their relationship in an attempt to bring some fulfillment back to their emotional connection. A professional dominatrix excels at abusing clients, but brings that abusive behavior to her personal relationships as well and as a result isolates herself from any true human contact. Meanwhile, all of these characters meet regularly at Shortbus, a sex club where everyone is free to be whatever they want to be, where no one's a freak because everyone's a freak, and where, most importantly, everyone feels a sense of community in a scary post-9/11 world.Such is ""Shortbus,"" John Cameron Mitchell's emotionally affecting follow up film to his dazzling debut, ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch."" By now, everyone knows that ""Shortbus"" contains many scenes of quite explicit sex. As happens with any more conventional film that contains material we are used to seeing only in bona fide pornography, the sex tends to dominate on a first viewing; it's so hard not to be distracted by the explicit scenes and ignore the other things going on. However, it is to Mitchell's great credit that I left the film not remembering the sex as much as I remembered some of the beautiful emotional moments, of which ""Shortbus"" is chock full.I saw a screening of this at the Chicago International Film Festival, and two of the actors, Sook-Yin Lee and Lindsay Beamish, were on hand to answer questions. Lee explained what Mitchell was trying to do with this film, and I greatly admire his ambition. She said that he was trying to make an antidote to all of the other films out there that treat sex just as explicitly but in such more negative ways. Sex in our movie culture is usually full of dysfunction -- if it's not downright harmful, it's at best desultory and unsatisfying (think ""9 Songs""). Our culture condones graphic violence in films, many times in combination with sex, but squirms away from sex as it really looks, even though it's one of the most natural of human functions. Mitchell wanted to illuminate this hypocrisy and show that sex can be fun, sex can bring people together, sex can make you laugh. It can't necessarily solve problems, as the characters in this film realize, but it doesn't always have to necessarily cause problems either.My biggest complaint about ""Shortbus"" is that I felt somewhat left out. As a heterosexual male, I don't feel that I was represented by any of the film's characters. Mitchell, as a gay man, obviously has an understanding of gay relationships, and the storyline with the three gay lovers is handled beautifully. But I felt that Mitchell was stereotyping heterosexual relationships in the same way that heterosexuals stereotype gays. The married couple is bored, unfulfilled, caustic with one another. Lee's character can't achieve orgasm until she comes to a sex club and gets it on with another woman. Just once, can't a film show a heterosexual couple who are happy and having a completely satisfying emotional and sexual relationship? I know this wouldn't make for great drama, but it would at least make me feel better.I really liked ""Shortbus"" without feeling that it was a complete bulls-eye for Mitchell. At the very least, he has an outstanding talent and has proved himself to be a young filmmaker to watch.Grade: A-"

24 Hours to Live,2017,5.8,An assassin seeks redemption after being given a second chance at life.,"Travis Conrad (Ethan Hawke) is a former mercenary agent that worked to the notorious Red Mountain agency. Now he misses his beloved wife Kate (Jenna Upton) and son Adam (Owen de Wet) that died, and lives with his father-in-law Frank (Rutger Hauer) in Florida. One night, Travis is drinking in a bar and his former partner and friend Jim Morrow (Paul Anderson) offers him two million dollars per day to assassinate the former agent Keith Zera (Tyrone Keogh), who is a whistleblower that will disclose secrets about the Red Mountain. Zera is now under the protection of the efficient Interpol agent Lin Bisset (Qing Xu). Travis accepts the assignment, uses Lin's son Christopher (Jeremy Yong) to learn the whereabouts of his mother and has one night stand with her to find where Keith Zera is in her cellphone, but does not kill Lin in the morning. However, Lin discovers what Travis did and kills him. Out of the blue, Travis is revived by the mysterious Dr. Helen (Nathalie Boltt) that has developed a revival procedure after several experiments to the boss Wetzler (Liam Cunningham). Travis discloses the whereabouts of Keith Zera and is betrayed by Wetzler, and learns that he has only 24 hours to live. Now he decides to help Lin Bisset and destroy Red Mountain seeking redemption.""24 Hours to Live"" is a flawed but full of action feature film, with Ethan Hawke performing an action hero surprisingly good, which is uncommon to his successful career. It is also a chance to see the unforgettable Dutch actor Rutger Hauer again. The story is flawed, like action movies shall be, but it is highly attractive and underrated. Further, it is filmed in locations in South Africa, China and United States of America, with many car crashes. The conclusion gives a chance to the character Travis Conrad appears in another film, but after so many years, it seems that the studios are not interested. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Um Dia Para Viver"" (""One Day to Live"")"
Fifty Shades Freed,2018,4.6,"Anastasia and Christian get married, but Jack Hyde continues to threaten their relationship.","One of the worst films ever made on the face of the earth. A movie that nothing happens, everything is fake and meaningless, has no story, no plot, the sex scenes are bland and has the worst car chase of all time."
"Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day",2014,6.2,"Alexander's day begins with gum stuck in his hair, followed by more calamities. However, he finds little sympathy from his family and begins to wonder if bad things only happen to him, his mom, dad, brother and sister - who all find themselves living through their own terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day.","This is a nice film to watch with the family. Funny moments follow one after the other, and the message is simple - we all have sh** to deal with but family is the most important component in our lives. Recommended viewing."
Aurora Borealis: √âszaki f√©ny,2017,7.1,"Olga is a successful, workaholic lawyer from Vienna. She discovers a dark family secret that makes her question her whole life. She begins to search for answers, but her mother, Maria has done everything she could to avoid the truth being revealed. While Olga is travelling through her Family's past, she has to face her own life as well.","'Aurora Borealis' is a strongly felt drama, well worth seeing. The emotions are deep, and the movie provides a glimpse into a side of postwar European history, both Austrian and Hungarian, that doesn't get much attention.Although both my wife and I figured out the general outlines of the deep dark secret, it did not damage our enjoyment of this film. The acting is excellent, especially the two actresses who play Maria, one as a young woman in the 1950s, and the other as an old woman in the present day."
Split,2016,7.3,Three girls are kidnapped by a man with a diagnosed 23 distinct personalities. They must try to escape before the apparent emergence of a frightful new 24th.,"This movie will keep you watching waiting for the next character coming out of James McAvoy. He should have won some awards for his performance of a man with many different personalities. James was very convincing in every part he played. The end is great but I don't want to give anything away so I won't comment on that at all. Well written and the actors were perfect. Watch it today, just don't make the mistake of downloading a different movie called Split about bowling. I did that and that is one of the worst movies I ever saw!"
Book Club,2018,6.1,Four lifelong friends have their lives forever changed after reading 50 Shades of Grey in their monthly book club.,"With such a stellar cast of favorites from my own generation, I expected this movie to be enjoyable. It wasn't! It was like watching an operation where the patient flatlines. I kept looking at the clock and wishing it was over.I just adore Jane Fonda, and her show Grace & Frankie is one that I always find funny and unpredictable, and that I can hardly wait for the next episode of. Unfortunately, such was not the case with Book Club. There was nothing fresh or exciting about it in the least. I wonder if it was written in a hurry, or by a novice. I am not hard to please when it comes to movies; it has to be really dull for me to want it to hurry up and end. A lot of people said they laughed all thru it; makes me wonder if they have been living in a cave where they had few opportunities to watch a film.The only redeeming aspect of this film, for me, was getting to see Fonda, Bergen, Keaton, Garcia, and Don Johnson (holy shades of pastel, he's aged well!); It's not their fault that the story was about as interesting as a trip to the grocery store."
Searching,2018,7.6,"After his teenage daughter goes missing, a desperate father tries to find clues on her laptop.","I was just utterly entertained and delighted by this film. Because it was just SO well done.It's innovative cinematography was not presented at the sacrifice of a well-crafted and compelling story. Unlike the Blair Witch Project, these filmmakers put as much time and care into their story as they did with this method of filming. They could have honestly filmed this in the traditional way and it would have still been a worthwhile movie outing. This was indeed a solid work of art.Even with so many moments absent of dialogue or even human characters to watch, the film was always forward moving. The suspense and mystery continuously builds until the very last moments.There were so many twists and turns, they made it impossible to truly predict what was going on. At one point we predicted one thing that did unfold but we were almost immediately surprised by another new turn.There was a story, there was substance, there was intrigue, there was heart. And there wasn't a thing presented in the film that did not contribute to the story.They made my heart break and my heart leap. Made me hold my breath and exclaim with surprise. Made me smile...even made me reminisce a little (due to my particular age).John Cho delivers yet another excellent performance. It was a refreshing role to see him play. He just broke my heart the whole film. I just wanted to reach out and hug him!It was also extremely refreshing to see Debra Messing in this type of role. Nothing I'd EVER seen her do and she was just great.Great cast, in general, tho very small, given the story was told so exclusively from the father's perspective.I really could just go on and on about this movie that I had oddly never heard of...very undoubtedly a hidden gem in the theatres right now.I 100% recommend taking a trip to the theatre for this one."
American Honey,2016,7.0,"A teenage girl with nothing to lose joins a traveling magazine sales crew, and gets caught up in a whirlwind of hard partying, law bending and young love as she criss-crosses the Midwest with a band of misfits.","Much of Andrea Arnold's American HONEY reminds me of Larry Clark's 1995 film, ""Kids,"" struggling adolescent years, but American HONEY is much more nuanced in that on one hand you have this somewhat social commentary about how we are the richest nation in the world and yet so many of our teens live in poverty and they have to hustle and do certain demeaning things just to get by, just to survive, just to feed themselves. On the other hand, you could see American HONEY from the perspective of the characters and the impressive way in which they organize, you can see their selling and marketing skills, despite it being a scam and rough around the edges. They're doing what wall street does basically but on a smaller, smaller, way smaller scale.Sasha Lane plays free spirited teenage named star who leaves her troubled trashy home to go on a road trip with traveling laborers her age, they go from town to town, door to door, to sell magazines. Riley Keough plays Krystal, the leader of the crew, and Shia LaBeouf plays Jake, who recruits new members. There's freedom and hard partying that come with this life, Star doesn't essentially agree with some of the group's methods, although young love and jealousy ultimately motivate Star to bend her own morality rule just to prove herself.Firstly, just a heads up, this movie is 163 minutes long, probably not quite as long as those ""Hobbit"" movies but definitely one that you'd have to be willing to set aside a big chunk of your evening for, should you want to check out this film. I have to give credit to writer/director Andrea Arnold, not only for this raw depiction of American youth living on the margins, but also the casting decisions, the actors in this film are so convincing, in terms of their looks, their attitude and the way they carry themselves, you start to wonder if they really do live on the margins. Many of the moments in the film are spent on the characters bonding, so it seems that, and I'm assuming, cinematographer Robbie Ryan had to sit inside that van and operate the camera around as one character has their dialogue with another, and it's already crowded as it is, it'd be interesting to see behind-the-scenes video on how they pulled that off.Arnold is not focusing on income disparity in the inner cities, nope, American HONEY showcases income disparity out in the plain fields of the American midwest. But this isn't some kind of poverty extravaganza either like ""Winter's Bone,"" or ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" the characters in American HONEY get by, they do OK one day at a time, but they undergo unforgiving journeys through suburban sprawl through small towns clearly affected by economic downturn, and you see the resilience in their hearts. You may disagree with their methods, some might even see it as dangerous but what can a fractured, abandoned life can do but to fill the cracks however way they can. They're still teenagers going through crushes and heartbreaks, your usual teenage ordeals, but they're also in a situation where they're forced to be independent adults faster, and Andrea Arnold beautifully captures all of that in American HONEY.-- Rama's Screen --"
The Man Who Killed Hitler and Then the Bigfoot,2018,5.7,A legendary American war veteran is recruited to hunt a mythical creature.,"With a title such as this it is wholly reasonable to wonder what this movie is about. I think some will still be wondering after watching it. It's definitely subjective I guess. What we do know is Sam Elliott plays a man who lost the girl due to a lot of circumstances along his life's path. I think his melancholy is due to that. He is living with regret. He has a keepsake box which must be very symbolic of it. It is dear to him, but he just can't get to the point of opening it. I'm not sure what is actually in it, but I have an idea which I'll just keep to myself as I think the interpretation of it is a big thing in the movie and it may be different things to different viewers.A story such as this could have been done much more straightforward and I imagine many would rather see Sam in that role. It seems the writer and director is going for an artistic vision that not everyone will appreciate. It's clear in spite of the title and the events direct to it this is not a comedy or satire. It's something along the line of a man can achieve some very unbelievable things and suffer from giving up the personal important ones. He can be brilliant, smart, strong, and kind - even conquering and be lonely as he would rather not find himself one day with regrets that can't be reconciled.. This kind of story could have been simple and linear of course, but then we wouldn't have the title...and the artiness a few will enjoy.This film, then, is only for those few, who will find the art in the telling of conventional late life regret in the most obtuse way here. Sam Elliott, as wonderful a treasure as he is, can't make it a great ride for everyone. But, he comes close even with the events the title alludes too taking a calculated left turn."
Rem√©lem legk√∂zelebb siker√ºl meghalnod:),2018,7.1,"Eszter has a crush on her english teacher, but he announces that he will leave the county for a foreign job. So she starts a sexting relationship with him.","From an ordinary teen drama, to a gripping thriller. I tried to avoid any information about this movie, before watching it, and this was a very good choice. When you think, that you know where the story runs out, it takes a total turn back, and it's not annoying, and don't gives you the feeling, that the film is just bluffing. The twists in the plot was perfectly placed in the story line.
The cast is just breathtaking, full of new faces, and everyone gives their very best.
This movie is a beautiful example of the creative and wholehearted movie making, with slight money, but a lot of extraodinary ideas."
Rio 2,2014,6.3,"It's a jungle out there for Blu, Jewel, and their three kids after they're hurtled from Rio de Janeiro to the wilds of the Amazon. As Blu tries to fit in, he goes beak-to-beak with the vengeful Nigel and meets his father-in-law.","Review: I did prefer the original Rio because of the catchy tunes, but that's not to say that this is a bad movie. The storyline was quite good and the animation looked brilliant. The vibrant colours and the attention to detail was spot on but the jokes weren't as funny as the original. I liked some scenes like the auditions and some of the songs and the new characters were a great addition to the cast. The main problem that I found with the film was that it seemed like there was a lot going on at once. You've got the humans taking down the forest and the main character, Blue, trying to convince his wife that there old life was better than life in the Amazon. Then you've got a human couple who are trying to explore the Amazon and get caught up with thugs who don't want there operation interrupted. Anyway, when you put all of these elements together, it does make a good movie that must have taken a lot of work from the creators, but for some unknown reason, the simpler original was more enjoyable.Round-Up: This movie really does have some top names used as the voices of the characters. From Jesse Eissenberg, who seems to be in form at the moment, to Anne Hathaway and Andy Garcia who voices Eduardo, all the characters really do work together. Even Jamie Foxx, Bruno Mars, Tracy Morgan and Will.I.Am bring some urban flavour to the movie which really works as the comedy element. Anyway, on a whole, it's a great watch for the kids and there is some jokes for the adults which makes it fun for the whole family. Judging by the box office takings, I'm sure that were going to see a 3rd instalment of the birds on there adventures.Budget: $103million Worldwide Gross: $496million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who were fans of the first Rio and who are into there animation movies about birds saving the Amazon. 6/10"
Breaking the Waves,1996,7.8,"Oilman Jan is paralyzed in an accident. His wife, who prayed for his return, feels guilty; even more, when Jan urges her to have sex with another.","The first time I saw Breaking the Waves, I was astonished that Emily Watson had not acted for the cinema before her turn as Bess McNeill.  What she brings to the role of the naive Scottish girl offers a clinic on superlative acting that could humble veterans with ten times the experience.  Another thing that makes this film so special is that it never backs away from its vivid and mature examination of love, commitment, and aspects of the metaphysical.  I easily class this work as one of the top films of the 1990s.  Director Lars von Trier is a true visionary, and the (largely hand-held) cinematography by Robby Muller perfectly defines the tone of the film -- in fact, the theatre where I saw Breaking the Waves posted a disclaimer that warned anyone who suffers from motion or sea-sickness to see the film at their own peril!"
Venom,2018,6.6,"A failed reporter is bonded to an alien entity, one of many symbiotes who have invaded Earth. But the being takes a liking to Earth and decides to protect it.","Reviewers say 'Venom' is a divisive film with mixed reviews. Tom Hardy's performance and the dynamic between Eddie and Venom are highlights. Action scenes and special effects receive praise, though consistency is questioned. Critics cite a weak script, underdeveloped characters, and uneven pacing. Some suggest a darker tone and R rating could improve it. The supporting cast is often deemed underwhelming. Despite flaws, many find it enjoyable for its humor and fun superhero elements."
Almost Famous,2000,7.9,A high-school boy in the early 1970s is given the chance to write a story for Rolling Stone magazine about an up-and-coming rock band as he accompanies them on their concert tour.,"Finally, a movie worth the full price of a ticket! Almost Famous is Cameron Crowe's semi-autobigraphical story of an aspiring rock journalist who goes on tour with a band in the 1970's. If it sounds familiar, it's probably because the story is hardly new. There have been dozens of movies made about the rock and roll lifestyle: the drugs, the sex, the fights, and all the bumps on the road to success.So what sets Almost Famous apart? The acting, for one. Frances McDormand was brilliant as William's (newcomer Patrick Fugit) well-meaning but overbearing mother. Fugit, for his part, had a convincing performance as the shy, awkward teenager struggling to be a journalist but at the same time aching to belong. Kate Hudson, in her breakout role as groupie ""Penny Lane"", gave her character depth beyond what might have been a limiting role. And Billy Crudup, as band Stillwater's charismatic lead guitarist, shines. Jason Lee is always good, and as Stillwater's lead singer, this role is no exception. And I can't review this film without giving a shout-out to the chronically and criminally-underrated Philip Seymour Hoffman, who steals every scene he's in with his portrayal of legendary rock journalist Lester Bangs.The writing in the film also contributes to its effect. Many of the great lines belong to McDormand but there are plenty of others to go around. In addition, the music of the era can't be beat. Everything from Simon and Garfunkle to Alvin and the Chipmunks shows up at some point in the movie's extensive musical score.The plot may not be particularly original, but it rings true. I of course am approaching this review as a music fan and someone interested in the industry. Nonetheless, I believe that even people who couldn't care less about rock music will enjoy this movie, since it's not so much about the music as it is about life. A central theme is the conflict of William: Should he remain a detached but lonely outsider so as to be an impartial journalist, or allow himself to make friends with these people and feel like he belongs? Aside from bringing up questions of journalistic ethics, this dilemma mirrors much of what people in all wakes of life deal with daily.Almost Famous is realistic, funny, touching, and one of those rare movies that makes you feel like you've gained something just for having seen it. It's too bad that they say rock and roll is dead, cause we could sure use more movies like this one!"
Bel Canto,2018,5.5,A world-renowned opera singer becomes trapped in a hostage situation when she's invited to perform for a wealthy industrialist in South America.,"I have never heard of the book this movie is taken from !It's such an unbelievable story you have to watch it to the end. And when it's all over your first question will be -- ""What""?It's like pulling tape off a tape dispenser and suddenly you hit the end of the role and you haven't finished your project. You still need more tape!Mar√≠a Mercedes Coroy and Ryo Kase are certainly the shine in this movie!"

The Spy Who Dumped Me,2018,6.1,Best friends Audrey and Morgan unwittingly become entangled in an international conspiracy when one of them discovers that the boyfriend who dumped her was actually a spy.,"Had a lot of fun with this one.
Turns out 2018 gave me 3 good comedies in all, with the other 2 also being a somewhat genre-bending mix of fun (Game Night, Tag), but I'm gonna go ahead and say this was the best of the 3, boasting action scenes that rival any decent action flick.Mila Kunis is perfectly cast and more endearing than ever.
Her chemistry with Kate McKinnon was also notably fun.
As for the Russian villain found in Ivanna Sakhno, wow... I couldn't decide if I found her to be attractive or frightening. Maybe a combination of both.
Either way, she was terrific.As for the guys, I've always dug Justin Theroux as a good looking decent bloke. But damn... who the hell is this Sam Heughan, with his tall handsome stature, faultless chiselled jaw, blue eyes and perfect wavy blonde hair.
If a straight guy like me can see the beauty in this Adonis, what must straight women be thinking?
Just to be clear, I wish to look like him, not kiss him."
Love After Love,2017,5.5,"Following the death of their father, two sons deal with the trials of their own lives while watching their mother explore new beginnings of her own.",Slightly esoteric and lovely essay on how family members process grief and move on from it -- or not. I've read some of the personal reviews and I wonder how viewers had such a hard time understanding what was going on and puting it all together. This movie is NOT James Joyce or William Faulkner stream of consciousness. The time changes follow the narrative and inform the viewer about how a character got where they are or shows where they may be headed. This film examines how grief affects different members of this family and how it can exacerbate their own flaws and failed relationships. Andie MacDowell really shines here. I thought it was a lovely film and a great debut by the director.
The Last Time I Committed Suicide,1997,5.4,"In 1946 Denver, an aspiring writer who enjoys irresponsible adventures with his friend writes a letter about his life before and after the suicide attempt by his sad, commitment-seeking girlfriend.","To appreciate this film the viewer needs either to be in a jazzy, rebellious sort of mood, or have some interest in Neal Cassady, an American who figured heavily in the development of the ""beat generation"" of the 1950s.Set in the 1940s during one notable period of Cassady's life, the film is mostly a character study of Cassady (Thomas Jane), and his relationship with other people in his life, including his friend Harry (Keanu Reeves) and various romantic interests, the central one being Joan (Claire Forlani).But Cassady was a quirky kind of guy, a rebel, a nonconformist, fun loving, with a restless energy, a person constantly on the move, both physically and philosophically. As presented in the film, he is a cross between James Dean and Jim Morrison.Cassady's offbeat personality is mirrored in the film's offbeat style. It's shot partly in color and partly in B&W. Plot structure seems deliberately chaotic, frenetic, loose. Jump cuts can be jarring for viewers expecting a smoothly flowing, linear plot. And the tone alternates between silly and philosophical. Background music is mostly jazz with some blues thrown in. Accordingly, a lot of viewers will find the film's unorthodox style off-putting.But I liked it, for the most part. The plot would have been stronger if it had focused on Cassady's 1950s relationship with other historical figures, like Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, instead of his romances with random women. Otherwise, the cinematography, the music, and the performance of Thomas Jane are terrific."
Bohemian Rhapsody,2018,7.9,"With his impeccable vocal abilities, Freddie Mercury and his rock band, Queen, achieve superstardom. However, amidst his skyrocketing success, he grapples with his ego, sexuality and a fatal illness.","I'm a 75 yr old Gramma that saw this movie with her son and grandson. We all Loved it!
I ""heard"" Queen music as I worked and raised my 4 children, but never really knew the band it came from.
My children Lived with Queen music, and totally identified with them, especially in their band performances.
My grandson heard Queen because his father played it all the time.
We saw this movie as a family and the movie was about family, friends, and loyalty. The typical band movie is about rising-to-fame, falling-from-fame. This movie is about hanging together as family, as loyal friends ..something we Really need more of today!! The 2 :15 time frame flies by and you're left wanting more...more... more...
Rami Malek is awesome as Freddie! He, his 3 co-stars, last director, music director, and entire crew deserve nominations! See this in a theatre that has great sound where you can appreciate the depth of the music!
One of my most favorite movies in 75 years!"
Christopher Robin,2018,7.2,"A working-class family man, Christopher Robin, encounters his childhood friend Winnie-the-Pooh, who helps him to rediscover the joys of life.","This was the first movie in ages where they did not focus on a romantic relationship but rather exploring relationships between friendship and family. Though, I do believe that the movie isn't suiting for very young viewers. As it might seem boring to them or rather the message conveyed isn't about them. Christopher Robin forgets about being happy due to his workaholic nature, this could really relate more to high school, college or working people. But, overall it's a great movie! It's great for laughs, reminiscing and a little tears"
The Cobbler,2014,5.8,"A cobbler, bored of his everyday life, stumbles upon a magical heirloom that allows him to become other people and see the world in a different way.","The idea of the movie is fresh new ... at the beginning it starts so vaguely intriguing .. if i didn't knew it's Adam sandler's movie and already had watched the trailer and knew it's a comedy i wouldn't get it from that start of New York 1903 story ;)The plot is catchy starts easy understandable and grows nicely to the flip point where the shoe maker uses that magical ""stitcher"" machine we saw on the trailer and wears his first shoe ,, there is some predictability but it was still nice storyline to follow.The screenplay is tight ,, perfectly written, the movie itself is purposeful ,, like literally ""put yourself in somebody's shoes"" what would you do !! Seeing how everyone's life really is ... having his own life, problems, having fun ...etc until things go waaaaay bad :DWell as for the cast ,, i mean come on .. it's Adam Sandler and i don't know but i really liked the short appearance of Dustin Hoffman i like him too,, his role kinda brought some emotional moments to the movie ;)Overall the movie is really sweet ,, not the type of comedy where you find yourself on your back laughing ,, but it works with the events smoothly."
Burnt,2015,6.6,The temperamental chef of a London restaurant demands perfection from his staff.,"Despite some pretty bad reviews I think it's a pretty strong movie. Especially for people who love to cook of like high-end dining, it's a great movie. Burnt gives an excellent look in the world of high- end dining and professional kitchens. Bradley Cooper puts on a good performance and makes the experience very real. The evolution his character makes may be a little predictable, but I think that's not a bad thing. You should not underestimate the acting skills of Bradley Cooper. The character is written for him in my opinion. Also the character that's played by Daniel Br√ºhl, Tony, is an interesting one and I think that Daniel performs this role outstandingly. Tony is a very proper and tight man, but his character evolves during the movie into a very pleasant one. Br√ºhl makes his character very real with the accent and a particular way he moves in. The plot of the movie may be a little predictable, but that's not a problem. I think all the roles are filled in nicely and all of the characters make the story into a real experience, not only about cooking but also about the difficult world of a Michelin-star restaurant. Summarized I can say this movie is a must-see for people who love cooking and things like that. It's not a mind-blowing story, but in combination with some great acting it makes the movie worth watching. An average of 6,7 is way to low for this movie in my opinion."
Bored to Death,,7.8,A well-meaning but struggling writer decides to lead a sort of double life by pretending to be a private detective using the methods he read about in old detective novels.,"Note from the author: this review has been written after watching two seasons. Bored to death is a TV show whose charm relies heavily in its three leads Jason Schwartzman, Zack Galifianakis and Ted Danson. The main problem that I found is that during the first season Schwartzman's character is given the most weight out of the three leaving Danson and Galifianakis as secondary characters that have mini-subplots around the main cases - as the story revolves around a writer drawn to be a detective to solve it's financial difficulties -. Thankfully this has been solved in the second season with an even repartition of plot for the three and consequently has improved the stories, the cast and the overall dynamic of the show. Throughout the two seasons I felt that the show gradually turns from a solve-the-case of the week show to a hang-out-with-us show while the story flows...and boy what a blast it is to hang out with this cast. Danson's hedonistic charm is suave, subtle -and even slightly touching in some episodes with a cancer subplot- with the best laughs when his facade of elegance is down due to his drug use. Galifianakis is perhaps the geek hero (but not a geek himself) as the comic-book writer in a dysfunctional relationship with his girlfriend played by Heather Burns - who's first in the list of recurring character's of the show, also including Oliver Platt and Kristen Wiig-. Finally Schwartzman's character is a struggling writer with relationship problem's and a tendency for solving weird-cases in a very unprofessional way - high point for me is the first episode in season 2 when he has to go into a fetish dungeon-. To sum things up. Bored to death was a slow burner for me, by the end of season 1 I was ready to give up but, with season 2, it pulls out a ""The Office"" and gets much better. Each season has eight episodes which leads to very cohesive stories and arcs but then again the charm relies on the cast which are great if you like these type of characters. Thanks for reading."
Rampage: Big Meets Bigger,2018,6.1,"When three different animals become infected with a dangerous pathogen, a primatologist and a geneticist team up to stop them from destroying Chicago.","Rampage is an unpretentious fun popcorn film. It is worth it just to see a three way fight between a DNA altered Gorilla, Wolf (who can fly) and an Alligator.Dwayne Johnson is primatologist Davis Okoye. He is also ex special forces and he once saved an albino silverback gorilla George when it was a baby out in the wild as its mother was slaughtered by game hunters.When some highly sensitive and dangerous samples that are experimented up in space land on earth, the infected animals grow in size and mutate.George mutates, he grows in size and strength and heads for Chicago with the others because of a single transmitted by the corporate villains who are conducting the illegal experiments. Davis helped by a genetic engineer Dr Kate Caldwell (Naomie Harris) need to track down an antidote to control George and stop the rampage which is destroying Chicago.The film has shades of King Kong and Godzilla. The villains who are siblings are rather cartoonish but Malin Akerman seems to be having fun.It is not a deep film, the script is not great but it is a mindless, cheesy and enjoyable film with plenty of mayhem."
All That Jazz,1979,7.8,"Director/choreographer Bob Fosse tells his own life story as he details the sordid career of Joe Gideon, a womanizing, drug-using dancer.","Read my review of ""Newsies"" if you want my opinion of the musical genre. People just don't break into song-and-dance numbers in the course of their daily lives. Unless they are Bob Fosse, when suddenly doing so not only makes sense, but makes you wonder how we can go through life NOT singing and dancing.What this movie is, is simple: Bob Fosse unveiling his life, his knowledge, and a detailed explanation of his creative process, for future generations to evolve. This film is part biography, part self-exploration, and part legacy. It is the ""legacy"" part that is overlooked by almost everyone. If you ever dreamed of becoming a choreographer, this is the ideal place to start, because you'll watch, over and over, as Joe Gideon (Roy Schieder as the fictionalized Fosse) puts his stamp on a dance number, a process so unique and brilliant that it could easily be classified as its own form of dance rather than a subset of modern dance. If three words could sum up Fosse's style of choreography it would be ""make it sexier."" Then make it even sexier. Then, when you're done, you need to make it even sexier. The ""Airotica"" number exemplifies this, and served as the inspiration for Paula Abdul's ""Cold Hearted"" video.The movie brings Fosse's inner circle and personal life to the screen, pulling absolutely no punches. Some call this film a form of narcissism, but it's hard to see how a man looking for self-given glory would portray himself falling apart physically and personally, the years obviously having taken a toll, as well as the emotional baggage that comes with abandoning family life (and a brilliantly played daughter by Erzsebet Foldi, in what would be her only film before she retired) for a girlfriend with some side dishes for variety. The women hate Gideon's infidelity, but love the man so dearly they know not to question or challenge it.Throughout the film, we are treated to vignettes that comprise the mosaic that is the life of Fosse. Metaphors abound, and the music blends effortlessly into a film that can make two hours seem like two minutes. This is not a film that could have been written and will not be enjoyed by those of simple intellects. So much of the plot exists in the abstract, and it is up to the viewer to find what is often an incredibly subtle symbolism. Simply put, this is a well-constructed film. Fosse's ex-wife and dance prot√©g√©, Ann Reinking, auditioned for (!) and won the part based on her, while the supporting cast includes many solid names, even a young John Lithgow as Lucas. Fosse's daughter makes a cameo in the film, as does the film editor. The comedian who appears as the subject of a movie is based on Lenny, a previous Fosse film.Joe Gideon is what everyone should be no matter what they do: someone who doesn't copy others, but develops their own vision and then methodically, sometimes maniacally, makes it happen. He lives in the moment, and squeezes everything he can out of each moment. This is evidenced by Gideon's brilliant work, but also by his rapidly deteriorating health caused by living in the party moments as well as the serious ones.The ending number is for the ages, putting a spin on the sappy endings that musicals are famous for.Your life is lacking until you have seen this film. That it did not win the Best Picture Oscar for its year was an absolute tragedy. It is one of the five best films of all time."
Susot√°zs,2018,7.3,"During a professional conference in Prague, two interpreters in the Hungarian booth realize that only one person is listening to them. They vie for her attention.","The great virtue of this short film is than you feel its end. You feel the mistake, imagine ""the victim"", understand the state of the two middle - age translaters and the last scenes are not surprising. It is not predactibility. Only a sort of complicity about details, Peter Pan syndrome expressions and the curiosity for have confirmation about the basic suspicion. A lovely comedy, a splendid last scene. Short, in special way, a gem."
The 15:17 to Paris,2018,5.3,Three courageous young Americans prevent a terrorist attack on a train bound for Paris.,"Why Eastwood would direct a screenplay from a Production Assistant/Secretary is baffling. He should've at least looked it over and made changes, or even team her up with a seasoned screenwriter. But what he gave us here, is a flop, and an embarrassment to his filmmaking career.Even at a mere 94 mins long, the slow pacing and overstuffed filler made this feel like a dragged out 3 hour film. Many critics didn't like the timeline jumps, and/or the unrelated backstory of them as youngsters, but I didn't mind any of that at all. What failed those elements is the lack of cohesiveness of the subplots, and the horrible dialogue and constant cheesy useless scenes (e.g. Selfie stick pics). The only decent part was the 15 min action scene, but the rest was a flaccid dragged out bore. Even though the three actual non-actor heroes were cast, they didn't do too bad and were somewhat convincing, but feel they would've been much better with proper writing and directing.It's still a worth watch, even to see the heroes reenacting their real life drama, but it's a one time watch when you have nothing else better to watch. It's a generous 6/10 from me."
The Village,2004,6.6,A series of events tests the beliefs of a small isolated countryside village.,"As with M.Night's other movies, I enjoyed this latest outing, especially the performances of the leads. I think the movie suffered in overall response due to a poorly conceived marketing plan.The movie was sold as a horror film and fans of that genre went into this with that mindset in place. When the film actually turned out to be a look at how we try and protect those we love from the horrors of the ""real world"", fans were upset and rightly so. As anyone that has enjoyed M.Night's movies, all is not what it would seem. I think the marketing pushed too hard the horror aspect which created an expectation that was not going to be met.I think if you go into this movie expecting another commentary on spiritual and moral themes, you are going to like this. If you are going into this for the scare factor, you are going to be left empty."
Unbreakable,2000,7.3,A man learns something extraordinary about himself after a devastating accident.,"A massive train crash outside Philadelphia kills 132 passengers and leaves only one survivor.  The survivor, security guard David Dunn walks away completely unhurt from the accident.  Some time later he is contacted by comic book collector Elijah Price who believes that comic books are merely exaggerated versions of truth and that some people are created weak like him while some are created strong in order to protect the weak.  David develops his talents with the support of Price and his son Joseph and, despite his cynicism, starts to try to use his powers to help people on need.The 6th sense was always going to be a hard show to follow up but Shyamalan has managed to make a film that is almost as clever, emotive, thoughtful and slow.  It even manages to end with a twist that is almost as good as sixth sense's was.  The story moves quite slowly, almost painfully at times, however I found this succeeded in making the film feel more thoughtful and less glamorous.  The director even shots the train crash in a very low key manner, as if to make the point that the film isn't about cheap spectacle or visual thrills.  Instead we follow David as he finds his abilities and gradually accepts them, all this side is fascinating although some of the side stories are a little dragged out.  The twist is only the icing on the cake and if you're into the characters the way I was then it is really impacting.  One bit of advice - don't think about it or try to work it out. Thinking about the twist will stop you enjoying the main story and will spoil the film for yourself.Willis is excellent - he doesn't set the world on fire, but he does a very low-key performance as a common man confronted with so much potential responsibility.  He doesn't ham it up but you know that there's things going on inside his head that reflect on his face.  Jackson is also really good - he maybe plays it a little too weird and should have been a bit more of a geek rather than an uptight art dealer sort.  Willis and Jackson should keep making films together from now on, cause even there worst collaboration so far has still been good - Pulp Fiction, Unbreakable, Die Hard With a Vengeance - it seems to be a winning partnership (Loaded Weapon 1 doesn't count as Willis is only in it for 5 seconds!).  A surprise addition to the cast is Eamonn Walker as Dr Mathison, it's a small role but he is a fine actor and deserves to be seen in big films (check him out in HBO's Oz for a real show of his abilities).Overall it's very slow and may frustrate some people, but if you got the 6th sense then you'll probably get this.  The story is moving and thoughtful and the final scene is merely the icing on a very fine cake."
A Streetcar Named Desire,1951,7.9,Disturbed Blanche DuBois moves in with her sister in New Orleans and is tormented by her brutish brother-in-law while her reality crumbles around her.,"Blanche Dubois arrives in the French Quarter of New Orleans suffering from a mental tiredness brought on by a series of financial problems that have ended in the family losing their plantation. She has come to stay with her sister, Stella and her husband Stanley Kowalski in their serviceable little apartment. The aggressive and animalistic Stanley immediately marks himself as the opposite of the feminine and refined Blanche and Stella finds herself pulled between the two of them. Stanley suspects all is not as it seems and begins to pry into Blanche's colourful past, even as Blanche spots a way out in the arms of the Mitch, a man captivated by her. However it doesn't take long before the cracks begin to show in the relationships and in Blanche herself.It almost goes without saying that the writing here is of top-notch quality. The story is a relatively simple character piece that can be summed up in a couple of sentences, however this would do a great injustice to the depth of development and the convincing manner in which the characters are all written and the story told. It is not so much the depth that some of the characters go to, but the complexity that is effortlessly written into them ¬ñ we can see it writ large on them, but not to the point where it seems obvious or uninteresting. Blanche is of course the focus and she is a mess of neurosis barely hidden behind a front of respectability that clearly doesn't convince her anymore than it does Stanley. Mitch is also really well written ¬ñ at first it is comic that he tries to be such a gentleman while having the brute just under the surface, but later his frustration is heavy on his face along with his anger. The overall story is surprisingly, well, ""seedy"" is the best word that comes to mind. It is in the gutter and no matter what Blanche wants to believe, that is where it stays and the film is right there the whole time.How Kazan managed it in the early fifties is beyond me, because even now the film is pretty graphic in its violence to women, subject matter and rippling sexuality across pictures and characters. It is a compelling story due to the characters and the manner in which they are delivered ¬ñ Kazan's atmospheric direction really helps; the films feels humid and close, and he has done it all with a basic set and a camera. The lighting throughout is wonderful both in the general atmosphere but also specific touches such as the way Blanche manages to visibly age due to lighting changes when the film has slight chances of tone.Of course the main reason I keep coming back to this wonderful film is the actors, who take the opportunity and, in many cases, make it so that it is hard to see anyone else playing their roles. Leigh is perfect for the role and gets everything absolutely spot on; she is vulnerable yet self-seeking, confident yet needy, proper yet unstable. Even visually Leigh is convincing in terms of body language but also the fact that she looks the right mix of ages, looking beautiful one moment but worn and defeated the next ¬ñ totally, totally deserved her Oscar. Brando made his name here and even now his performance is electrifying and memorable. He has his big scenes where he gets to play to the back row but he also has moments where he does nothing other than be a presence on screen; no matter what is going on we are watching him because we are as in awe and yet as afraid of his power as Blanche is herself. Together Leigh and Brando dominate the screen and whenever either of them are on screen it is hard to look away. As a result, Kim Hunter sort of gets lost in the background although her performance is still good. Karl Madden is great but again only holds a supporting role and deserved his Oscar for a convincing performance of a well-written character. Of course it is easier to give good performances with great material than with bad material but there have been enough versions of this play around for us to see how lesser actors can fail where this cast soared.Overall this is a great film that sees so many critical aspects all coming together as one final product. A superb play has undergone a great adaptation that has been seized upon a great cast who deliver a collection of performances that deserve all the praise heaped on them, all directed with a real sense of atmosphere that really delivers a seedy and erotic film both for its time and today. I cannot think of an excuse for people not having seen this film."
Maleficent,2014,6.9,"A vengeful fairy is driven to curse an infant princess, only to discover that the child could be the one person who can restore peace to their troubled land.","I had been waiting to see this movie for some time, and I must say that now that I have, I am pleased to say that Disney did deliver as expected here.The movie was a great and interesting take on the sleeping beauty story, and it managed to capture the essence of the fairytale, but also added much more to it. It was especially great to see the story from the ""villain's"" point of view. But of course, this story differed quite much from the original story.There is little need to go into the storyline here, as it is a class fairytale that I believe everyone should be familiar with. But director Robert Stromberg managed to get a great twist on the tale.""Maleficent"" is a movie driven by its storyline as much as it is driven by the CGI effects. And wow, the effects in the movie were impressive. The marsh really had that enchanted fairytale-feeling to it with the vibrant colors, the marsh inhabitants and the general appearance of the place. And the effects team really managed to pull it off nicely turning the enchanted marsh into a gloomy and dark place once Maleficent had a change of heart.As for the cast, well no doubt about it that Angelina Jolie really carried the movie quite nicely. And the costume and make-up for her was just mind-blowing. If they hadn't gotten Angelina Jolie for the role, I think that Famke Janssen could have been just as great in the role.""Maleficent"" is a great twist on the classic fairytale, and it is well worth watching, as it is entertaining and visually nice to look at.This movie easily scores a 7 out of 10 stars from me."
Barbarella,1968,5.9,"In the 41st century, an astronaut seeks to stop an evil scientist who threatens to unleash a powerful weapon upon the galaxy.","If you're looking for a cult classic, they don't come much stranger than sexed-up and super-silly BARBARELLA, the peculiar tale of an intergalactic secret agent (Jane Fonda) sent to a rebel planet to find a mad scientist named Duran Duran (Milo O'Shea.) Directed by Fonda's then-husband Roger Vadim, the film is less concerned with creating a coherent storyline than it is in finding inventive ways to strip Fonda of her already skimpy outfits.In this it is remarkably successful, and Fonda actually has both enough sex appeal and round-eyed innocence to carry the thing off, emerging as something like a Barbie doll; John Philip Law strikes a similar note as the sexy but equally innocent ""angel"" Pygar. The designs are 1960s psychedelic with as many Freudian twists as the film's makers can come up with, and when all is said and done you can't help but roll your eyes in amusement.True enough, BARBARELLA was probably much more entertaining back in the days LSD, and indeed one might read the entire thing as an acid trip time machine. No one in the cast takes the film very seriously, and neither should you; when all is said and done it has all the depth of a pancake, not so much funny as merely amusing and appealing to a very high-camp sensibility. But as cult movies go, it ranks right up at the top. Give a party and show it on a double bill with FLESH GORDON! Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
Confessions of a Shopaholic,2009,5.9,A college grad lands a job as a financial journalist in New York City to support where she nurtures her shopping addiction and falls for a wealthy entrepreneur.,"I have to give credit where credit is due; ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" does have some engaging moments of comedic credibility. But unfortunately not enough to provide the film with a high interest rate. ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" stars the perky Isla Fisher as Rebecca Bloomwood, a full-time magazine writer who also moonlights and daylights as a full-time shopaholic. Ms. Bloomwoodgale herself persistently shops & shops and has run her credit card balances to astronomical rates. Rebecca is in denial that she has a consumer addiction even though she continues to confront many credit card denials in her shopping sprees. She inadvertently gets hired to work as a journalist in (out of all places) a financial magazine. However, her overridden goal is to work as a fashion journalist in the monarchic fashion magazine ""Adelle"". She starts writing columns in the financial magazine with the alias ""the girl with the green scarf"" on the nightmare of commercial manipulation and consumer zaniness. Yes! That is true! Is this great country or what? Oh wait, memo to self: this is a movie! Rebecca's personal list includes: a humble editor boss whom she falls for, a best friend roommate who tries to control her shopamanian ways, and parents who want to pursue their R.V. road trip dreams. Eventually and predictably, Rebecca does get herself in several hot water scenarios caused by her consumer craziness and persistent blasphemy. So therefore, she does go through the self-realization addiction process. Director P.J. Hogan's stereotypical depictions of the consumer industry did not provide me anything of originality to get all charged about. However, I must not discount the fact that I did like how he directed Isla Fisher. She was The Fisher Queen of this film with her zany but yet fervent performance; Isla is sure to have her master thespian card renewed with other comedic leading roles in the foreseeable future. However, the rest of the cast of ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" are not worthy of a credit thespian increase. Screenwriter Tracey Jackson's script was not of a ""laugh-it-all blue light special"" material, but commendable enough for a few laughs in return. Due to our nation's economic strife, ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" might not be the ideal movie to watch these days; but then again as was previously mentioned- It is a movie! So this yours truly movieholic will try to sale it to you at a moderate price. *** Average"
Life of the Party,2018,5.6,"After her husband abruptly asks for a divorce, a middle-aged mother returns to college in order to complete her degree.",I watched the movie because of Jessie Ennis as I'm a great fan of her dead pan acting skills. Yes the movie is kinda predictable but it never pretended not to be. But Maya made me howl with laughter in the restaurant scene and I would watch the whole movie again and again if that was the only way to see her do that scene.
King of Thieves,2018,5.6,"A true crime movie about a crew of retired crooks who pull off a major heist in London's jewelry district. What starts off as their last criminal hurrah, quickly turns into a brutal nightmare due to greed.","The wealth of acting talent and experience prompted me to want to see this, coupled with an interest in the real life story.I'm stunned to read people find this slow, it's hardly designed as an action packed thriller. It's the telling of real life events. I thoroughly enjoyed it, the story is intriguing, the acting is first rate, plus it contains some very humorous moments.It begins off in quite a light hearted way, it's jolly and funny, but oncr the deed is done, it takes on a more serious tone, the laughs are fewer, and the true greed of the characters comes out.Excellent performances, Caine, Gambon, Courtenay and Winstone all excellent, but for me it was Jim Broadbent who stole the show, he was superb. Francesca Annis was lovely in it, though sadly not for very long.It's not a classic, but well worth seeing for the wealth of acting talent. 8/10"
Bumblebee,2018,6.7,Bumblebee teams up with a teenage girl to protect the world while the Decepticons hunt him with the help of a secret agency.,"This movie was a pleasant surprise.Simple, but entertaining, and much truer to the characters and the spirit of the 80s cartoon than the Michael Bay films. The CGI is nice, and there is a good balance between the serious and comical moments.Without being a masterpiece, this movie is a decent-watch for the whole family.I hope the future ""Transformers"" movie keep a similar tone to this (Or at least, to the initial scene on planet Cybertron, which is easily the highest point from this feature)"
Dreamcatcher,2003,5.5,Friends on a camping trip discover that the town they're vacationing in is being plagued in an unusual fashion by parasitic aliens from outer space.,"As Stephen King fans should probably know, there are a lot of things in Stephen Kings books that make sense only where they are - that is, in Stephen King books. Translating them to film is usually a bad idea, as many filmmakers who had adapted King's books before probably figured out. But along comes Lawrence Kasdan, a talented and acclaimed veteran director, who, with the aid of a no less acclaimed screenwriter William Goldman, decides while writing a script for Dreamcathcer that it would be better to bring along all the trademark King's weird goings-on - and voila! We have a movie filled with telepathy, butt-ripping aliens, crazy military types keen on killing everyone, telephone-guns, indian symbols and even a lot of CGI thrown in for a good measure. Of course, it all fails - but oh how gloriously! I'll go as far as to state that Dreamcatcher is absolutely the best unintentional B-movie trashfest in years! It was totally amusing that such a bunch of undoubtedly talented people (Morgan Freeman, Tom Sizemore, Thomas Jane, besides aforementioned Kasdan & Goldman) were able to make this film without a single smirk - while the material is pure trash'n'cheese. That was the whole beauty of it, for me, at least - the level of money, work and talent that went into creating this film. I would like to personally thank all the people involved with Dreamcathcer - they made my year! Thank you, Lawrence Kasdan! Thank you, William Goldman! Thank you, Morgan Freeman - your eyebrows rocked! And most of all, thank you, Jason Lee - the bathroom scene involving Beaver and an alien worm under the toilet lid is pure classic!"
A Viszkis,2017,7.3,"A rootless young man in Ceausescu's Romania crosses the Hungarian border looking for a better future. With his back against the wall in the post-socialist turmoil, he becomes the most successful bank robber in Hungarian history.","Suprisingly good, i tought to myself.. is this really a hungarian movie? Well made well acted.. Story is good, music is also top, can you ask for more? No, i think it was a top 10.."
Serenity,2019,5.4,A fishing boat captain juggles facing his mysterious past and finding himself ensnared in a reality where nothing is what it seems.,"Just finished watching this with my wife. I'd seen the trailer and it looked good... and it was, until about halfway through the movie where, in my opinion, it went off the rails with a stupid plot twist. I understood the twist and everything that transpired after, but felt it unnecessary and worse, that the movie would have been better without it, sticking to it's original setup. The whole landscape of the film changes after that twist and not for the better - it feels like it exists just so it can exist, and not for the betterment of the story."
Toy Story 3,2010,8.3,"The toys are mistakenly delivered to a day-care center instead of the attic right before Andy leaves for college, and it's up to Woody to convince the other toys that they weren't abandoned and to return home.","Reviewers say 'Toy Story 3' is acclaimed for its exceptional storytelling, emotional depth, and innovative animation. The film balances humor, action, and poignant moments, appealing to audiences of all ages. Character development and integration of new and returning characters are praised. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen's voice acting is lauded. However, some critics find the darker tone and mature themes less suitable for younger children. Despite this, it is widely regarded as a fitting trilogy conclusion, showcasing Pixar's mastery."
Aquaman,2018,6.8,"Arthur Curry, the human-born heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis, goes on a quest to prevent a war between the worlds of ocean and land.","Reviewers say 'Aquaman' is lauded for its stunning visuals, especially underwater scenes, and Jason Momoa's charismatic performance. James Wan's direction is noted for its distinctive style and dynamic action sequences. However, the film is criticized for its complex script, underdeveloped characters, and heavy reliance on CGI. Story inconsistencies and unclear motivations are also highlighted. Despite these issues, many commend its effort to refresh the DCEU and its enjoyable, albeit unoriginal, superhero narrative."
The Front Runner,2018,6.1,"In 1987, U.S. Senator Gary Hart's presidential campaign is derailed when he's caught in a scandalous love affair.","Jason Reitman's film (shot on 35mm by Eric Steelberg) starts off as a Fly On The Wall treatment of Gary Hart's 1988 campaign for President, before dissolving into a typical docu-drama crawl. Too bad, as the early scenes have a certain rush of excitement and even verisimilltude. The momentum gets strangely derailed just when it should be peaking - when the Donna Rice / 'Monkey Business' sex scandal hits.
Hugh Jackman is good as the candidate, even if he never quite nails Hart's voice (and, while Hart was a handsome well built guy, he didn't quite have the physique of Wolverine! - especially amusing in the lumberjack scene). Vera Farmiga and JK Simmons provide solid support as Hart's wife and campaign manager respectively. Sara Paxton gives Donna Rice a sympathy beyond the typical 'victim' stereotype, even she doesn't really look the part.
It's been well chronicled that Hart's sexual escapades helped clear the path for Bill Clinton to clear that hurdle when his scandals hit (not to mention the current Prez). What THE FRONT RUNNER also shows is that Hart lacked the empathy and human dimension that Clinton had that lead to his winning the Presidency. Both Hart and Clinton were policy wonks, but, 'Slick Willie' was a fully rounded personality - love him or hate him. Hart came off like a stolid Senator from flyover country.
THE FRONT RUNNER doesn't break any new ground (and offers little that will appeal to anybody under 50 who isn't a political junkie), despite it's fine start. Still, as an addition to the library of political films, it's an asset."
Hunter Killer,2018,6.6,"An untested American submarine captain teams with U.S. Navy Seals to rescue the Russian president, who has been kidnapped by a rogue general.","Got more than I expected from this action packed thriller. Tense scenes from beginning to end. Multifaceted plot that ties together reasonably. I'll watch anything with Gary Oldman in it but he is unfortunately not in as large a role as you'd believe as a top billed cast member. The acting of Gerard Butler is basically what you'd come to expect from him and he caries the film for the most part. I've seen a lot of comments knocking the realism of the film. I'm not in the Navy, so I can't speak to how all those sequences might play out. But for a movie that takes place in the ocean you would have thought you'd have seen at least one fish!"
Graves,,6.6,"Former President Richard Graves has the epiphany, twenty years after leaving office, that his policies have damaged the country for decades. This, as his wife, the former First Lady, has political ambitions of her own.","I was apprehensive about another political series, but politics are not the focus here; life and maturity are. There are moments of pathos and moments of laugh-out-loud comedy. Nick Nolte has always been an underrated actor. He is fantastic!! Sela Ward is perfect as the strong matriarch. The entire cast are great actors and they work so well together. They are so comfortable in their roles. They are like those chance meetings of people in your life that turn into lifelong friendships. You look forward to spending time with the Graves family every week. The 1st episode didn't grab me, but I hung in there and I am so glad I did!"
Overboard,2018,6.0,"After a spoiled, wealthy yacht owner is thrown overboard and loses his memory, a mistreated employee convinces him that he is her working-class husband.","Reviewers say 'Overboard' (2018) offers a gender-swapped romantic comedy with mixed results. Many enjoyed Anna Faris and Eugenio Derbez's performances and chemistry, though some found the film predictable and lacking originality. Comparisons to the 1987 original were common, with mixed opinions on its charm and depth. Modernized elements received varied responses, making it a decent but not exceptional remake."
Captain Marvel,2019,6.7,Carol Danvers becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes when Earth is caught in the middle of a galactic war between two alien races.,"Reviewers say 'Captain Marvel' is lauded for its action, effects, and Brie Larson's performance, though some find her character underdeveloped. Feminist themes spark debate, with mixed opinions on their execution. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is a highlight, but pacing, plot inconsistencies, and 90s nostalgia are criticized. The protagonist's lack of flaws and generic elements are noted. Despite mixed reception, it's deemed crucial for the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
Tag,2018,6.5,"A small group of former classmates organize an elaborate, annual game of tag that requires some to travel all over the country.","Watch it. It's great. The jokes are mostly on point, the staging is good and even though i hat slow-mo, it really works here. Including the train of thought they play into the scene from the off. 
Would have gotten a better rating, if it wasn't so far over the top from time to time. And some characters could have used a bit more depth, or at least it would have been interesting.Anyways. Good and fun movie."
Mary Poppins Returns,2018,6.7,"A few decades after her original visit, Mary Poppins, the magical nanny, returns to help the Banks siblings and Michael's children through a difficult time in their lives.","How do you repaint a masterpiece: the Mona Lisa of children's fantasy cinema? Some would say ""You shouldn't try"".As I've said before, Mary Poppins was the first film I saw when it came out (or soon afterwards) at a very impressionable age.... I was said to have bawled my eyes out with ""THE MAGIC NANNY IS GOING AWAY!!"" as Julie Andrews floated off! So as my last cinema trip of 2018 I went to see this sequel, 54 years after the original, with a sense of dread. I'm relieved to say that although the film has its flaws it's by no means the disaster I envisaged.It's a fairly lightweight story. Now all grown up, young Michael from the original film (Ben Whishaw) has his own family. His troubles though come not singly but in battalions since not only is he grieving a recent loss but he is also about to be evicted from 17 Cherry Tree Lane. Help is at hand in that his father, George Banks, had shares with the Fidelity Fiduciary Bank. But despite their best efforts neither he, his sister Jane (Emily Mortimer) nor their chirpy ""strike a light"" lamplighter friend Jack (Lin-Manuel Miranda) can find the all-important share certificates. With the deadline from bank manager Wilkins (Colin Firth) approaching, it's fortuitous that Mary Poppins (Emily Blunt) drops in to look after the Banks children - John (Nathanael Saleh), Anabel (Pixie Davies) and Georgie (Joel Dawson) - in her own inimitable fashion.I know musical taste is very personal but my biggest problem with the film was that the songs by Marc Shaiman were, to me, on the lacklustre side. Only one jumped out and struck me: the jaunty vaudeville number ""A Cover is not the Book"". Elsewhere they were - to me - unmemorable and nowhere near as catchy as those of ""The Greatest Showman"". (What amplified this for me was having some of the classic Sherman-brothers themes woven into the soundtrack that just made me realise what I was missing!) Richard M Sherman - now 90 - was credited with ""Music Consultant"" but I wonder how much input he actually had?Another issue I had with the film was that it just tried WAAYYY too hard to tick off the key attributes of the original:'Mary in the mirror' - check
'Bottomless carpet bag' - check
'Initial fun in the nursery' - check
'Quirky trip to a cartoon land' - check
'Dance on the ceiling with a quirky relative' - check
'Chirpy chimney sweeps' - check (""Er... Mr Marshall... we couldn't get chimney sweeps... will lamplighters do?"" ""Yeah, good enough"")Another thing that struck me about the film - particularly as a film aimed at kids - is just how long it is. At 2 hours and 10 minutes it's a bladder-testing experience for adults let alone younger children. (It's worth noting that this is still 9 minutes shorter than the original, but back in the 60's we had FAR fewer options to be stimulated by entertainment and our attention spans were - I think - much longer as a result!)But with this whinging aside, the film does get a number of things spit-spot on.Emily Blunt is near perfection as Poppins. (In the interests of balance my wife found her bizarrely clipped accent very grating, but I suspect P.L. Travers would have approved!). Broadway star Lin-Manuel Miranda also does a good job as Jack, although you wonder once again whether the 'society of cockney actors' must again be in a big grump about the casting! I found Emily Mortimer just delightful as the grown-up Jane, although Ben Whishaw's Michael didn't particularly connect with me, .Also watch out (I'd largely missed it before I realised!) for a nice pavement cameo by Karen Dotrice, the original Jane, asking directions to number 19 Cherry Tree Lane.What the film also gets right is to implement the old-school animation of the ""Jolly Holidays"" segment of the original. That's a really smart move. Filmed at Shepperton Studios in London, this is once again a great advert for Britain's film technicians. The London sets and the costumes (by the great Sandy Powell) are just superb.Finally, the aces in the hole are the two cameos near the end of the film. And they would have been lovely surprises as well since neither name appears in the opening credits. It's therefore a CRYING SHAME that they chose to let the cat out of the bag in the trailer. In case you haven't seen the trailer, I won't spoil it for you here. But as a magical movie experience the first of those cameos moved me close to tears. He also delivers a hum-dinger of a plot twist that is a genuinely welcome crossover from the first film.Frank Marshall directs, and with a pretty impossible task he delivers an end-product that, while it didn't completely thrill me, did well not to trash my delicate hopes and dreams either.But what we all think is secondary. Because if some three or four year old out there gets a similarly lifelong love of the cinema by watching this, then that's all that matters.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

Ocean's Eight,2018,6.3,Debbie Ocean gathers an all-female crew to attempt an impossible heist at New York City's annual Met Gala.,"During more than five years imprisoned framed by her boyfriend, the con woman Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock) plots a scheme to heist the US$150 million Cartier necklace Toussaint from the Met Gala. She is released on probation and meets her former partner Lou (Cate Blanchett) and together they recruit a team of hacker, thieves, forger and swindlers to steal the necklace.""Ocean¬¥s Eight"" is another film of the exhausted franchise ""Ocean¬¥s Something"" with famous cast and cameos. The predictable brainless story has plot holes and is reasonably entertaining. Further, it helps to sleep. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Oito Mulheres e um Segredo"" (""Eight Women and a Secret"")"
Eight Below,2006,7.3,Brutal cold forces two Antarctic explorers to leave their team of sled dogs behind as they fend for their survival.,"This is an extraordinary - and very enjoyable - film, based on a true story about a group of huskies and the people who work with them. But if that sounds like a familiar formula, don't be fooled. This is quite unlike any other film you will see this year.The dogs, of course, steal the show. You probably need to be a dog-lover (as I am) to enjoy it properly - but I would stick my neck out and say that non dog-lovers should also see it. What is extraordinary is that, as you watch the huskies inter-act with each other, you actually understand what is going through their minds - and yet very rarely does the director slip over into the trap of 'humanising' their emotions. It would have been very easy to make this like an overly 'cute' kind of Disney movie, but that trap is avoided. The film is perhaps a little too sentimental at times, but not once do you expect the dogs to start talking!As for the humans, Paul Walker is developing into a very good movie actor, and Jason Biggs is always good fun on screen. The film is as much about human loss, fears and emotions as it is about canine intelligence. It also tells you a thing or two about what life is like in a remote Antarctic outpost.I'd certainly recommend this movie to anyone searching out a couple of hours worth of entertainment. Oh, and there is one moment in the film which is genuinely terrifying: it'll make you jump out of your skin. I'll say no more about that except you'll know it when you see it (You have been warned!)"
Arctic,2018,6.8,A man stranded in the Arctic after a plane crash must decide whether to remain in the relative safety of his makeshift camp or to embark on a deadly trek through the unknown.,"Arctic is for a good part, a solo survival thriller centered around the character of Overg√•rd who has been trying to make it out of the frozen Arctic after his plane crashed. This is one of those movies that focuses almost entirely on a single character with minimal dialogue. Much is conveyed through the body language and facial expressions of Overg√•rd, played by the brilliant Mads Mikkelsen.It's a grim but stunningly icy atmosphere that Joe Penna chooses to set his protagonist in, and we clearly know that it's not going to be easy to sit through. Overg√•rd has been surviving on Arctic fish, trying his best to send out signals to any possible rescuers, and he doesn't know of an escape route (yet!). When supposed help does arrive, it only worsens the situation (watch the movie to know more!). Joe Penna wants us to witness the perseverance of his lead character by putting him through scenarios that get increasingly difficult each time. By doing so, he creates a spectacle that's minimalist but superbly effective.Overg√•rd's struggles make us want to forget our own for a good 90 minutes, and Mikkelsen, the fantastic performer that he is, ensures that his efforts remain worth the discussion later on. The dramatics are barely there; it all plays out so real that when Mikkelsen heaves 'essential baggage' up a snowy hill, we heave along with him. When he sheds a tear, we shed a tear along with him. And when an actor achieves this feat by getting to mouth barely any lines, that speaks volumes of his performance.While watching 'Arctic', one cannot help but recall other popular survival drama/thrillers such as 'Cast Away', 'All Is Lost', and '127 Hours' and how each of these movies has had strong protagonists who we wanted to root for. Overg√•rd can be added to this list without question. The cinematic hook here is how he decides not to let go of his humanity while making his way through the frosty surroundings. That said, the film does rely a little too much on the machismo of Mikkelsen and never rises above its basic, straightforward screenplay (there's no solid backstory attributed to Overg√•rd and how he ended up there in the first place).Nonetheless, Arctic is one of the better survival films that you'll have come across in recent memory. It'll make you want to stay off a diet that has fish in it; maybe even keep you away from air-conditioning for a little while. Arctic is, by all means, essential viewing!"
Coherence,2013,7.2,Strange things begin to happen when a group of friends gather for a dinner party on an evening when a comet is passing overhead.,"Great cerebral sci-fi. If you're looking for aliens and spaceships this ain't it but if you like the twilight zone kinda stuff this is a good one. Maybe I was in the right mood for it but I really enjoyed this one. The characters were believable and what I thought were holes in the plot turned out not to be. not sure I would have been thrilled to see it in a movie theater at present ticket and snack prices but a good rental. Gotta pay attention and don't worry if you can't catch everything being said in the first part as it's just party chatter.Not all questions answered and the premise is not, I think, meant to be exactly the Schrodinger cat thing but just something to motivate the action. Just because the characters discuss something doesn't mean they figured everything out right."
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,2019,7.6,"As Hollywood's Golden Age is winding down during the summer of 1969, television actor Rick Dalton and his stunt double Cliff Booth endeavor to achieve lasting success in Hollywood while meeting several colorful characters along the way.","Reviewers say 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' is a nostalgic, character-driven film focusing on 1960s Hollywood. It is praised for DiCaprio and Pitt's performances, meticulous era recreation, and cinematography. However, it is criticized for pacing, lack of a cohesive plot, and long scenes. The ending receives mixed reactions, celebrated for its surprise yet criticized for feeling out of place."
Glass,2019,6.6,"Security guard David Dunn uses his supernatural abilities to track Kevin Wendell Crumb, a disturbed man who has twenty-four personalities.","Ninteen years ago M. Night Shyamalan made a film called 75 million dollar film Unbreakable when he was hot off the heels of a world wide sensation with The Sixth Sense. The film film did okay money wise (248 million) and with critics but did not generate the excitement of his prior hit but has since garnered a very strong following despite talk of it becoming a trilogy having long gone silent. Fast forward to 2016, Shyamalan after a string of high profile, higher budget flops is now making smaller budget films and gets himself a big hit with the 9 million dollar film Split that goes on to make over 278 million. Not only that, the final post climax scene ties it to the Unbreakable universe, setting up the highly anticipated Glass that will serve to cap the trilogy as a sequel to both Unbreakable and Split.I am happy to report that despite the massive success of Split that Glass is a low budget film made for just 20 million dollars with a great deal of that presumably going to the larger cast. This film brings together characters from Unbreakable (Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Spencer Treat Clark and others) and Split (James McAvoy, Anya Taylor-Joy) with a bevy of new characters. The feeling of comic book mythology that was expertly woven into Unbreakable is back here in spades and this definitely feels more the tone of that film. I won't go into specifics but the story elements of the first half hour feels what someone would typically make as the entire third film in this trilogy but Shyamalan wisely goes into some different territory and we get some great scenes with the characters in a slower paced middle section of the film. Unfortunately not every character really gets to shine here as is common with many team up films each person only has a limited time which makes this film unlike both prior entries really only viewing for people who have seen the others, definitely not a stand alone tale.They make the most of the limited budget and as is often the case with good film makers, it makes them more creative. It is a nice looking film and well made but I think the abundance of POV shots could have been tempered back a a little. The performances from the many characters were all great but as expected James McAvoy steals the show taking on his role from Split again as the man with 23 different personalities (of which he plays 20 here). There were a few things along the way that seemed like lazy or silly scripting that did get a new light once the final twist was revealed. Speaking of twists, there is more than one and he may have overdone it. I imagine the ending will not be for everyone but I enjoyed the film from start to finish, there was a possibility for a while that it would have made the Kill Bill Vol.2 error of promising a big showdown and not delivering but the route they went in the end worked much better. In the end I am happy with this film despite preferring the previous two entries and it has become quite the trilogy.. one that I will revisit."
Holmes,2018,3.9,A humorous take on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic mysteries featuring Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson.,"It's been ten years since Will Farrell and John C Reilly starred in a movie together. Their previous two outtings not only done well at the box office but are now considered to be classic. This movie must have been something many comedy fans have been waiting for... but what went wrong? I don't think I've read such bad reviews for quite sometime. Luckily or some may say unluckily I went to see it before I read anything about the movie.
Honestly, I don't think the world needs another Sherlock Holmes spoof, it's been done to death almost as much as spoofing James Bond but I was in the mood for a comedy and this was really my only choice. Comedy at the cinema isn't as easy to come by nowadays I find, so seeing these two guys in a film together again I thought.... it can't be that bad.
My honest opinion is... well it isn't that bad. Moments made me laugh, I felt it was paced well and although not as good as their last two movies I felt their fans would get something from it.
I do however see why people are disappointed. Ferrell's portrait as Holmes, I can seeing being annoying to many, it's pretty crude for a 12 certificate (UK , guessing PG-13 in the US)..Mostly though I think is the advertising of the rest of the cast. Several actors names are on the posters, they appear in the trailer but are barely in it. Steve Coogan has a cameo at best. Fans of these actors will only come away disappointed. If they were unexpected,I think the audience would come away pleased with their appearances. Like when Bill Murray pops up in 'Zombieland' for example.
Overall it made me chuckle a fair bit, which is the point of a comedy and I can't think of many films that have done thst for me this year. Most of the comedies we get are animated (lately far more laughs in a pixar than in a live action movie) or the odd random film like 'tag' which although a better made film than this, I dont think I laughed more. I do miss the days of looking forward to the latest movies from my favourite comic actors like Steve Martin, John Candy, Chevy Chase and even Adam Sandler. I saw Will Farrell as one of the last of this breed. It would be a shame for this misfired movie to ruin his career. I think in years to come it will be seen as more favourable.
Also I couldn't help comparing it to the Peter Cook/Dudley Moore 'Hound of the baskervilles' another bomb with a great cast. Actually I say give that movie a go, you may realise this one isn't too bad after all.
Hollywood comedy seems in a slump at the moment, we either need to not have our expectations too high or possibly throw movies the way of new talent? Maybe both.
After this I'm not sure this pair will get the chance to make other film together. A shame.... who knows though they may need the money and the audience get the long awaited Stepbrothers 2. At least they tried something different I guess, remember the first 'Police Academy' was great but sequels aren't always the way forward."
The Favourite,2018,7.5,"In early 18th-century England, the status quo at the court is upset when a new servant arrives and endears herself to a frail Queen Anne.","English Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) is fighting a war in France. Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) is her favorite courtesan and is the power behind the throne. Her cousin Abigail (Emma Stone) arrives looking for a job after her family had fallen in status. Sarah looks down upon her and sends her to be a maid. She is being whipped when Sarah suddenly needs her to alleviates the Queen's gout pains. Leader of the opposition, Mr. Harley (Nicholas Hoult), is pushing for an immediate peace treaty while Sarah uses her power over the Queen to raise taxes to continue the war led by her husband at the front.This is a wonderful competition of female relationships. It is deliciously passive-aggressive. All three performances are amazing. The visual style is impeccable. It is a movie of singular vision and great actors."
Murder Mystery,2019,6.1,"A New York cop and his wife go on a European vacation to reinvigorate the spark in their marriage, but end up getting framed and on the run for the death of an elderly billionaire.",It was over the top but that was kind of the point. Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler have good chemistry though
Her,2013,8.0,"In the near future, a lonely writer develops an unlikely relationship with an operating system designed to meet his every need.","This is the best film I have seen all year, and I saw just about every good film to hit theaters in 2013. I think it's because it is so representational of what it's like to be human.There are so many things that make this movie special, but I'll just mention a few.1. The score is INCREDIBLE. The music paired with the beautiful sound design make you FEEL the movie. Sure, you see everything on the screen, which is already beautiful, but then that music hits you and the emotions just start to run. I laughed, I cried, my brain got all tingly. It was an emotional roller coaster, and the score assisted in that so well.2. The script. I knew how this movie was going to end 30 minutes in. And unlike most who would then say that it's predictable and not worth watching, I consider that awesome, because it means that the script is tight enough to tell a good story with a believable arc. Every scene in this movie is straight up powerful! Like it will fill your heart with sadness and happiness and pain and guilt and confusion. And then rinse and repeat. For 2 hours. It moves through all of the most complex and interesting questions that we should be asking ourselves about what it means to be a human being. About what it means to be alive. This film is about all that life is. And after the screening, as well as during, I found myself questioning things in my own life that either don't make sense or don't have to make sense. Like love and thoughts and emotions. They're all so natural and yet none of us truly understand how they work. In my opinion, moreso than any other film this year, Her has the perfect mix of complex ideas, story, and character development. One of the best scripts ever written.3. Cinematography. My personal favorite shot to see and use is the extreme close up. And that shot was all over this movie. The reason I love it so much and believe it works so well is because it allows you to see the emotions of the character so plainly. Like their face is right in your face, so you just have to look at it. And that's where Joaquin shines. He delivers such a powerful and emotional performance and the close ups are there to capture it all. They also make great use of the natural backlighting of Shanghai, and the colors all fuse to make it a really pretty movie. I'd say the cinematography is on par with Drive and/or Lost in Translation in terms of the style. It looks like every shot was photographed with the intent to make it the most beautiful shot in the film. And I admire the DP's work. He did a really great job.More than anything though, this film just made me feel. Everything about it was so beautiful. I didn't want it to end. I felt like the film was controlling me - playing with my mind as if it were a joystick. And that's just something you don't get every day. Very rarely am I awe- stricken by a movie, and this film made my jaw drop. It is without a doubt the best film of the year, and upon just one viewing, one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time."
On Chesil Beach,2017,6.3,"In 1962 England, a young couple find their idyllic romance colliding with issues of sexual freedom and societal pressure, leading to an awkward and fateful wedding night.","Edward and florence have both just gotten their uni degrees. They fall in love and get married. But they have very different personalities; florence appears so strong and confident, but has her own unspoken past to deal with. Edward is still very young and innocent, and lacks florence's headstrong manner. This story is about how they handle their various issues. Edward seems to be overwhelmed by his own situation at home. Throw in a proud, stubborn streak, and his own inexperience, sexually. Like most young and foolish newlyweds, they don't really communicate properly. Anger and pride keep them both from listening and understanding. The actors do a great job, but it gets quite bleak and dark. Some beautiful scenery of dorset area. And snippets of beautiful classical music, as that is florence's profession. Directed by dominic cooke. Story by ian mcewan."
A Dog's Way Home,2019,6.7,A female dog travels four hundred miles in search of her owner throughout a Colorado wilderness.,I knew what it was going into it and it did not disappoint. I'll take animals over most people any day. I never saw any of the things these other reviews point out. I was entertained. I cried. I laughed. I went home and hugged my two American Staffordshire Terriers very tight. Thank you for this movie.
The Last Days of Disco,1998,6.7,"Story of two female Manhattan book editors fresh out of college, both finding love and themselves while frequenting the local disco.","In the early 80's a group of friends interact around a Manhattan disco, desperate to climb the local social ladder.  With an investigation in the disco's financial dealings and the end of disco approaching the friends attempt to carry on as normal.Director Whit Stillman tends to go for comedies that look inward and have strong comedic dialogue that follow social observations and comment on different cultures and periods.  However plot is never one of his major concerns and here is no different.  The story here is less important that the period of disco which is the real focus.  This may be a bit frustrating to some as the story doesn't seeming to have any one direction.  However the characters and the dialogue will generally hold the interest sufficiently. Some of the script is a bit weak and the characters occasionally are a bit too unsympathetic but for the majority the sharp script compliments the characters.The performances are good throughout - these socialites are not people I'd ever like to meet but they are funny from a distance.  There is much to like here if you like this type of humour.  But the story is almost non-existent and this is a slight problem.Overall a clever, funny look at the life of a couple of party girls around the time disco started to suck. Not to everyone's taste and what's that credit sequence ending about? - is it a bit of fun or is it trying to say something?"
Set It Up,2018,6.5,Two corporate executive assistants hatch a plan to match-make their two bosses.,"Netflix's ""Set It Up"" - the debut feature of TV directing veteran Claire Scanlon (while heavily pregnant) - never quite innovates enough to push beyond the conventions of rom-com genre. Character development is weak and the story makes this film the kind of production which makes Netflix seem like the internet bargain bin for entertainment, but what's the harm in an easy-to-swallow movie that makes you feel good? This is escapism at its finest and thanks to the cast film is definitely worthy of your time. In the end, ""Set It Up"" may have an extremely familiar story, but it's also sweet and adorable (at times) showing that love or even sex can be powerful and really change people.Rating: 6+/7- (Fun)"
The Age of Adaline,2015,7.2,"A young woman, born at the turn of the 20th century, is rendered ageless after an accident. After many solitary years, she meets a man who complicates the eternal life she has settled into.","The acting in this I cannot fault, though Adeline has a very low range of emotions given the material, her demure persona is a sign of the times in which she was raised. Perhaps it was the stiff upper lip if the early 20th century? I have never seen the male lead and he suited his part well.I watched this with my mother and daughters ( sobbing continued on both sides with both generations for different reasons, but both centred around loss). I felt torn, suitably watching this with both generations, as to what part of the film affected me most. Those with children and aging parents will understand when viewing this.The soundtrack was beautiful and the song played during the most emotive scenes is both beautiful and haunting enough for me to seek it out.A beautiful movie, which is a little in the fantasy realm in its explanation behind the mortality/immortality aspect which makes it almost fairy tale like, but beautifully executed, and gorgeously told. See it with your mother or daughter, or like I did, both! Take your tissues!"
Joker,2019,8.3,"Arthur Fleck, a party clown and a failed stand-up comedian, leads an impoverished life with his ailing mother. However, when society shuns him and brands him as a freak, he decides to embrace the life of chaos in Gotham City.","Reviewers say 'Joker' has received mixed reactions, with many praising Joaquin Phoenix's Oscar-worthy performance and the film's deep exploration of mental illness and societal neglect. The fresh take on the Joker character is lauded, along with the cinematography and score. However, some critics find the film overrated, unoriginal, and overly violent, with issues regarding pacing, script, and lack of clear messages. Despite these criticisms, its thought-provoking themes are widely celebrated."
Instant Family,2018,7.3,A couple find themselves in over their heads when they foster three children.,I've literally NEVER reviewed anything before. I've never felt I needed to...That being said - As I was a foster child this hit me square in the face. It was one of the hardest movies for me to watch. Its depiction of how the kids act is 100% accurate. Its one of the hardest things to see and admit now - Being that I'm older.This movie needs more attention and I hope that my rating helps with that. It needs to be watched by all... I was laughing AND crying (I'm ex-Navy and a very stoic person).
What Men Want,2019,5.4,"A woman is boxed out by the male sports agents in her profession, but gains an unexpected edge over them when she develops the ability to hear men's thoughts.","I think in the terms of Romcoms this movie ranks above average.You know what you're getting into by choosing this movie, it's a romcom about a woman trying to figure out what men want.
Then how are people hating on it so much? I don't get it. It delivers what it promises, nothing fancy, no plot twists, no unique writing, enjoyable fun acting, just mindless bubbly fun.Taraji P Henson is a bowl of energy and sunshine that keeps the rhythm of this movie constantly up and high and she elevates the whole movie. The movie really banked on this as well, almost every scene has her which is great.Supporting characters are barely memorable except Max Greenfield (Who played Schmidt on New Girl) simply because I like the actor. Rest are forgettable.Plot is simple, nothing that unique but fun, it follows the basic romcom formula but nothing wrong with that.Are there better Romcoms, yes of course.
Are there worse, many.Don't believe on those 1 star 2 star reviews I'd say, the IMDb rating is quite accurate 5-6 star ballpark is much suited for this movie.If you're in the mood of bubbly fun movie I'd say go for it. I personally quite enjoyed this movie."
The Interview,2014,6.5,"Dave Skylark and his producer Aaron Rapaport run the celebrity tabloid show ""Skylark Tonight"". When they land an interview with a surprise fan, North Korean dictator Jong-Un Kim, they are recruited by the CIA to assassinate him.","Alright so let's get this out of the way. I'm giving huge props to Sony for releasing this movie after being threatened and hacked. With that being said my new found love for Sony has nothing to do with this review, I'm simply giving my opinion as if none of that ever happened.Rogen and Franco. They're the modern day David Spade and Chris Farley, or at least they're getting there. They're on the same level as Ferrell and Reilly and Hill and Tatum. You get my point, they work well together...like peanut butter and......okay enough with the comparisons.The movie is a satire, that's something you have to realize and accept before you ever even watch it. Do not go into it expecting it to be realistic or within reason. If you have a preconceived idea that the movie will be in the realm of realism then don't even bother. With that being said, the movie was well thought out in the way of being what it is and these two pull it off perfectly. Franco being the dumb one who's idiotically friendly to the wrong people and Rogen being the one with whatever sense of responsibility you could ever picture him having to begin with. The movie and their characters, in that sense, could be compared to their roles in Pineapple Express. If you liked Pineapple Express, you'll like this movie too because it comes with that same sense of humor that just works.There were very few parts that were like ""okay, is this going to pick up?"" and there were parts (more often that not) that were near non-stop hilarious. There are some jokes and comments in there that I've never heard elsewhere that were purely brilliant and hilarious.Sony spent A LOT of money making this movie and you can tell. It doesn't have that cheesy feel to it the way the ""Scary Movie"" series does, it's not that kind of satire or parody. The feel of the movie really was just like Pineapple Express. It's not overly done in a cheesy type of way at all. You really should watch it for yourselves, and not just because you want to give the big ""f-you"" to North Korea and its hackers-watch it because it's classic Rogen-Franco genius comedy.7 out of 10, pushing 8 out of 10. Movies nowadays hardly ever make me laugh and I don't like stupid humor like Napoleon Dynamite or the cheesiness of movies like Scary Movie and I can say that this made me laugh like I haven't in a while."
The Aftermath,2019,6.4,"Post World War II, a British colonel and his wife are assigned to live in Hamburg during the post-war reconstruction, but tensions arise with the German who previously owned the house.","Keira knows how to outshine others when it comes to delivering classic, carved out acting without a hitch and she does that with all the panache and finesse and how in this - days of yore world war time saga of romance and despair and compassion in a power packed rendition which not many can. Measured and mature, reflecting the welled up tragic circumstances and carrying the sublime hint of static grief in posture & expression, making the viewer drown slowly into her gaze and dialogue rendition as a natural propensity that emotes from all angles. It grows over you gradually and holds you to a thrall throughout the movie without your knowledge. Stupendous is a mere adjective to describe it.The movie starts slowly from a point where the WW2 has just ended and Allied Forces have occupied Germany which is in shambles at the end of war. The story begins at a shattered and in ruins Hamburg in 1945. Keira joins her hubby Jason Clarke (of White House Down & Everest Fame) Who is a Colonel in Brit Army, in charge of rebuilding and deNazifying Germany. They move into a classic German Mansion belonging to a well-off widower Alexander Skarsgard (of Straw Dogs, Legend of Tarzan, Hold The Dark fame) and his daughter which is been selected by the Allied Forces for the Colonel. Keira has lost her son in German bombing over London and Alexander has lost his wife in Allied bombing of Germany so there is enough tragic past on both sides. The movies opens to this background slowly.One oddity is the Mansion looks so classy and almost contemporary with British Piano, finely carved wooden work and pretty modern looking seating while nearby it is full of rubble and dust and bombed out exterior which looks little outlandish when you look at the Mansion and war-torn land outside. Well it is a minor aberration though it does register in the mind. The movie picks up pace may be from the 20th minute onwards and then it keeps you engrossed totally in it till the end of its total length of 140 plus minutes of run time. Let me go silent now since saying anything more may be a spoiler. The movie though starts slow, unfolds in a crafty step by step manner and turns its head on you with its at times predictable turns but with more finesse than you expect every time. It's a Keira Show all the way with excellent supporting roles by Clarke & Skarsgard. Clever delivery of halted dialogues are good too since you more or less get the complete line. That's kind of charming.Pretty sublime direction by James Kent too who gave us 13th Tale, Margaret & 13th Tale kind of movies. Has managed to extract good performances by the star cast. Effectively mirrors the feelings of mistrust, tension in the air, grief, passion, sub plots within the story & hostility without much ado. The screenplay is tight and neat and well rendered with consummate ease.To sum up, The Aftermath is a better movie without a doubt. Keira delivers the punch with more than VFM performance. One can never believe she has Dyslexia at all!!! And the aftermath is a feel good factor which it leaves you with aplenty."
Life Itself,2018,6.9,"As a young New York City couple goes from college romance to marriage and the birth of their first child, the unexpected twists of their journey create reverberations that echo over continents and through lifetimes.","Interesting how much ""professional"" critics, users reviews, and IMDB score vary. That itself tells you there's something special about this movie. I thought it was excellent. It takes you on a fast & violent emotion roller-coaster, and yes, statistically some of the plot is unlikely, but the emotions rung true to me, and I don't care about statistical anomalies if they serve the story. Quite a few reviews compare this to a French movie, though I'm unsure what that means. I'm French, and I'm surely biased, but at least it's not soup: it's drama. The movie clearly offended a lot of people, which is ironic, because that's the point the movie's making: life is fierce, and it's beautiful."
In Bruges,2008,7.9,"After a job gone wrong, hitman Ray and his partner await orders from their ruthless boss in Bruges, Belgium, the last place in the world Ray wants to be.","Greetings again from the darkness. Award winning playwright Martin McDonagh brings his amazing writing talents to the big screen and scores with his first turn as a feature film director. The city of Bruges (yes, in Belgium) is the perfect setting for the multi-layered story. Its well preserved medieval architecture is like an character unto itself.Colin Farrell delivers by far his best performance to date. He is funny, dangerous, sexy and emotional throughout. This is exceptional acting from a guy who tends to disappoint. Of course, it helps to have magnificent writing and this one most certainly delivers on that front. The dialogue is quirky and quick ... so tune in early.Strong work also from Brendon Gleeson, who all will recognize from ""Gangs of New York"" and the Harry Potter series. He is a tough guy with a streak of humanity. The third piece of the puzzle is Ralph Fiennes as the mastermind bad guy. The supporting work is fine from Jordan Prentice as the dwarf actor (sadly Mr. Prentice is most famous for playing Howard the Duck) and a very cute Clemence Poesy as Farrell's odd love interest.Very few writers can write dialogue like this and even fewer can juggle as many layers without making a film seem busy, crowded or forced. Hopefully Mr. McDonagh will bring more of his work to the big screen ... he certainly adds a touch of class!"
Black Mirror,,8.7,"Featuring stand-alone dramas -- sharp, suspenseful, satirical tales that explore techno-paranoia -- ""Black Mirror"" is a contemporary reworking of ""The Twilight Zone"" with stories that tap into the collective unease about the modern world.","Reviewers say 'Black Mirror' is acclaimed for its initial seasons, offering insightful commentary on technology and society with compelling narratives and performances. Later seasons, especially 5 and 6, face mixed to negative feedback for straying from core themes. Critics note a decline in originality, depth, and technological focus. Some episodes are deemed predictable and overly reliant on celebrity casting. Despite these issues, 'Black Mirror' remains influential in sparking discussions about tech and human behavior."
Aloha,2015,5.4,A celebrated military contractor returns to the site of his greatest career triumphs and reconnects with a long-ago love while unexpectedly falling for the hard-charging Air Force watchdog assigned to him.,"Mostly panned by critics, I have to say, I really didn't mind this film at all. The critics are simply wrong here, at least to my tastes they are. A few aspects may not have worked so well, sure, but I feel many aspects did work quite well. I enjoyed the vast subject matter, the entertaining cast, and the unique energy this film has. The storytelling here in my view is another interesting one in a long line of good and different Cameron Crowe films. When most of Hollywood is making very safe and predictable films, at least we still have a few American directors willing to do something different and willing to bring attention to often overlooked (or even new), issues. Most of all though it is the very grounded human feelings in Cameron Crowe films that really make them work for me. This is no exception. To me this was a fun, heartfelt, and somewhat thought provoking film. The critics can keep giving mindless films like Guardians of the Galaxy and Mad Max:Fury Road good reviews, but for me, this film kicks both their asses easily. 7/10"
American Made,2017,7.1,"The story of Barry Seal, an American pilot who became a drug-runner for the CIA in the 1980s in a clandestine operation that would be exposed as the Iran-Contra Affair.","Very few directors have tapped the clown in Tom Cruise the way Doug Liman has. He had directed Tom in Edge of Tomorrow which was humorous and was set amidst a post-apocalyptic alien invasion. American Made is just as humorous and is also set amidst an invasion of sorts except this movie is a true story. Captain Barry Seal had the adventure of a lifetime before falling prey to a monster of his own doing. But what an adventure it might have been for this man to smuggle contraband into and out of the States.I felt Tom Cruise did a great job portraying the pilot in an extremely light-hearted and funny way. Cruise is known for playing roles that ooze oodles of dare-devilry. But most of those roles are of fictitious characters. For once Tom plays a real man whose daring knew no bounds. Captain Barry Seal was like a real-life Ethan Hunt. Hence I feel casting Cruise as Seal was an extremely appropriate decision and should help in filling Universal Studios Entertainment's coffers.If you were awed after seeing the aerial sequences in Dunkirk, wait until you have seen this film. The planes are subjected to go through some intense acrobatics which will please you. If you were disappointed with Cruise after watching The Mummy, I can assure you that you will heave a sigh of relief after watching this film. The film's story is not only engaging but also witty and hilarious. There are hardly any stagnant moments so the probability of you getting bored is very low.A very ironic thing about American Made is that in 1986 when Barry Seal must have gone through whatever turmoil he did, a young Tom Cruise played a pilot in Top Gun which released that year. Did he know he would pay a real-life pilot who was very relevant during those days almost 31 years later ?Watch American Made . Don't watch it for Tom Cruise's stardom. Watch it because you deserve to watch an entertaining and great film on the big screen that coincidentally has a superstar playing the leading man. I humbly apologize for the length of this post but sometimes I just can't control myself from pouring my thoughts out"
This Is the End,2013,6.6,"Six Los Angeles celebrities are stuck in James Franco's house after a series of devastating events just destroyed the city. Inside, the group not only have to face the apocalypse, but themselves.","A vanity project for a bunch of Hollywood's highest paid comedic actors, playing themselves in a ""stoner comedy"". So how do you make that good? By making it an hilarious, smart, insightful, satirical and scathing commentary on religion, celebrity and Los Angeles. And how do you make that successful? By making it a stoner comedy about a hapless group of actors saying and doing the stupidest things.It actually starts out pretty slowly with a lame story being introduced. Jay Baruchel comes to LA to hang out with his friend Seth Rogen who wants to hang out with his friends James Franco, Jonah Hill and Craig Robinson, but Jay doesn't like his friends and he doesn't think that they like him. Sounds kind of lame doesn't it? The party at James Franco's house delivers the ridiculous, raunchy comedy which the target audience craves but it doesn't yet include the intelligence which the rest of the audience is applauding.It seems like everybody in Hollywood is at James Franco's house. Michael Cera is doing coke, Jonah Hill is being friendly and everybody else is finding another drug to imbibe. While Jay and Seth are off to buy cigarettes, the Heavens open up and the Earth caves in. And then the real fun begins. Knowing the title of the film, or having read the bible, or really having seen any loose interpretation of the apocalypse, it's pretty obvious what is happening. And we get our first glimpse of the film's take on the celebrity culture and what it does (and what will eventually happen) to those at the center of it.Our heroes aren't quite sure what's going on. Remember, they are actors in Hollywood. It's probably an earthquake, or it could be a zombie invasion, or it could be the end of the world as described in the New Testament's Revelation. But who believes that stuff?The majority of the film takes place with our five actors holed up in James Franco's house ‚Äì which is like a cement cave designed by himself since he's an artist. The jokes are vulgar, crass, silly but also incredibly insightful into who they are and the result is a perfectly written self-parody. You have to get past a lot of penis jokes, but once you do, you'll find an under-current tackling the issues of celebrity status but also of celebrities' biggest detractors, the religious congregation. I don't think ""This Is the End"" will be successfully duplicated any time soon, but I also don't foresee the apocalypse hitting any time soon."
Christmas with the Kranks,2004,5.5,"With their daughter Blair away in Peru, Luther and Nora Krank decide to skip Christmas altogether until she decides to come home, causing an uproar when they must celebrate it at the last minute.","So I'm giving this a 10 although it's more of an 8. Certainly not a 5.3! I don't know what people expect but I found it very funny & entertaining. Might have something to do with Tim Allen & Dan Ackroyd, two of my favorites. The book, Skipping Christmas by John Grisham, is also very good."
Marriage Story,2019,7.9,A stage director and his actor wife struggle through a grueling divorce that pushes them to their personal and creative extremes. Noah Baumbach's incisive and compassionate look at a marriage breaking up and a family staying together.,"This movie is unequivocally carried by its stellar acting performance from its leads. Throughout the movie, you will feel the emotions of the actors and actresses on the screen and what they are going through. And the story itself does a good job at trying not to paint a black and white picture of a divorce instead making it a grey affair where both the man and the woman are in some part in fault. This is one of 2019s best acting and you need to see it just for that."
The Irishman,2019,7.8,"An illustration of Frank Sheeran's life, from W.W.II veteran to hit-man for the Bufalino crime family and his alleged assassination of his close friend Jimmy Hoffa.","First off, let me set this straight that I'm not repeled by long or slow films. However, The Irishman is at the very least 30-40 minutes too long, and the suspense sometimes is killed off by characters dragging the scene too much. The biggest offender would be the second last arc which I'm not gonna spoil.Secondly, for such a slow film you'd expect the pay off to be worth it, but it isn't. The message of the film is revealed very early on, and it's very obvious where this particular plot line is going to. These 2 factors (slow pace and obvious plotline) make the film feels particularly unrewarding to me.Third is the lack of the 'wow' factor, which is disappointing for such a godlike cast and crew. There is not a single memorable scene or line that stands out for me, despite the actors all doing a phenomenal job. And no, I don't really mind the CGI, even though it's not the best thing since sliced bread. The music is not memorable either, even though it can be an artistic choice to make the film feels more grounded and unglamorous.So where does this leave us? Personally I don't think this is a bad film, but it feels disappointing with such a big roster. Don't expect this to be the film to watch with friends over, as it's pretty (unneccessarily) lengthy and the undertone is meant to be a heavy one."
The Mummy,2017,5.4,"An ancient Egyptian princess is awakened from her crypt beneath the desert, bringing with her malevolence grown over millennia and terrors that defy human comprehension.","I get it, it's not a reboot of the Brendan Fraser Mummy of 1999 onward. It's an attempt to create a whole new cinematic world, or rather cinematic universe. Populated with super beings, over which none will claim rights from Universal Studios. Beings that Universal own already. It's an interesting idea with some financial wisdom behind it. It could've been a real stroke of genius if it was done with the right amount of levity. The Brendan Fraser style of humor is badly needed here, but he's not here, neither is anybody else who can take himself lightly. So instead we get a dark, pompous serious attitude debating which way is it we should use to triumph over evil altogether.Cinematically it means tons of CGI, and every kind of monster the script writer could find in the archives of Universal St. and some from other cinematic archives too. It was a bit much when they tried it on 2004 with Van Helsing. And Hugh Jackman never repeated that mistake. So Tom Cruise is here to take his place. Truth is, we should've seen it coming. Tom Cruise must've wanted to be Superman all these years, but even he knew he wasn't physically suitable so he relented into an endless list of action heroes that were borderline super beings but not actually super. Thing is, he's not getting younger, and the idea of doing his own stunts is getting less and less practical, so Tom Cruise found the ultimate solution, he went in and made himself a god.Yes if you do want to watch it, you need to do more than just suspend your judgment. You'll have to kill it and make sure it doesn't come back to haunt you."
Nyitva,2018,6.3,Relationship dramedy about an everyday couple adventuring through the confusing thrills of non-monogamy.,Thoroughly enjoyable film about the pitfalls of modern relationships - giving me food for thought. Characters are relatable and very likable in their quest to maneuver the depths of monogamy. Very outspoken - may make you blush - but great dialogue.
The Christmas Chronicles,2018,7.0,"The story of sister and brother, Kate and Teddy Pierce, whose Christmas Eve plan to catch Santa Claus on camera turns into an unexpected journey that most kids could only dream about.",Excellent fun! Enough humour for kids and adults. Anyone not liking this is definitely on the naughty list!Kurt Russell probably had more fun with this movie than anything else he has ever done.Going to be a Christmas classic...you'll see.
Apt Pupil,1998,6.7,A boy blackmails his neighbor after suspecting him to be a Nazi war criminal.,"It's been a while since I last watched this, or read the book, but I still recall the palpable feeling of dread, of discomfort, of witnessing one young boy's descent into pure darkness...it's all still there.Sir Ian McKellen is masterful as the Nazi doctor in hiding, and it's interesting looking back now that he's played a Holocaust survivor - Magneto in the X-Men movies - AND one of the depraved minds behind it - Kurt Dussander here. Then at the other end of that spectrum, it's kinda sad looking back on this and seeing how good Brad Renfro was, how good he could have been had he not died so young...Anyway, it's a damn good movie that still holds up really well now, almost 30 years later."
Elliot the Littlest Reindeer,2018,5.0,"When Blitzen announces his retirement on December 21st, a miniature horse has 3 days to fulfill his lifelong dream of earning a spot on Santa's team at the North Pole try-outs.",Clearly not a lot of thought went into this one. We could anticipate most of it.
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,2019,7.3,"Fugitive Jesse Pinkman runs from his captors, the law, and his past.","To those saying its ""a masterpiece"": It's not. There's nothing in this movie we haven't seen before and that's ok. In its context and with the background this is a solid sendoff for Jesse with some amazing moments and some good fanservice (maybe 1¬∞ too much for my taste).It was not as good as I hoped it would be, but it's certainly a good movie and I'm happy this hasn't gone wrong.Not sure if Vince is planning on doing some more of these, but I'd be down."
The Meg,2018,5.7,A rescue mission to the bottom of the ocean is terrorized by a massive prehistoric shark.,"Reviewers say 'The Meg' is an effects-driven shark movie with mixed reception. Positive reviews commend the impressive CGI, thrilling action, and Jason Statham's performance. Fans enjoy the fun, campy elements and self-awareness. However, criticisms target the weak storyline, bland characters, and uneven acting. Some find the dialogue corny and the plot predictable. Despite these flaws, many view it as an enjoyable popcorn flick. The film's humor, tension, and immersive 4DX experience enhance its appeal for certain viewers."
Avengers: Endgame,2019,8.4,"After the devastating events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018), the universe is in ruins. With the help of remaining allies, the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore balance to the universe.","Reviewers say 'Avengers: Endgame' is lauded for its epic conclusion, thrilling action, and emotional depth, successfully wrapping up over a decade of storytelling. Strong character arcs and impressive visuals are highlighted, though some criticize its lengthy runtime and convoluted time travel plot. Character underutilization and reliance on fan service are noted downsides. Despite these issues, many find it a satisfying and resonant finale to the Infinity Saga."
"Ruben Brandt, a gyujto",2018,7.4,"Four expert thieves attempt to steal every famous artwork that is haunting their mutual psychotherapist. A detective attempts to find out who the ""Collector"" is.","This is simply good to see. Pleasant to watch, good to follow the story.
The difference between a typical family movie and this one, is like the difference between only doing cardio training on the treadmill, or doing a crossfit training, which makes your whole body move. However it is not an overcomplicated thriller, you can be immersed in it (in the references and in the eye-catching visual world) as much as you like. However it is a spectacular and new, unique visual experience, it is also familiar and pleasant.
I am very glad that I have seen this movie. Actually, it would have been a huge mistake to miss it.
I would like to see it again tomorrow."
Isn't It Romantic,2019,5.9,A young woman disenchanted with love mysteriously finds herself trapped inside a romantic comedy.,"Funny, Witty, and quite Beguiling ;) My date was hesitant to see ""that type of movie"" however I found him laughing on more than one occasion! I enjoyed it, from the music, to the sets, to the outlandish but loveable to some extent relatable characters! I will definitely be watching this movie again in the near future with the girls! The message at the end was the perfect cherry on top!"
Dumbo,2019,6.2,"A young elephant, whose oversized ears enable him to fly, helps save a struggling circus, but when the circus plans a new venture, Dumbo and his friends discover dark secrets beneath its shiny veneer.",After reading all the terrible reviews for Dumbo my expectations where very low going into the theatre and I came out genuinely surprised. the movie has very many flaws one of them being Nico Parker who plays Millie even though she is very charming her acting is pretty bad especially compared to the rest of the cast who all did a very good job. another flaw for me is the lack of colour almost every single scene has this dark murky texture to it that isn't very appealing. but I did very much enjoy this remake and I honestly don't think its that bad. for the most part the acting is very good especially from Eva Green who for me was the true stand out of the entire movie I found her acting the most believable and impressive. Dumbo is absolutely adorable and steals every single scene he is in and the flying parts of the movie are absolutely gorgeous and magical. the baby mine scene though not as emotional as it was in the animated movie is done beautifully here and it still made me tear up a little bit. the pink elephants on parade scene was absolutely brilliant and in my opinion was one of the better scenes in the entire movie. overall despite all the flaws I really enjoyed Dumbo and would watch it again.
Alita: Battle Angel,2019,7.3,"A deactivated cyborg's revived, but can't remember anything of her past and goes on a quest to find out who she is.","As a longtime fan of Gunnm(Battle Angel Alita), I am satisfied. I appreciate the production team took their time to do the research of the original serials. The adaptation is great, they filtered out few ""acquire taste"" and swapped in elements that would make much more appeal to general public. The film really kept true to the original manga and reassembled almost everything from the manga the scenes, mechanical bodies, characters and the world they lived in. They did a great job on capturing Alita's slightly na√Øve stubbornness, the ""all in or all out"" euthanasic, and the pursuit of who she is.
Storywise, the film ingeniously weaved the first 11 books of manga together, brought up few events that was happening in the 2nd chapter of Alita's adventure to the 1st movie. Which is nice since I bet they're already thinking of the next Alita movie. But as few of Cameron's work, the dark side and the ugliness of irontown wasn't rendered enough. The lack of depth on the ugliness made the whole plot a bit light, the emotional conflict wasn't intense enough and the romance plotline which is very important in the 1st chapter a little bit lack of depth.
The overall CG is stunning. Other than the wanted flyer and the parasite's face the rest of CG is absolute marvelous.
All in all, definite a great Gunnm movie, will definite watch it again and again till the sequel is out!!!"
I Am Mother,2019,6.7,"In the wake of humanity's extinction, a teenage girl is raised by a robot designed to repopulate the earth. But their unique bond is threatened when an inexplicable stranger arrives with alarming news.","Good little sci-fi movie that kept my attention during the entire movie. I Am Mother is the perfect example that you can make an entertaining sci-fi without having a huge budget. The cast is very small, basically it's just two actresses (Clara Rugaard and Hilary Swank) and another (Rose Byrne) for the voice of Mother, but it's all it needed to make it interesting. They all did a good job playing their respective characters. It's the kind of stories I enjoy, post apocalyptic ambiance, robots and/or artificial intelligence taking over. It's all well done, intriguing enough to stand out from the rest, much better than some high budget science fiction movies. I can't see much people disliking this movie, not if you are into this genre."
Knives Out,2019,7.9,"When renowned crime novelist Harlan Thrombey is found dead at his estate just after his 85th birthday, the inquisitive and debonair Detective Benoit Blanc is mysteriously enlisted to investigate.","As a fan of mysteries (Sherlock Holmes, Poirot, Columbo, Monk, Psych.etc.) I was thrilled to see someone making a classic style whodunnit...and the cast! Figure you can't go wrong. Well I enjoyed it & while the cast all have time to shine it is Daniel Craig with his Southern drawl & especially Ana de Armas that steal the show. For anyone keeping away because they hated The Last Jedi...I agree, it was my least favourite of all the Star Wars films, but this is a well written film that was well acted and I can only hope this will inspire others to reinvigorate the murder mystery genre."
You,,7.6,He's the perfect man - until his love becomes the most dangerous thing in your life.,"Reviewers say 'You' is lauded for its suspenseful plot and psychological intrigue, especially in the first two seasons. The show's exploration of obsession and love is often highlighted. However, later seasons face criticism for becoming convoluted and politically charged, with some finding the deviation from the original premise disappointing. Character development and plot consistency are points of contention. Despite mixed reviews, Penn Badgley's performance remains a consistent highlight."
Chernobyl,,9.3,"In April 1986, the city of Chernobyl in the Soviet Union suffers one of the worst nuclear disasters in the history of mankind. Consequently, many heroes put their lives on the line in the following days, weeks and months.","Reviewers say 'Chernobyl' is acclaimed for its gripping narrative, exceptional acting, and detailed recreation of the 1980s Soviet Union. Jared Harris, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, and Emily Watson are lauded for their performances. The series effectively conveys the horror and complexity of the Chernobyl disaster, highlighting human stories. However, some critics note inaccuracies, exaggerations, and creative liberties. Debates arise over the portrayal of the Soviet government and people, seen as overly negative and stereotypical. The use of English accents is also criticized for reducing authenticity. Despite these issues, many reviewers consider 'Chernobyl' a must-watch for its emotional impact and significant message."
X-Men: Dark Phoenix,2019,5.7,"Jean Grey begins to develop incredible powers that corrupt and turn her into a Dark Phoenix, causing the X-Men to have to decide if her life is worth more than all of humanity.","Reviewers say 'X-Men: Dark Phoenix' received mixed reactions, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. Many praised the visual effects, action sequences, and performances, particularly from Sophie Turner, James McAvoy, and Michael Fassbender. However, criticisms included a rushed storyline, lack of character development, and inconsistent tone. Some felt the film failed to capitalize on the rich source material and iconic storyline. Despite these issues, some found it enjoyable and a decent conclusion to the Fox X-Men series."
La belle √©poque,2019,7.4,"Victor, a disillusioned 60-something whose marriage is on the rocks, opts to relive the week of his life when, 40 years earlier, he met his true love through a company that allows customers to return to the time period of their choosing.","This film results in a story about love and nostalgia.The story of this film captures you completely, the plot is very emotional and shows us how true love endures even if there are ups and downs along the way. The story is very beautiful, you manage to empathize with the protagonist from the beginning, it has a very effective balance between comedy and drama, there is a good development of why things happen, it exposes that changes in our life are inevitable but we will always be faithful to those who we are, and what we love, the production design is good, the cinematography is beautiful, and the character development is good. But there is a character who does not have any development just as there is another character who ends up being despicable and gives a very bad example of what it means to love someone.The story is entertaining and emotional, it talks about the fact that the love we have for another person endures and will not cease to exist despite the difficulties along the way, it is a quality film that definitely made me believe in love."
Starter for 10,2006,6.7,"Set in 1985, working-class student Brian Jackson (McAvoy) navigates his first year at Bristol University.","Tom Hanks knows what he's doing when he puts his ha'penny's worth in as an executive producer - this has had sleeper hit written all over it from day one.Lovingly made, with a nicely observed, but still sweet, story of social and socialist morals in the Eighties, it is evocative and rings (mostly) true. The performances are solid, the director gets the era right; but, and here it scores great points: it also has some real soul, and though in places an exercise in capturing its time it has a real wit, and intelligence as well as deprecating humour that serve it well.Funny, intelligent, and definitely deeply romantic - it is also an amazing nostalgia trip for those of us who were around in Britain at that time. The production design has obviously been at great odds to make this work; from the posters in the student bedsit to the clothing it is very well thought through. Aided by a very competent script, that is just too worked through and lacks some real teeth to be really outstanding - it is much better than most American romantic comedies as it is so much more than boy meets (two) girls (and well you know the rest)...it actually touches a much wider world, and questions some values that are worth remembering. Moreover, even at its most manipulative it still somehow has real heart, and just carries you along.It would have been great to have balanced the many laughs with some more complex dilemmas - but this is a surprisingly rounded comedy - a definite must for those who remember Britain in 1985 - without bashing at the politics endlessly - but it is just as enjoyable as a great romantic drama-comedy in its right... the Wedding Singer with much bigger brains...Overall, impressive for its evocation of a lost age - before brands and spending took over the world - and it is guaranteed to make you grin - especially if you were there - and to sing - along. The theme of University Challenge alone will reduce a whole generation to wobbly nostalgic has beens. Excellent stuff, and one to be simply enjoyed."
You Again,2010,5.8,"When a young woman realizes her brother is about to marry the girl who bullied her in high school, she sets out to expose the fianc√©e's true colors.","""You Again"" was somewhat of a nice surprise. I had expected it to be a mediocre comedy, but it turned out to be quite nice.The story told in the movie is very captivating and you easily get yourself immersed into the situation, the characters and the story itself. The story is quite funny as well, you have Marni, who was bullied by Joanna during high school, and now years later, Joanna is about to marry Marni's brother, Will. Apparently Joanna doesn't remember Marni from school, but then things take a drastic change and things escalate...The people acting in ""You Again"" were doing a good job, and they had managed to put together a really nice ensemble of people to fill out the roles. Kristen Bell, playing Marni, was doing a really good job in the movie. But of course, actresses like Sigourney Weaver and Jamie Lee Curtis also always do a nice job, and they were great in their roles. Furthermore, there were some other nice names on the list, such as Betty White, Victor Garber, and so on.Throughout the movie, as the story progressed, there were more and more hilarious scenes, and they worked well. The movie had enough comedy and drama in it to be interesting, not really falling into a teenage comedy genre, which I had expected it to be.""You Again"" is a good choice if you are in for an evening with funny movies, because it is not just a comedy movie, it also has a deeper and nice storyline, not just intending to make you laugh."
Aladdin,,7.3,"Aladdin, the clever hero of Agrabah, continues his adventures with the help of his fiancee Princess Jasmine, his pet monkey Abu, Magic Carpet, Iago the greedy parrot, and of course his best friend the semi-cosmic Genie.","""Aladdin"" was one of my favorite T.V. shows when I was little.  I was 6 years old when it premiered and I remember waking up early Saturday mornings with my sister to watch this show along with ""The Little Mermaid"" T.V. series.  I loved this show and I loved the movie.I especially loved the theme song of this show and my favorite character was Abu, he was so cute.  My sister's favorite character was Jasmine.  I also liked the magic carpet and I used to wish I had one of my own.  My favorite episode was ""The Secret of Dagger Rock"".Overall I really enjoyed this show when I was little and I still enjoy it now whenever I get a chance to watch it.  I give this show 9/10 stars."
Vir√°gv√∂lgy,2018,5.8,Bianka (20) is walking around the suburb without any purpose. From a sudden idea she steals a baby then look for a father and a home. Her ex-boyfriends send her away so finally the mentally disabled Laci (21) helps her who lives in a workers' hostel. For Bianka this situation is just an exciting role play but Laci starts to love her and the baby and he could do anythi...Read all,"Laci scores 53% in some kind of intelligence test, which means that he stays in the guardianship of his uncle. He is rather disappointed; not because of the guardianship, but because he would have liked to achieve 70%.Bianka is very bright, but would probably score way below 53% in any kind of emotional intelligence test. Being bored, she decides to kidnap a ~2-month old baby; having nowhere to go, she gets him involved, and so their weird journey begins.There are many things you may like about this movie. Most of the cast consists of amateur actors (including the two leads), and they do a great job. Most of them play characters that are probably quite close to what and who they are in real life, but they do it in a very natural and authentic way. The guys in some of the minor roles (like Laci's roommate in the workers' dormitory) are great. The scenes shot in the grey outskirts of Budapest (in pubs, the workers' dormitory, construction sites etc.), are both funny and realistic. Many lines are also quite funny; I laughed a lot despite the fact that the movie is rather melancholic. The melancholy is also an element that I personally really liked in it, although it can be frustrating for others. The camerawork is excellent.These kind of stories, they never end well; and you know it in the beginning. Although most of us are not borderline personalities, and we definitely don't kidnap 2-month old babies, our pursuit of happiness is just as pointless and illusionary, as the actions of the protagonists. I guess this is the final point of the movie, but it doesn't end on an entirely low note. She meets someone whom she doesn't always feel the urge to dump lies on; and he gets to make some pretty mature decisions. It's not bad from someone who was officially declared incapable of making decisions and acting in his own interests."
Aladdin,2019,6.9,"Aladdin, a kind thief, woos Jasmine, the princess of Agrabah, with the help of Genie. When Jafar, the grand vizier, tries to usurp the king, Jasmine, Aladdin and Genie must stop him from succeeding.","Reviewers say 'Aladdin' (2019) offers mixed reactions, with praise for Will Smith's Genie and Naomi Scott's Jasmine. The film's vibrant visuals, costumes, and set designs are celebrated. However, criticisms arise for not matching the original's magic, unconvincing CGI, and Marwan Kenzari's Jafar. Changes to songs and characters receive mixed feedback. Despite entertainment value, it struggles to replicate the 1992 classic's charm."
K√∂lcs√∂nlak√°s,2019,3.9,"In this comedy of sexy errors no one wants what he/she should want, no one does what he/she should want: everybody lies, cheats, blunders and fakes something. Love is just the beginning. Desire comes next. And out of desire: a group of lovebirds are all going for the same cosy nest on the same night, packed with surprises, lies and new found loves.","I think this movie deserves a better score than its current 3.9.Yes it's a bit slow and it could use more background music.But I laughed myself to tears towards the end - and unfortunately that rarely happens watching most of today's comedy films.All in all it's totally watchable. It could be better, yes. But the characters are likeable and the finale plays out well. It's worth a viewing."
The Way We Were,1973,7.0,"During post-WWII McCarthyism, a diametrically opposed couple come together only to find out that genuine friendship and physical attraction is not enough to overcome fundamental societal beliefs.","It's WWII. Katie Morosky (Barbra Streisand) is a Jewish girl working in New York radio pumping out patriotic programming among her many activist jobs. In a nightclub, she runs into former crush and Naval officer Hubbell Gardiner (Robert Redford). In college, she was a communist student leader struggling to rally against Franco with Frankie McVeigh (James Woods). He was the WASP star athlete, the man around campus, and outwardly lived a carefree life. He's taken with her tenacity and she admires his writing. In the post war years, they are married in Hollywood where he writes for the studio and she fights against Mcarthyism.She has the better part. He's playing the trophy wife. His hemming and hawing with his writing is a bit infuriating. He's too cool for school except for a few emotional outbursts. Those are great for showing some depth in his character although the couple seems to have only two polar opposite gears. As for her, Streisand gives it her all. There is a grating edge to her character which is not that appealing. I do like that these two flawed characters struggle with their undeniable connection until I can't take their unending fight about politics. Another issue is the unchanging Grecian God beauty of Redford's look. This movie takes place over decades. He needs to change. Maybe give him a buzz cut during the war years. There is the famous song which I wouldn't diss or praise. Pollack delivers a solid melodrama although the relationship gets too melodramatic at times."
Gloria Bell,2018,6.3,A free-spirited woman in her 50s seeks out love at L.A. dance clubs.,"The movie will appeal to an adult, mature audience, and to sensitive souls. A glossy, visually stunning portrait of solitude and the many obstacles to true bonding and communication. Ms Moore is fantastic as usual, mesmerizing and gorgeous. There is subtle beauty everywhere - lights and photography, camera angles, screenplay lines, superb acting. Great songs add to a very rewarding experience."
Swamp Thing,,7.3,"Abby Arcane returns home to Marais, Louisiana to investigate a deadly swamp-borne virus, only to discover the dark, terrifying mysteries of the swamp.",I do not understand why DC cancelled this show. It is quite awesome.
Paper Man,2009,6.5,A washed-up writer forms an unlikely friendship with a teenager from Long Island.,"No matter your sex or what is your age difference, when you find a friend, if it is sincere, you have found one.A one you can cherish, take care of, and don't listen to others prohibiting you of, because of rules and rules.Hat's off to Writers, Directors, Jeff Daniels and Emma Stone. Emma, please give your DNA to a sort of preservation bank, perhaps we or our kids get a chance of having your clone as a friend or more if it worked out ;)A small movie like this, playing with your imagination, emotions and feelings, up to this level? This must be either a proof to talents or something just ran off the normal Hollywood's crap line of production accidentally! /sWant to witness real talent, feeling yourself in their place? Then this is your chance to appreciate a rare feel good movie, so real, you think you are Richard Dunn. (obviously I'm a male!)I'm still looking back at the cupboard waiting the fantastic Ryan Reynolds as Captain Excellent to jump out of it!I wish one day I could find a friend like Abby, giving some sense to my life.Thank you for such a movie. These are the ones we support with our pockets not those 200 Gazillion Dollar ones targeted only for money and as empty as the popcorn box or the cola bottle at the end.Open a bottle of wine, and taste this movie with, preferably a Friend.Cheers!"
Avenue 5,,6.7,"The troubled crew of Avenue 5, a space cruise ship filled with spoiled, rich, snotty space tourists, must try and keep everyone calm after their ship gets thrown off course into space and ends up needing three years to return to Earth.","This type of comedy is not readily accessible to everyone. It only pretends to be lighthearted. I think this is the reason why it has a low rating and polarized reviews.The show is about a space cruise-ship that faces an ever-increasing cascade of errors and unfortunate events. The decisions and reactions from crew and passengers seem almost preposterous, but strangely plausible.The absurdity of some situations makes you laugh, while making you think about what you are actually laughing about. The stark and serious soundtrack highlights this feeling, especially during the credits roll."
The Loudest Voice,,7.9,"The past decade on the life of Roger Ailes, the founder of Fox News, in which Ailes arguably became the Republican party's de facto leader and was accused of sexual harassment, which brought his Fox News reign to an end.","Crowe delivered a career best since gladiator.the performance is so nuanced you feel every breath he takes a masterful writing and supporting cast at best.
this is how a character study is done without being prejudiced towards anything it shows a way for all the others.
Kudos"
Five Feet Apart,2019,7.2,"Stella spends most of her time in the hospital as a cystic fibrosis patient. Her life is full of routines, boundaries and self-control -- all of which get put to the test when she meets Will, a charming boy who has the same illness.","Teenage romance movies always hold special places in a lot of people's hearts, but depending on the decade your familiar with, the elements and presentation are a little different. Eighties brought comedy with emotional drama, nineties was the Nicholas Sparks beginning with the cute, cheesy tactics, early 2000s were all about the Nicholas Sparks, super dramatic stories that hold a lot of places in the hearts of the public. Then came the 2010s and the twist was now romance, but put some type of terminal illness with it to sweeten the deal... So tonight's movie continues this current trend, taking another story in hopes of invoking tears and pulling the heart strings of the audience at the same time. Yes, tonight is Five Feet Apart and yours truly is here to write his reviews as always and share his opinions. Let's go:Movie: Five Feet Apart (2019)Director:

Nice SurprisesSUMMARY: The latest movie fills the formula of sad, drama meeting the romantic teenage plotlines. Fortunately, the acting is there to bring a fantastic dynamic to latch onto in the form of Cole Sprouse and Harley Lu Richardson. Their chemistry is amazing, bringing the two sides of the romantic cone to life in a very sweet, charming, and surprisingly realistic way. Five Feet Apart takes these characters and does a fantastic job advancing them past the carbon copy templates most of these films do. The supporting cast does a wonderful job of being integrated into the story, their own tales and dynamics meshing well to bring out the main characters in new ways.
Of course the movie somehow manages to add on to the simple romantic story by appreciating other dynamics that can be included in romance movies. The comedy is simple and classy, fitting very well with the tone of the movie without being too forced. For those enjoying symbology in the visual arts, the rooms and works of our proverbial Romeo and Juliet have plenty of artistic bite that is quite impressive to behold, instigating a little jealously in my mind about their artwork.
As for the romance component itself, again I give them props for finding a way to bring love and beauty into a realistic way that was both poetic and fun to behold. Five Feet Apart takes most of the cheese factor out of the romance, and instead makes it an adventure that is fun to go on. The ordeal of the disease contending with the blossoming love is a driving force of the film and somehow manages to be fresh despite how plotted love tales are. Perhaps it is also the surprises that come in at points that assists with keeping the adventure going, finding ways to divert from the film, without going too far away from the tale at hand. With all these components it works very well for me.DISLIKES:Predictable
Cheesy At Times
Scientific Stretches
The Parent Components?SUMMARY: No surprise, the movie follows much of the same formula, and my friend and I were able to predict much of the movie based on the trailers we had seen. Fortunately, surprises were able to help with this, but they still held some trouble keeping the romantic movie cheese fest from happening. Five Feet Apart leaves much of the mushy, gushy, Nicholas Sparks like drama that is difficult to get away from, which is a selling point for most going to these movies, but for me could have used a little more spice up.
In addition, some of the scientific plausibility for one with my mindset are difficult to get over in terms of the miracles vs. the statistical chances of the real life. Some of the interactions, primarily in the ending occurring the way it did, was very unrealistic and seeing these miracle moments only added to the cheesy coincidences that this series is famous for. If that's not something that bothers you, no worries on this, but for me this is just something to warrant on. As for the parents, they were okay, but I felt that for something as intense as the themes in this movie, some more involvement would be seen. Five Feet Apart's weakest characters are actually the parents, reduced to a few lines of dialogue and the background images. Sure, it's not about them, but in the other films similar to this, the parents were very active in the support of the kids. What happened here?The VERDICT:Overall, Five Feet Apart was much better than I had anticipated, with a lot more heart, artistic beauty, and adventure than many of the romance/dramas that I've seen. A strong cast, character usage, and surprises in terms of comedy and plot were the selling points for this reviewer in regards to this film. It still has predictability and cheese factors, primarily in the scientific stretches, but the good far outweighs the bad for me in regards to this category of movies. I think this is one for the theater in regards to dramas. If not check this one out for a rent/stream because it's got the heart that movies are known to have.My scores are:Drama/Romance: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0"
The Four Feathers,2002,6.5,A young British officer resigns his commission just before his regiment is sent to battle and soon receives four white feathers from his friends and fiancee as symbols of what they view as his cowardice.,"I felt the need to comment since I saw a lot of pretentious comments attempting to be the next Roger Ebert. If you go into this without comparing it to earlier adaptations and don't self righteously dwell so deeply on the supposed glorification of imperialism then you'll most likely enjoy this film.It's well acted and has the staples of a classic a story; love, betrayal, heroism & honor. I watch A LOT of films and am quite critical of many films that I watch, but for the life of me I cannot understand how people could score this film at 1,2, or 3! Just relax & enjoy an entertaining piece of cinema!"
Miracle Workers,,7.1,"An anthology series in which a colorful blend of outcasts and iconoclasts confront universal issues across various time periods: love, faith, societal norms, and venturing into the unknown.","It's lighthearted, hilarious and it's fun watching. I loved watching this show the episodes are on the smaller side and none of the episodes are boring. I started watching this only only because of Daniel Radcliffe but after the end of the first episode I loved every single character in Heaven Inc. The only complaint I have from the show is that the characters on earth just weren't that interesting for the most part."
The Finest Hours,2016,6.7,The Coast Guard makes a daring rescue attempt off the coast of Cape Cod after a pair of oil tankers are destroyed during a blizzard in 1952.,"""The Finest Hours"" (2016 release; 117 min.) brings the telling, ""based on a true story"" we are reminded, of a daring rescue attempt at sea. As the movie opens, it is ""Wellfleet, MA, November 1951"", and we get to know two Coast Guarders who are out on a double date. Bernie (played by Chris Pine) is immediately smitten by Miriam *played by Holiday Grainger). The movie then shifts to February 17, 1952, where Bernie and Miriam are attending a party, and they decide to get married in April. Later that night, as a nor'easter is bearing down, the Pendleton tanker is in serious trouble, and before we know it, Bernie is ordered to assemble a crew and go out to find any survivors of the Pendleton. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is a big budget movie from Disney Studios, directed by Craig Gillespie (""Lars and The Real Girl""; ""Million Dollar Arm""). If you have seen the movie's trailer (which as been inescapable in the theaters in recent weeks), you know exactly what you are in for: a bigger-than-life, against-all-odds rescue attempt of the crew of the Pendleton tanker, which has split in two, by a four man crew of the Coast Guard in Chatham, MA. Don't ask me how the Pendleton's remaining half tanker doesn't sink! I think it has something to do with the boat's balancing tanks, but in the end it doesn't matter, as we are here to witness some of the wildest open sea disaster scenes you'll ever see. In a sense, this reminds of ""Titanic"", except that the action scenes are pumped up and on steroids. Chris Pine (as Bernie) and Casey Affleck (as the Pendleton's main guy) are fine, but to be honest, they and the rest of the gang are all second fiddle to the special effects. I know that it's all CGI, yet it looks so darn realistic! The movie has a great orchestral score, courtesy of veteran composer Carter Burwell (his score for ""Carol"" received an Oscar nomination). Also make sure to stay through the movie's end titles, as we then get a bunch of period pictures from the Boston Globe and other news sources with the real life people from the events (and likely the source of the costuming for the film). Last but not least, this is released both in 2D and 3D, but just know that the movie was shot in 2D and then converted into 3D (I saw it in 2D). Bottom line: ""The Finest Hours"" is a good ol' fashioned disaster-and-rescue drama that is much better than the ""experts"" would have you believe.""The Finest Hours"" opened nationally this weekend, and the Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but not great. somewhat to my surprise. Regardless, if you are in the mood for an effects-heavy but very realistic disaster-and-rescue movie, I encourage you to check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray (although a movie of this kind just begs to be seen on the big screen). ""The Finest Hours"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
Gone Baby Gone,2007,7.6,"Two Boston area detectives investigate a little girl's kidnapping, which ultimately turns into a crisis both professionally and personally.","Ben Affleck's impressive directorial debut features some remarkably naturalistic performances, a genuine sense of locale, and an atmosphere of despair and hopelessness that becomes a major antagonist. An honestly downbeat film, it portrays a mode of existence where nothing is black or white, and it is that gray area that the film explores so effectively even if I find the story from Dennis Leheane's novel to be a bit far-fetched and convoluted. More than The Departed, Mystic River, and Peter Yates' The Friends of Eddie Coyle, Gone, Baby, Gone understands the inter-relationship among cops, criminals, and a neighborhood as they search for a missing child. Though the boyish Casey Affleck is arguably miscast as Patrick, a character who was more mature in the novel, his performance cannot be faulted and by the end he has won us over. The last scene is particularly resonant. Though well-known actors such as Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman are expectedly good, it is the performances of an unknown supporting cast that gives the film a disturbing authenticity. And Amy Ryan as the child's mother gives a trenchant performance. Director Affleck maintains an admirable tone of objectivity and compassion throughout, and he has made a film that is worthy of your time. Go!Baby!Go!"
J. Edgar,2011,6.5,"J. Edgar Hoover, powerful head of the F.B.I. for nearly fifty years, looks back on his professional and personal life.","J. Edgar (2011)This is a particular kind of movie--the based on fact biopic--done with great attention to period accuracy. If that's what's important, getting a bit of American history into a vivid big screen format, then this works pretty well. On top of that, Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent, very professional.But ""J. Edgar"" not a terrific movie. If a movie is meant to be gripping and moving and beautiful and fun and all those things, this is none of those. It isn't boring or tepid or clumsy or insulting--but not being those things isn't exactly a compliment.And the reasons for this are clear. Mainly there's the format. Between Dustin Black and Clint Eastwood a decision was made to ""tell"" the story by means of the character, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, literally telling the story to a typist. This is a dry and painful way of any kind of drama. It's even a boring way to teach a class, and sometimes you get the feeling we're being ""taught"" things about our history we need to know.Be careful, if you watch only half the movie, you'll be filled with misconceptions that the movie itself corrects, in the last few moments during a final important conversation. That problem of course is a new kind of ""unreliable narrator,"" since the story is being told by the protagonist himself. And no one is very honest, truly, in an autobiography. In a way that makes the movie the most interesting it can be. I'm also not sure what the director and writer really feel about Hoover's sexual orientation, at least as it applied to his doing his job.There are some familiar Eastwood slants on content that might irk a few of you familiar with his politics. For example, he makes very public his appreciation for civil rights and equality, but in a way that's so showy you begin to suspect the motivation (that he believes what he preaches but he also wants you to like him for it). But then he also has little to say about the heavy handed FBI (and pre-FBI) days when lots of innocent people got followed and railroaded and jailed and worse. The mood is set that in those old days things were different and we really needed a megalomaniac at the FBI to keep this darned country safe from the Commies. Something like that.As a drama, which is maybe the secondary consideration, the plot moves between a present day 1960s crisis (between the Kennedy and Nixon years) and the early days. It flips back and forth a lot (too much for me) and keeps DiCaprio's narration flowing right through a lot of it in part to hold it together. The result is fragmented as a story, and stilted as a dramatic flow.Just a heads up on the format and the flow. Again, if it's content you want, and you can enjoy the way it gets cobbled together, there's a lot of stuff here to sort out."
Rocketman,2019,7.3,"The musical fantasy about Elton John's breakthrough years, from his time as a prodigy at the Royal Academy of Music through his influential and enduring musical partnership with Bernie Taupin.","I have been waiting for weeks to the premier and Taron's performance blowed me away. I can't tell it was going for a movie about Elton John or going to a premier of a concert where Taron singing and performing and telling his life story from the screen (or from the stage cause it's a premier). His voice is precious, is emotional and is skillful. He got that powerful voice yet that soulful and soft that I am sure that he is the right person, the PERFECT person for those songs and for this film. Such a perfect actor, with a gifted voice.
His acting was outstanding and his eyes told things. I can felt his thoughts and feelings, his sadness, disapointment, his emptyness. Just, breathtaking.
And Jamie Bell did great, Richard Madden also, such a wonderful compilation of these three talented and professional actors.
Love their charisma and their chemistry together. Thank you very much for a great movie. Really enjoyed it."
The Edge of Seventeen,2016,7.3,"High-school life gets even more unbearable for Nadine when her best friend, Krista, starts dating her older brother.","""The Edge of Seventeen"" (2016 release; 104 min.) brings the story of Nadine, a 17 yr. old junior at Lakewood HS. As the movie opens, Nadine is racing the school's hallways to meet with her favorite teacher and tell him ""I'm going to kill myself!"" The movie then goes back in time to see how we get to this point. After a short look at ""Nadine, Age 7"" and ""Nadine, age 13"", where we learn how socially awkward things are for Nadine, but for her strong friendship with her BFF Krista. That brings us to ""Nadine, 17"". At this point we're less than 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is the directing debut for writer Kelly Fremon Craig (who wrote 2009's ""Post Grad""). Here, Craig takes another shot at bringing the social awkwardness of being in high school and trying to survive all of the pressures that come with it. When was the last time that I've seen such an awkward teenager, who blurts out ""I'm seeing myself and I can't stand it. I gotta spend the rest of my life with myself!"". So nothing original here as such, except of course that Nadine is played by none other than Hailee Steinfeld, yes the little girl who was nominated of an Oscar in 2010 for ""True Grit"" is now grown up into a wonderful young lady which bunches of acting talent. Steinfeld basically carries the movie on her back, and is in virtually every single scene. There is some terrific support from Kyra Sedwick as Nadine's mom and Woody Harrelson as Nadine's teacher, but believe me when I say this is all about Hailee Steinfeld. Last but not least, the movie has a TON of great songs in it (check out the soundtrack).""The Edge of Seventeen"" opened nationally this past weekend. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great (about 10 people in the entire theater). This movie has not gotten a big marketing push, and it remains to be seen whether it will benefit from strong word-of-mouth. I quite enjoyed it for what it was, a strong vehicle for leading actress Hailee Steinfeld, even if the territory she explores here has been done before and doesn't offer all that much new. If you get a chance to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, I'd suggest you do and draw your own conclusion."
Hearts in Atlantis,2001,6.9,A young boy's life changes for the better when a mysterious man with psychic powers moves into the family home that he shares with his widowed mother.,"One of the many acting skills Anthony Hopkins possesses is the ability to attract and disturb at the same time; he can charm you to no end with sly smiles and unspoken allure. But all the while he's hiding something unsettling that you can't ever quite figure out. In Hearts in Atlantis, the latest of what by now must be a truly massive box set of Stephen King film adaptations, Sir Anthony finds a writer perfectly suited to these unique talents. What we see is a movie eerie and enchanting, both in mood and in style -- a story that holds onto its cards throughout, letting you see each of them slowly, one by one, and only when absolutely necessary. In the end we find we have been held captive by a stunningly memorable and powerful film.The story begins as a retrospective: Robert Morse plays the older version of Bobby Garfield, the central character of this reminiscent story. It takes a recent tragedy to send the older Bobby unwittingly in the mind to his days as an 11-year-old in 1960. There we go to a place common to almost all of King's stories: rural New England, where Bobby lives with his mother (Hope Davis), and spends his innocent, aimless days with his two friends Sully (Will Rothhaar) and Carol (Mika Boorem). His father died when Bobby was only five, and his mother is so busy hopefully tending to a real estate career that she has little time to tend to her only child. To this point nothing is out of the ordinary; this childhood is deliberately portrayed with hazy, warm undertones, akin to the sense of youth so familiar to many who look back upon it.Fairly early on we meet Ted Brautigan (Hopkins), a boarder who shows up quite suddenly on their porch, his belongings in grocery bags. He is clean, well-spoken, unobtrusive and generally a placid sort. But he is also an instant enigma: he is of unknown origin, means, and intent, and Bobby's mother quickly decides this is a man to be viewed with caution. Bobby, on the other hand, innocently curious --and most likely desperate for anything that could spell the boredom of his uneventful summer-- decides this a man worth knowing. They become close, Brautigan dispersing kennels of wisdom and even offering young Bobby a dollar a week and cold root beers to read him the newspaper daily. But Brautigan clearly has a special quality about him: he can sense things and see things that are not readily apparent to most others. Bobby seems to have this gift as well, though in a lees pronounced way, and through this they form a bond, one Bobby's mother slowly and begrudgingly affords him. She's suspicious of this man still, while we the viewers begin gradually to glean some of the mysteries of his past. I don't dare say what they are, but they do involve ""the Low Men"", people, Brautigan warns Bobby, who may some day come looking for him. He tells Bobby what signs to look for about town, gently using the boy as a scout of imminent danger. Bobby does not know who they are or what they represent. Neither do we, for a long time, but the key instrument of this story is to make it intentionally vague. We are not to be concerned about these details, but rather to know that Brautigan has experienced them, and will do whatever he can to shield Bobby and his youth from the corrupting darkness looming behind them.Stephen King has been widely read as an author of horror and suspense, but his best works --like this one-- work on a much more insidious level, evoking a sense of foreboding and unknown that manages to inform everything that happens within. The makers of this film find great success emphasizing the shady murkiness of the story, and they still manage to keep things centered. The mysteries of Ted Brautigan find parallels in the wonders of youth: Bobby experiences his first kiss, naturally, encounters a menacing bully, and learns to view his mother in evolving ways...grown-up ways. This is really a story of innocence and maturity, of youth's purity and the dangers that lurk at its end. Bobby finds that end to a certain degree, but along the way finds friendship, knowledge, and a sense of the mysteries of adulthood that await him. Ted Brautigan is really more than a friend to Bobby; he is a guide, a protector, and a teacher. These two actors provide real, natural on screen chemistry in this film, and there is one delightful scene early on where Brautigan intensely relives for Bobby a glory day of Chicago Bears football lore. This is an actor who can take any available strengths of writing and magnify them for us viewers who watch him say them aloud. As a result Anthony Hopkins anchors this infectious little film to the ground while still allowing it to soar skyward when needed."
Men in Black: International,2019,5.6,The MIB tackle a mole in their organization.,I like funny movies with action and the this had both. Didn't really care what I thought it should be or how it needed to one up the last movie. I just enjoyed it
Doom Patrol,,7.7,The adventures of an idealistic mad scientist and his field team of superpowered outcasts.,"Reviewers say 'Doom Patrol' is acclaimed for its unconventional superhero narrative, emphasizing character arcs and personal growth. It delves into trauma, redemption, and heroism's complexities. The cast, especially Brendan Fraser and Diane Guerrero, delivers remarkable performances. The show blends humor with emotional resonance, addressing social and political issues. Critics applaud its creative storytelling and dark comedy. However, some find the pacing slow and the plot disorganized, indicating it may not suit every audience."
Drunk Parents,2019,4.0,Two drunk parents attempt to hide their ever increasing financial difficulties from their daughter and social circle through elaborate neighborhood schemes.,"Funny and silly, I forgot the stress of the real world for the duration of the movie. Sure, it won't win Oscars but sometimes you need a distraction that doesn't require you to think too deeply."
La haine,1995,8.1,24 hours in the lives of three young men in the French suburbs the day after a violent riot.,"Reviewers say 'La Haine' is celebrated for its raw depiction of social issues in Parisian suburbs, tackling themes like racism and police brutality. Its black-and-white cinematography and intense performances, especially by Vincent Cassel, are highly praised. The film's bold narrative and social relevance resonate strongly, though some critics find the plot lacking direction or the characters unconvincing. Despite mixed opinions, 'La Haine' is acknowledged for its powerful commentary and influence on French cinema."
A Star Is Born,2018,7.6,A hard-drinking country music star falls in love with a singer whose career quickly takes off.,"Reviewers say 'A Star Is Born' delivers strong performances, especially from Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, and a compelling soundtrack. The film's exploration of fame, addiction, and the music industry resonates deeply, though some find the story predictable and pacing uneven. The chemistry between the leads is widely appreciated, yet Cooper's direction garners mixed reviews. Despite its flaws, the movie's emotional depth and musical score captivate many viewers, making it an engaging yet imperfect experience."
The Best of Enemies,2019,7.3,"Civil rights activist Ann Atwater faces off against C.P. Ellis, Exalted Cyclops of the Ku Klux Klan, in 1971 Durham, North Carolina over the issue of school integration.","The incredible skill and range of Henson and Rockwell (long one of my favorite actors) is on display here in a story that needed to be told on the world stage (although the book had been out for some twenty years). I'm no SJW, but I'm glad we are getting more of these movies with real life examples of people coming together, especially when their backgrounds and motivations are so well explained. If it helps even a single extremist to change their ways, it was well worth it. For the rest of us it is an apt reminder of how things were not long ago, how much work still remains to be done, and how it CAN be done. Bravo."
De Leeuwenkoning,2019,6.8,"After the murder of his father, a young lion prince flees his kingdom only to learn the true meaning of responsibility and bravery.","You know the song, where ""can you feel the loooooove tonight"", and it looks like the lions are about to bang? Yeah, Beyonce kind of went all over the place with that and it sounded weird.Anyways, visually it was beautiful but characters just lacked emotion, I think this was a deliberate choice but it causes a lack of investment from a viewer's perspective. The cast were hit and miss, if you've seen it then you'll know who was great and who were rubbish.But yeah. At least it's not as bad as the mess that was Aladdin"
Tolkien,2019,6.8,"Tolkien's novels were inspired by his mom's storytelling, falling in love with another orphan, Edith, forming a brotherhood with 3 other misfits at school, the trench war of WWI and later telling stories to his own kids.","Tolkien (3.5 out of 5 stars).Tolkien is a beautifully done biographical drama film about a famous fantasy writer J.R.R. Tolkien who went on to write The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings series. It touched the base when him and his brother lost their mother to some illness. J.R.R. then went to a school where he met a few other teenagers that he did not get along with. Until, eventually they become close friends. There bond grows stronger over the years and they inspire each other to make a difference. He meets Edith (Lily Collins) who he falls in love with. He gets separated when he is drafted into World War 1.The plot is pretty decent for a biographical film about J.R.R. Tolkien. The movie was a bit slow in the second act with Tolkien and his fellowship friends talking about stories. It could have been better handled. The plot is inspirational. Tolkien and his friends no matter how often they fight with each other, they will always be brothers. Tolkien and Edith fall deeply in love until they go on different paths. Years later, they come across each other again.Nicholas Hoult is great as Tolkien. Lily Collins was also good as Edith. The music score by Thomas Newman is beautifully done. The direction delivers the eerie tone during the World War 1 scenes. Tolkien suffering from an illness. And trying to find his friends. When they are attacked. He witnesses most of his man killed in combat. Which he feels like he is isolated and he starts seeing visions of dragons out of flamethrowers. Or the aftermath smoke from the explosions looking like a dark lord Sauron. Which he uses his experience to write a fantasy story. While his one focus theme is the journey that everyone goes too and the experiences they face.Overall, Tolkien is a pretty fair film. The plot is a bit inspirational and emotional with the journey Tolkien experiences. Sadly, the film suffers from an uneven pace in the second act of the movie. The performances and music score is fantastic."
Black Rain,1989,6.6,Two NYC cops arrest a Yakuza member and must escort him when he's extradited to Japan.,"I was searching a review from a Japanese reviewer and found one, very tough with the film. It made me react here.First, I consider myself as neutral as nor American nor Japanese even if I know those two fascinating countries inhabitants a little. And I did not feel the same the Japanese reviewer did. In my sense the film does not mock Japan. It does not show Japan as 'inferior' but as different. And this is all the interest of this film whose purpose in my opinion is to show the opposite mentalities and culture. Both sides are presented. The bad and the good ones.The Bad : Japoneses are showed as ridiculous with red tape and bureaucracy matters, with shy behaviors, weird violence (for occidental people). But Americans too. Those are presented as brutal stupid beasts, for example when Charlie Vincent run after a motorbike without understanding the trap is going into or when Nick Conklin does not manage to restrain himself from knocking everywhere. Or when Nick signs a stupid sheet of paper without distrust. The two Americans are also presented as arrogant as they don't even think that foreigners could speak English .. because they don't imagine it is even possible. Even the American/Japanese prostitute rejects their arrogance. Also American police is presented as corrupted and messy ... So no one wins here I guess.The good : Japaneses are also presented as good. Cops are straight but cooperative and honor respectful, mainly instructed, efficient. Even if they lack of adaptiveness and are bad inspired to reject the American cops help. The mafia is well presented too. Franckly, they really are scary guys but gain respect with their honor code. Sato is impressive.Here I agree with the Japanese reviewer : The Americans are glorified (music helps :). Nick manages on his own (yet with the help of Mas) to solve a difficult case in a country he obviously even doesn't know. This is clearly the weakness of the film.Yet what I really appreciated was the oppositions between Mas and Nick. Wiseness and honor of Mas, for example when he feels insulted by Nicks thief behavior or when he learns from Nick. Humanity and pugnacity of Nick.I also liked mafia's leader speech with Nick. Here we definitively can't say the film only runs for America, obviously.One regret. We definitively see too little of Japan. Even if the film does much in presenting a country that we mainly bad know in occident, it could have done more. That said, I think this was not the purpose of the director who just wanted to focus on mindsets.Another regret : the ridiculous sounds of the motorbikes especially in the beginning of the film and in the last scene.The actors are all perfect. The soundtrack is really cool. Contrarily to the Japanese reviewer, I appreciated the way the director represents Japan, with subtlety, as Japan is all about. And USA with strength, as USA are all about too, sometimes too much :). If the oppositions between the two countries are exaggerated, it is in the purpose of showing them better and make understand, I guess. This is a 'must-be-watched' film for me. One of the best of Ridley Scott."
Spider-Man: Far from Home,2019,7.4,"Peter Parker, the beloved superhero Spider-Man, faces four destructive elemental monsters while on holiday in Europe. Soon, he receives help from Mysterio, a fellow hero with mysterious origins.","Reviewers say 'Spider-Man: Far From Home' garners mixed reviews, highlighting impressive visual effects, thrilling action sequences, and standout performances by Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal. The humor and MCU integration receive applause. However, criticisms point to predictable plot twists, heavy reliance on CGI, and a perceived lack of narrative depth. The teenage drama and romance subplots are deemed less engaging by some. Exposition and plot holes also draw complaints. Despite these issues, many find the film enjoyable and entertaining."
John Wick Chapter 2: Wick-vizzed,,7.8,A candid look at rehearsal footage in support of a focus on pre-viz.,This is a side-film making video so I do not rate this. But it shows us the hard work they've done to make this film. We need to respect Keanu and all the team he worked with. They did a very well done job.
The Skeleton Twins,2014,6.8,"Having both coincidentally cheated death on the same day, estranged twins reunite with the possibility of mending their relationship.","Twins Milo and Maggie have not seen each other for ten years then Maggie gets a call to say her estranged brother is in hospital after a failed suicide attempt.She goes to see him out in L.A. and brings him back to New York. There he gets to confront his past, their joint histories and whatever the future may hold. This is essentially them getting to know each other again after such a long hiatus and in doing so holding up a metaphoric mirror to each other.Now this started out a bit slow but once it picked up it is really engaging. Bill Hader as Milo manages to capture the complexities of some one full of life's disappointment but still with reserves of joy that just need tapping. Kristen Wiig plays his sister who has more layers than an onion in terms of how she juggles her various needs. In other words they are both just really human with the same frailties we all have. This is a comedy but it is somewhat dark and often wry but I still found this to be extremely enjoyable for all that ‚Äì recommended to those who like an offbeat comedy."
Body of Lies,2008,7.0,A CIA agent on the ground in Jordan hunts down a powerful terrorist leader while being caught between the unclear intentions of his American supervisors and Jordan Intelligence.,"The craftsmanship behind director Ridley Scott's 2008 convulsive political thriller is impressive, but having acts of terrorism drive an intentionally labyrinth plot reveals how they impede the story structurally, an insurmountable barrier that screenwriter William Monahan (""The Departed"") can't seem to overcome. The movie's first half is all the more bewildering for all the double-crosses and cover-ups that serve to set up the central situation. Based on Washington Post columnist David Ignatius' 2007 novel, the movie focuses on embedded CIA operative Roger Ferris who is on an undercover assignment to hunt an Al-Qaeda terrorist leader named Al-Saleem. Ferris is not entirely alone as he is connected via cell phone with his stateside boss Ed Hoffman, who is the head of the CIA's Near East division and directs Ferris toward life-threatening tasks in a most nonchalant manner from his upscale suburban home.The plot's impetus is driven by the elusive Al-Saleem's unblinking series of suicide bombings in Europe in response to the invasion by US and UK troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. The movie gets more interesting when Ferris decides to work with Jordanian intelligence director Hani Salaam, an erudite, enigmatic figure who is well entrenched in the Middle East militia and appears to take a page from Mario Puzo's ""The Godfather"" when it comes to loyalty and betrayal. Of course, it's a matter of course that Ferris' loyalty is tested when an elaborate plan is hatched to create a bogus competing terrorist group and use an unwitting Dubai architect as the head. The other complicating factor is that Ferris has fallen for pretty Iranian nurse Aisha when he gets treated for possible rabies at a clinic. It becomes inevitable that she also becomes a pawn in the political intrigue. Scott paints his canvas with a lot of graphic violence from large-scale bombings to more intimate acts of torture.All of the external elements are fitting, but they can't seem to masquerade the convoluted and often clich√©-ridden plot at the film's core. A solid cast goes a long way to compensate for the plot holes. As Ferris, Leonardo DiCaprio applies his trademark wiry energy to an intensely compelling performance that could have shown a bit more variety. Adding fifty belly-stretching pounds to his frame, Russell Crowe, Scott's favorite leading man (""Gladiator"", ""American Gangster"", ""A Good Year""), plays the Arkansan Hoffman as a scene-stealing character part. The irony is that the Australian actor's Southern accent is more convincing than DiCaprio's. Their antagonistic interplay, played out mostly on the phone, is rather predictably developed. Fetching Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani provides gratefully calm relief to the ongoing mayhem as Aisha, although her character comes across as a mere plot device. There is a nicely fractious dinner table scene with Ferris and her judgmental older sister, although the movie plays down the more human-size hostilities in favor of the pyrotechnics.As Hani, Mark Strong (""Sunshine"", ""Stardust"") leaves the most vivid impression of the cast but for the most old-fashioned of cinematic reasons - he plays what could be a villainous figure as a suave, mysterious man of honor who is completely on top of his job, an intentional counterpoint, at least physically, to Crowe's slovenly Hoffman. The film's resolution defies credibility, but it finally becomes clear that Monahan is not interested in exposing the factors that have driven the Middle East political maelstrom into acts of escalating terrorism. Rather, his screenplay shows that testosterone-driven Hollywood-style entertainment can take place anywhere."
The Hustle,2019,5.5,Two con women - one low rent and the other high class - team up to take down the men who have wronged them.,"I had zero expectations and it turned out to be a total laugh-a-thone. There are hilarious moments in the movie that overrun the sometimes flawed or absurd script. Starts mildly slow and it builds up pretty well half way through.
The ladies are very funny, Rebel Wilson is the female Zack Galifianakis!
8/10 and remember to watch the post-post credits scene!"
John Wick 3: Parabellum,2019,7.4,"John Wick is on the run after killing a member of the international assassins' guild, and with a $14 million price tag on his head, he is the target of hit men and women everywhere.","Reviewers say 'John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum' is lauded for its intense action, creative choreography, and Keanu Reeves' performance. The film's world-building and expanded assassin universe receive praise. However, criticisms include a lack of coherent plot, repetitive action, and underdeveloped supporting characters. Some feel the film overemphasizes action at the expense of story and character development. Despite these issues, many find the movie enjoyable for its spectacle and entertainment value."
Pete Davidson: Alive from New York,,6.2,Comedian Pete Davidson's intimate and candid stand-up special shot live in New York City.,"I'm no stranger to dark / f'ed up humour and definitely doesn't offensive or off-putting in that regard, but its the sloppy delivery and awkward pauses that makes this really hard to get through.
It's like he's high (and not the good kind) throughout the show and looses hes train of thought multiple times, he even starts a joke at one point then starts to explain something completely different and never circles back to finish the joke. And I feel bad cus this guy is usually funny and gets too much flak from haters"
Natural Born Killers,1994,7.2,Two victims of traumatized childhoods become lovers and psychopathic serial murderers irresponsibly glorified by the mass media.,"I've nothing against experimental movie-making. But here technique overwhelms everything else, leaving us with cinematic chaos and maybe a headache. All the rapid- fire jump cuts, color changes, and camera angles add up to an anti-movie mess. It looks like somebody's self-indulgence run wild. To me technique should enhance story, not overwhelm it. Or, in some cases, it might get us to see a familiar theme in a new way. But since there's no real story here, just a sequence of chaotic events, there's ironically no real conflict, just a two-hour waste of film and viewer attention. To be fair, I guess there is a message, something about the media creating a faux reality that sucks people into its seductive realm. That's certainly a worthy, if not novel, theme, especially in our fraught day and age. But unfortunately this movie mess overwhelms the idea without either enhancing it or seeing it in a new way. Too bad.(In passing‚ÄîMost folks think of Mallory and Mickey as modern day Bonnie and Clyde. Nevertheless, B&C's main purpose was robbing banks, not killing people, a-la M&M. To me, the apt comparison is with the less well-known, teenagers Charlie Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate. After killing her parents and a baby, their murder spree spread across Nebraska and Wyoming in 1958, and appears motivated by little more than a perverted joy of killing, a-la M&M!)"
Fighting with My Family,2019,7.0,A former wrestler and his family make a living performing at small venues around the country while his kids dream of joining World Wrestling Entertainment.,"Although I'm a casual wrestling fan of over 20 years, I wasn't really planning on seeing this. Paige was a good wrestler, but her life story wasn't something I had any interest in. However, even if a lot of stuff might of been ""enhanced,"" the movie doesn't fail to be entertaining. There's a surprisingly good amount of sharp wit and one-liners without being too screwball and keeping the drama intact. All the cast is great, especially Vince Vaughn as the coach who has to dash the recruits' dreams.But I thought it glossed over too much of what made her special enough to rise in the first place. Sure she had the talent, but if you want to know how she made jump to champion then you're going to be disappointed. So they could've expanded a bit more on that.Overall, it was a fun time and I can give a hearty recommendation even if you don't care for wrestling."
"I, Tonya",2017,7.5,"Competitive ice skater Tonya Harding rises amongst the ranks at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, but her future in the activity is thrown into doubt when her ex-husband intervenes.","I think this film may have had the best trailer of 2017. I saw it and knew instantly how badly I wanted to see it. I've never been a fan of Margot Robbie and her previous acting efforts but this looked like her awakening and where she would be proving me wrong. I believe it, she's quite sensational in this film. Her dedication to her role shows but really everyone involved has done very well. Craig Gillespie has his first real winner with I, Tonya.I, Tonya is a biographical picture about famed and disgraced figure skater, Tonya Harding. Tonya was pushed onto the rink by her abusive mother at a very young age and despite the abuse becomes a very talented ice skater. The cycle of abuse continues with her abusive husband but she tries to bear through and succeed. Everyone seems to be against her but her talent is hard to deny. The film also goes into the famed attack on fellow ice skater Nancy Kerrigan and the aftermath of the incident.The film is sort of told from a mockumentary perspective as if key characters are being interviewed. The film also utilizes breaking the fourth wall where characters in a scene would talk to the audience. I thought this was interesting and separates itself from being a standard biopic and gives this film a real comedic depth. The soundtrack is catchy and literally every performance in this film makes for a very engaging time. I didn't even recognize the chameleon Bobby Cannavale until the credits rolled.Some wonder why the film was made but it kind of helps you identify with Tonya. She suffered physical and psychological abuse from both her foul mouthed mother and her rage filled husband. Her hands may not be completely clean in what happens to Nancy Kerrigan, but she is also just a victim of circumstances. Vastly talented, but just short of reaching her pinnacle due to outside factors and her image and attitude. The film isn't perfect but its vastly entertaining and could be giving Margot Robbie and Allison Janney Oscar nominations. I'm going to let this sink in and I'm sure its going to be something I go back to.7.5/10"
The Nun,2018,5.4,A priest with a haunted past and a novice on the threshold of her final vows are sent by the Vatican to investigate the death of a young nun in Romania and confront a malevolent force in the form of a demonic nun.,"Reviewers say 'The Nun' offers atmospheric tension and creepy moments, praised for its jump scares and connection to 'The Conjuring' universe. Acting and direction receive positive notes, though many criticize its clich√©s, predictability, and lack of originality. Characters are deemed weak, pacing is off, and the story feels stretched. Visual appeal is noted, but overall, it's seen as an average horror film with mixed elements."
Replicas,2018,5.5,A scientist becomes obsessed with bringing back his family members who died in a traffic accident.,This movie is not the best but it's definitely not the worst. If you are a person who enjoys watching movies without criticizing every little detail I think you'll enjoy it. I did laugh at the CGI but the rest of the movie was good. Those that are rating is it low are being really harsh. The only way you will know if you like it is if you give it a try.
Long Shot,2019,6.8,"Journalist, Fred Flarsky, reunites with his childhood crush, Charlotte Field; now one of the most influential women in the world. As she prepares to run for president, Charlotte hires Fred as her speechwriter, and sparks fly.","I actually don't understand all the highly negative reviews. There isn't enough things in the world to laugh about and this comedy is one of them. It wasn't perfect, but it had a reasonable message and definitely had some funny scenes"
Spenser Confidential,2020,6.2,"When two Boston police officers are murdered, ex-cop Spenser teams up with his no-nonsense roommate Hawk to take down criminals.","First off, I enjoyed the movie as a strict action/detective flick. Wahlberg is likeable in just about everything he does. Alan Arkin as Henry Cimoli was perfect. Iliza Schlesinger as Cissy was sexy (those breasts!) and comical. Her standup gets annoying so keeping her screen time to a minimum in this move was a good choice. Winston Duke didn't do much with the character of Hawk other than looking imposing because he was big, not because he oozed menace. Still, it was a fun action movie that moved along at a brisk pace and had lots of great action scenes.However, this version of Spenser has next to nothing to do with the book or TV series character other than his name. I'm not sure I understand why they bothered calling it Spenser if they changed everything about the character. The series ended over 30 years ago so its not its not like it had great name recognition. They could have called it Joe Confidential and it would have had the same impact. Spenser was a renaissance man. He was streeet smart, suave, quoted literature, was a gourmet cook, had a moral code, was loyal to his girlfriend (Susan; a college professor) and was kicked off the force for being a smartass and not blindly following bad rules, and never went to jail. Hawk and he met as young boxers and went their separate ways, one into law enforcement and one into the criminal life. They crossed paths many times, but respected each other, even if it meant squaring off against each other. Its what made their relationship special. Its why I gave the movie a chance, to see if they explored their earlier life together. I guess it did that, but they went for the cheap character development in favor or more smash ups and fist fights. Wahlberg and Duke as roommates at Henry's place was just lame writing. There was so much fertile ground that could have been covered here and they blew it.As I said in the first paragraph, it was an enjoyable movie, but it didn't do anything to distinguish it from every other action film that gets made these days. Spenser is a unique character with such a rich background and that was just ignored for more set pieces."
Blockers,2018,6.2,Three parents try to stop their daughters from losing their virginity on prom night.,"Blockers is a film that I personally looking forward to a bunch. The trailers completely sold me on this idea of a hard R, raunchy comedy that was original, heartfelt, and delivered some dang good laughs too!Unfortunately, all the stuff you heard that was funny in the trailer is either not funny because you've heard it all before or it's cut out of the movie entirely.So don't see Blockers. It's a painfully unfunny crude-fest that delivers crap humor, no emotion, disney-channel acting, and a worthless story. The only good things about it are the three daughters and one of their dates.Giving this one a generous C- or on Imdb, a 5/10"
Zathura: A Space Adventure,2005,6.3,Two young brothers are drawn into an intergalactic adventure when their house is hurled through the depths of space by the magical board game they are playing.,"I remember seeing the previews for ""Zatura: A Space Adventure"" back in 2005 and thinking that the premise for this one is pretty much ""Jumanji""....which it is. While not a sequel, the game clearly is a reworking of the original story. So, if you like one, you'll likely enjoy the other.When the story begins, a divorced dad (Tim Robbins) is trying to work as his bratty kids are being...well...brats. Eventually, after Dad leaves, the youngest finds a game called ""Zathura"" and when he starts playing it, the game becomes real. Suddenly the house is transported to outer space and the only conceivable way to get back is to, apparently, complete the game with his annoying and occasionally hateful brother. In the process, they meet an astronaut, a murderous robot and meat-eating lizard creatures.The visuals in this film are mind-blowing...particularly for 2005. So much CGI was used...and it looks real. In fact, the CGI and stunts are second to none. As for the story, it's decent but has two minor problems--you really hate the three siblings and the story will be less interesting to adults and is too violent and scary for younger kids. Worth seeing with your kids."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,2010,6.1,A protege of the magician Merlin must train his teacher's successor - an introverted but resourceful physics prodigy - in the art of sorcery to prevent the return of Morgana le Fay.,"The same people who to me are surprisingly rudely negative about this film would probably say I'm too easily pleased, but I enjoy movies as escapism for the most part and see no need to pick this very enjoyable vehicle to death. Actually, some early negatives I'd read had me worried that I would be irritated I spent the money, instead I've already decided to buy this when it comes out.Overall, I'd say if you like romping easy movies like The Mummy, National Treasure, and Lake Placid you'll like this, plus refreshingly (without being sickeningly sweet) there is not one swear word or sexed-up scene, so take the older kids and Grandma. I thought Nicolas Cage was excellent, he looked great and can wear a leather duster better than most, and there was some nice chemistry between Cage and Baruchel. Alred Molina looked like he was having fun and is such an enjoyable villain. Baruchel does a good job - he is so geeky at times it is a tad painful - and I found myself rooting for him. The 2 main female characters are lovely and appealing personalities.More pluses: A lively pace and I never lost interest plus a fair number of laughs. Some interesting character twists with the oily young rock-star magician helping Molina, and some very funny cheeky nods to the original animated Fanatasia - watch for the nod to Star Wars. Great and interesting special effects that made sense when they were used. Even the way the actors moved when they were doing magic was very good (for some reason the wand-waving in Harry Potter sometimes reminds me of people using a flyswatter or shaking a bug off a stick, that didn't happen in this film).So no, this isn't some classic of cinema, it is what it is and is a bit thin here and there, but it's also quite good for a ""magical romp"" and is in no way a bad film or a waste of money. I could have done without the occasional background songs which seemed designed to emphasize romantic angst or appeal to young teenagers, but that was bearable. I saw this at an early evening show and there were not many people in the theater, but we all laughed and there was applause at the end, and we left the theater smiling. Personally I think the critics panning this are full of BS or are trying to prove what intellectuals they are. In the meantime see this with your family or take your friends, and then go out and get some ice cream and sit outside and enjoy summer. Hope they make a sequel, too."
Noah,2014,5.8,Noah is chosen by God to undertake a momentous mission before an apocalyptic flood cleanses the world.,"Just watched this on Pay-Per-View having missed a chance to see in theaters (dithered over whether or not to see it due to wildly mixed reviews). It was visually engaging enough to keep me watching till the end but as the credits began to roll, I found myself feeling dissatisfied.Some of the scenery and shots featuring animals were really cool, I found myself wishing for more (that is, more time spent on animals...and a closer look at different species as imagined by the creators of this film).Ray Winstone is a distinguished actor but I found his portrayal at times creepy, at times laughable, overall weak (how much of this was due to direction and/or other factors...not sure, when it comes to this film I didn't get a sense either way). Emma Watson and Jennifer Connelly impressed me, I got a sense of quiet strength from their characters.Russell Crowe, also one of my favorite actors (I thought his Robin Hood was masterful, a fresh new take), disappointed. Without giving anything away, there were some parts of this film that called for a more dramatic narrative...his timing and (at times) rushed speech took away from the grandeur of what was meant to be an epic film. You find yourself wishing he would deliver certain lines a bit more theatrically, like David Wenham in 300 or one of the greats of classic film (Charlton Heston, perhaps).I didn't realize when I started watching that Anthony Hopkins was also in the film. When he popped up on screen I laughed and thought: 'Of course...can't make an epic film without Anthony Hopkins!' Probably just me but it seemed a bit tired as far as casting goes.I might have enjoyed it more on the big screen but don't regret watching at home on my TV. Bottom line, entertaining enough to watch...just a bit of a let-down."
Annihilation,2018,6.8,"A biologist signs up for a dangerous, secret expedition in which the laws of nature don't apply.","I've thought about this film for days after seeing it. I don't even know what specifically I've been thinking about, all I can say is it left a big impression on me. I disagree with those who say it's intellectual. I don't think it is nor was it intended to be. It's visceral, primal, just like the world inside The Shimmer.For me, films work on three hierarchical levels: at the very basic, they should be entertaining. All films should succeed here (but not all do, which is why we should rightly slam those that don't!). Then, there are films that are not only entertaining but also elicit an emotional response; they move us in some way. Finally, there are entertaining films that are moving but also have meaning; they resonate on a deeper, often metaphysical level. To my mind, Annihilation achieves all three.Forget the plot holes. They exist in every film, otherwise they wouldn't be stories. Some of my favourite films have canyon-sized plot holes and inconsistencies. If you analyse any film you'll find them, and often you don't have to look very hard, e.g. Back to the Future. Do the plot holes and gaps in logic stop BTTF from being a great film? Not to my mind, because I'm invested in the movie. Plot holes only matter to me when they draw me away from the film; if it fails to entertain me.Does the plot in Annihilation even really matter? The film is about the experience, the visuals and audio, the curiosity, the suspense. A world that could only be accessible to us in our imaginations is here brought to life on the screen. It asks a lot of questions but isn't interested in the answers. It's bold, brave, challenging. Some of it is spectacular, some of it less so. Naturally, that will split opinion, but we've become too accustomed to the ready-packaged ""Happy Meal Movies"" that the studios churn out for us. We're addicted to them like we're addicted to sugary fast food. We should welcome any film that attempts to wean us off that and broaden our palates.This is a proper cinematic film, so what a shame it is that here in the UK (and many other countries) we were denied the pleasure of seeing it on the big screen. I can only imagine how even more beguiling and entrancing the experience would've been.Turn off the lights, switch off your phones, and sit back and feed your imagination and sense of wonder. I know that's why I watch and love films. 8.5/10."
U Turn,1997,6.7,A man heading to Vegas to pay off his gambling debt before the Russian mafia kills him is forced to stop in an Arizona town where everything that can go wrong does go wrong.,"A marked gambler (Penn) on the run, comes to a little town in the middle of nowhere, south USA. A town filled with very unusual characters, sordid secrets and strange opportunities, that seem very appealing to this ""Pat Poker"" on the run, which desperately needs money to pay the idiotic, redneck town mechanic. Penn and Nolte are at the greatest level, and Lopez fills the requisites of her character. Beautiful piece of writing, with surprising plot twists which make way to a most brilliant ending, ""Stone"" style despair. A very misunderstood work by this brilliant, all-American director. Another piece of genuine America, with all her virtues and even more flaws, seen trough ""stone"" cold eyes..."
American Horror Story,,7.9,"An anthology horror drama series centering on different characters and locations, showcasing different aspects of horror. Created and produced by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk.","Reviewers say 'American Horror Story' garners mixed opinions, with early seasons like 'Murder House' and 'Asylum' lauded for compelling narratives, strong performances, and innovative horror. Conversely, later seasons such as 'Cult' and 'Double Feature' face criticism for quality decline, political themes, and weaker storytelling. Despite inconsistencies, the anthology format and recurring cast maintain a dedicated fan base. Overall, 'American Horror Story' is viewed as groundbreaking yet uneven, with significant variations in quality and reception across its seasons."
Mrs. Fletcher,,7.1,A single mom whose son has moved out for college looks to begin a new life on her own.,"Wow I was anxiously awaiting the next episodes and come to find out there are none! 7 is quite an odd number, but it was great and I want more! Love these characters and we are only just getting to know them!"
Patrick Melrose,,8.0,This series depicts how the son of an aristocratic family seeks redemption and recovery.,"I've never read the books prior to seeing this piece of work. The idea of a person from such a well off background suffering seems almost alien, almost contemptible. Who, as someone so fortunate can make themselves feel so small when those who have so little can be happy. It is this very dilemma which made me want to dislike the show. And yet, I found this episode, and hopefully the rest extremely touching. If you've ever had trouble with drugs or self-loathing you cannot help but feel the humanity and truth in the work. This work transcends class, the part where Melrose looks content after shooting up, staring aimlessly into the world is so understandable and relatable you can't help but feel compassion and emotion. If you've ever been high or on drugs and looked out to the world while sitting in your bed while content, you'll understand what it is like to be Melrose, that feeling is forever it seems. Yet, when you wake up, the fleeting happiness you felt dispels and you feel the sad self loathing of existence;the tomorrow.Cumberbatch performs incredibly in capturing the second-guessing inner monologue of someone overwhelmed with emotions. His charisma and ability to act vividly using facial ques and ticks makes this work what it is, yes, the writing is fantastic, but the life Cumberbatch brings to those words is what makes it unique."
The Mule,2018,7.0,A ninety-year-old horticulturist and Korean War veteran turns drug mule for a Mexican cartel.,"Earl Stone (Clint Eastwood) is a man who is ninety years old, broke, alone, and facing foreclosure of his business. He lives a solitary existence with a few friends.

L'uomo che compr√≤ la luna,2018,6.5,A Sardinian fisherman has promised the moon to the woman he loves. And Sardinian men always keep their promises.,"Charming fairy tale with magical realism touches. There's a wry, sardonic perspective on geopolitics, just what we need right now. I won't give away the ""plot"" - too convoluted and bizarre to really explain. Just watch it unfold before you, and smile and smile."
A Young Doctor's Notebook & Other Stories,,7.7,"In the early 20th century, a young doctor arrives in a small Russian village around the time of the Russian Revolution to work in the local hospital.","I've read the original several times and never thought that it is a comedy. But still I enjoy this series. Perhaps, nobody would look it if it were the dark depressive drama. It's always good to find some fun even in such circumstances. And I'm sure, Bulgakov wouldn't mind this interpretation. He was a master of comedy.I'm not a fun of Harry Potter films, I didn't realized who is Radcliffe, so it didn't prevent me from enjoying the film. If you can, try to forget about Harry Potter before watching. And about Mad Men as well. You'll lose the point if will try to find Don Draper here. I wish I haven't known any artists before.Thanks to those who took the risk and decided to do that. I'd like to see something of this kind by Chekhov's short stories"
Flawless,1999,6.4,An ultraconservative security guard suffers a debilitating stroke and is assigned to a rehabilitative program that includes singing lessons with the drag queen next door.,"I saw this film on a plane and thoroughly enjoyed it, particularly the performance of Philip Seymour Hoffmann whom I found spectacular as a lonely, vulnerable, witty drag queen reaching out to recent stroke victim, homophobic DeNiro.The two of them were marvelous - and the end of the film had an outtake of Hoffmann and DeNiro practicing ""The Name Game"" that alone was worth the entire movie.There were certainly stereotypes among the minor characters but the plot was good and so was the acting.My acting teacher used to describe plays/films like ""Virginia Wolff"" as love stories. Using his criteria of two people coming together, sharing experiences and touching each other's hearts - Flawless certainly qualifies as an atypical love story."
From the Earth to the Moon,,8.5,Dramatized portrayal of the Apollo manned space program.,"Reviewers say 'From the Earth to the Moon' is a critically acclaimed miniseries lauded for its meticulous detail, realistic portrayal, and high production values. The ensemble cast delivers strong performances, and the storytelling effectively highlights the human aspect of the space race. However, some episodes vary in quality, and there are occasional pacing and character development issues. Despite these minor flaws, it remains a must-watch for space enthusiasts and a notable television achievement."
Vox Lux,2018,5.9,An unusual set of circumstances brings unexpected success to a pop star.,"Especially when it comes through being a literal survivor of a despicable act - something I had no idea was going to happen, but sets quite the mood for the movie. We have different stages here and this might work as a good double bill to a documentary called ""F... Fame"". Well I don't think I have to spell the F word out for you to understand.This works as criticism about how society views celebrities, fame and how this might change everyone involved. But it is quite slow in its pace and it is rather subtle in its message too. So while the performances might seem over the top at times, that does not go for the understanding of the movie or what it represents. Which might and will feel frustrating to watch for quite a few people - I'm split too on my verdict as you can see. Can't blame the actors who really do their best"
Hung,,7.2,"A former high school sports legend, turned middle-aged high school basketball coach, finds a way to benefit from his biggest asset.","Unlike some others on this site that watch the pilot and think they can claim the entire series to be ""sophomoric,"" I took the time to view three episodes before commenting. In doing so, I've found the series to be the type that leaves me wanting more...and more. I love the relationship dynamics; I love the witty exchanges; and I love the whole sexed up premise of the show--even as a man that boasts an advanced degree.Sophomoric? I suppose if you're afraid of your own sexuality, of strong women, and of relationships, sure, you might view it that way.Otherwise, it's a fun new series."
Shazam!,2019,7.0,A newly fostered young boy in search of his mother instead finds unexpected super powers and soon gains a powerful enemy.,"Reviewers say 'Shazam!' is a fun, family-oriented superhero film with humor and a unique twist. Zachary Levi's performance is praised, and the blend of comedy and action is noted. Critics appreciate its message about family and friendship, though some find it predictable and lacking depth. Visual effects and action sequences receive mixed reviews. The balance between humor and emotional moments is highlighted, but the villain is often criticized."
My Family,,7.5,"Ben Harper, a misanthropic dentist, has little time for most people, including his wife Susan, and their children Nick, Janey, and Michael.","Robert Lindsay and Zoe Wanamaker star as the parents of Kris Marshall, Daniela Denby-Ashe, and Gabriel Thomson in ""My Family,"" a very successful British television series that lasted 11 years.Unfortunately only the first few seasons are available on disk thus far, but it is a very funny and lively series. Lindsay and Wanamaker are terrific pros as the head of the Harper household. The beleaguered Ben Harper is a dentist and iffy housewife Susan, who definitely can't cook, is a tour guide. Nick (Marshall) has a new job every episode. I think the funniest episode was when Susan's boss stayed overnight and the next morning, Nick tried to take some bacon and Susan told him it was for their house guest. Then Ben finds Susan's boss dead. When he announces it, Nick asks, ""Can I have his bacon?"" Michael (Thomson) grows up on the show, and when the disks stop, he is developing an interesting life as a chick magnet and a wheeler dealer. Janey is in college, and the situation is not without problems.Kris Marshall is still in the show when the disks leave off, but I can imagine it was rough going without him. He added so much humor to the show. The writers must have had a blast with that outrageous character.Highly recommended. Not every episode is spectacular, but it's still a wonderful and well-acted series."
Watchmen,,8.2,"Set in an alternate history where masked vigilantes are treated as outlaws, Watchmen embraces the nostalgia of the original groundbreaking graphic novel of the same name, while attempting to break new ground of its own.","Reviewers say 'Watchmen' is a complex, ambitious series that delves into race, politics, and power, continuing the graphic novel's legacy. Praised for intricate storytelling, strong performances, and bold issue exploration, it faces criticism for deviating from the source material and political undertones. Cinematography, character development, and graphic novel integration are lauded, yet some find it confusing and inconsistent. Overall, 'Watchmen' is a divisive, compelling addition sparking debate among fans and critics."
Escape Room,2019,6.4,Six strangers find themselves in a maze of deadly mystery rooms and must use their wits to survive.,"7/10 I enjoyed it, the rooms were amazing, the characters were likable, the movie had intense moments, I like the fact the characters were working together. It was great to get some type of backstory on each character."
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,2019,6.6,"Maleficent and her goddaughter Aurora begin to question the complex family ties that bind them as they are pulled in different directions by impending nuptials, unexpected allies, and dark new forces at play.","It was kinda predictable, but in a nice, Disney-way... There was a sense of humor, action, fantasy and drama... I really love that Maleficent is more than just the villain,it shows that people have more layers...
Also Angelina Jolie and Michelle Pfeiffer in one movie, haven't we all been waiting for that? And upcoming star Elle Fanning showed a soft nevertheless badass Aurora... It's just a shame Brenton Thwaites (prince Philip) couldn't be in it..."
Colette,2018,6.7,"Colette is pushed by her husband to write novels under his name. Upon their success, she fights to make her talents known, challenging gender norms.","Colette is yet another tale of female empowerment: a woman with real talent trying to break out of the gilded cage she finds herself trapped in.This is a true story, set in Paris in the late 19th Century. Colette (Keira Knightley), a beautiful country girl living in Burgundy is seduced by and then married to the much older Parisian 'literary entrepreneur' Willy (Dominic West). Willy is a ""brand"" in Paris: a well-known critic turned author. The only problem being that he does virtually no writing of his own but ghosts work out to his team. Colette exhibits a gift for writing slightly lascivious tales of her life (under the pseudonym Claudine) at her girl's school, where clearly nighttime swimming lessons taught more than back stroke! As a result, Willy fills a financial hole by publishing Colette's work in his name. The books fly off the shelves faster than the publishers can print them. But Willy has expensive habits and Colette gets locked into writing an ever-popular series but without a voice of her own.If the ""swinging 60's"" started anywhere, it was probably in Paris during this time period! While Victorian England was staid and conservative, Paris - home of the Moulin Rouge - was a hot-bed of liberation. As a result, Colette and Willy's marital affairs are - erm - sexually 'fluid'. While Colette has to learn to live with her philandering 'Free Willy', he positively encourages the bi-sexual Colette to explore the other camp, as it were.Keira Knightley turns in a truly cracking performance in the titular lead. No-one does 'brooding' better than Knightley, and she gets ample chance here to exercise that look, most notably in a train scene near the end of the film: if looks could kill.Dominic West delivers as reliably a solid performance as you would expect from him, but he is such a despicable and loathsome character that it is difficult to warm to him.Driving me mad (not sexually you understand.... although...) was the girl playing the American double-dip love interest Georgie: I knew her so well but just couldn't place her. It was the American accent that threw me: she is of course Eleanor Tomlinson, Demelza from TV's ""Poldark"", here showing a lot more flesh than she can get away with on a Sunday night on BBC1!The film is obviously in English about one of France's literary greats (although curiously Colette writes in French). My guess is that the film will go down like a lead balloon in France as a result. A part of me would have liked this to be French language with subtitles, but maybe that's just me.When you look at it objectively, Colette's story is quite remarkable: what a clever and determined woman.Aside from Knightley, the other star turn in the film comes from cinematographer Giles Nuttgens (who also did ""Hell or High Water""). The scenes, particularly the bucolic ones set in the French countryside, are simply gorgeously photographed. The framing of the shots is also exquisite with an impressive shot of the slog up a spiral staircase to the couple's flat being repeatedly used.It remains curious to me how prudish both the UK and the US are still about sex on screen. In the UK the film is a 15 certificate; in the US the film is R-rated! Yes, there are some breasts on show, and a few mixed- and same-sex couplings (particularly during a frenetic 5 minute period in the middle of the film!), but they are artfully done and you don't get to see much more than the breasts. In comparison, the violence that would get meted out during a 15/R action thriller would typically makes my eyes water.This is one of those films that is worthy, beautifully done, well acted but for some reason it felt to me like a bit of a slog. At 111 minutes it certainly felt a lot longer than it was. The middle reel of the film in particular is rather pedestrian (and yes, I recognise the irony of the fact that I just said there was the frenetic 5 minutes of sex during that part!). Maybe on the night I was just not in the mood for this type of film.The director is Englishman Wash Westmoreland, whose last film back in 2014 was the impressive ""Still Alice"".I'm glad I've seen it, and it is a lot better than many films I saw last year. But in terms of my ""re-watchability"" quotient, its not going to rate that highly.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook. Thanks)."
Late Night,2019,6.5,A late night talk show host suspects that she may soon lose her long-running show.,I think those who came to this movie expecting a comedy were disappointed. I came to it expecting stellar performances by great lead performers. I found a good drama which met my expectations. This is more thinky than funny and it spends its capital on taking us on Katherine Newbury's journey back to herself and her humanity via the addition to her staff of an unwelcomed but intrepid fan. I liked this movie and give it a 7 (good) out of 10. {Drama}
ER,,7.9,The doctors who work in the ER at the County General Hospital in Chicago grapple with ups and downs in their personal and professional lives while trying to give apt medical care to their patients.,"Reviewers say 'ER' is celebrated for its compelling drama, realistic hospital portrayal, and strong early-season character development. The ensemble cast, including Anthony Edwards and George Clooney, is praised for balancing drama and humor. Criticisms include key character departures, quality decline, and less likable new characters. Some note inconsistencies in medical accuracy and overly dramatic storylines. Despite these issues, 'ER' is often regarded as a groundbreaking medical drama."
El hoyo,2019,7.0,"In a prison where inmates are fed on a descending platform, those on the upper levels take more than their fair share while those below are left to starve on scraps and one man decides to change the system.","It's a very clever and interesting premise, it came up as a horror recommendation, I would class it more in the suspenseful thriller bracket. It showcases mankind at its very worst, it basically sets out a message that you're alright at the top, and as you come down the social order, things just get worse and worse, with those above you doing slightly better.Socially and ideologically this is a major triumph, it really does get you thinking, particularly in these days where has had such a terrible impact worldwide.I thought the acting was superb, normally I dislike dubbed films, but in this instance I didn't even notice it, I enjoyed it that much.Genuinely terrific acting. I would have liked to have seen a bit of those running the regime, but I guess they wanted ambiguity.Quality, 9/10."
Gemini Man,2019,5.7,An over-the-hill hitman faces off against a younger clone of himself.,"Given the amount of recent Will Smith flops in recent years, I was a little apprehensive about watching Gemini Man on the big screen. Even with Ang Lee on board as director...But alas, I was very pleasantly surprised!Gemini Man plays like a 007 feature directed by John Woo. It just screams Hollywood action blockbuster from its big cast to its cliched dramatic moments, and its huge CGI filled action scenes to its international locations.While not completely flawless, the CGI is very impressive and equals that seen in most Marvel movies today from its de-aging process to its intense fights and action sequences. That said, in the final scene I'm sure I saw young Will Smith's change about 3 or 4 times - but a minor gripe.The action is huge of course in the scale of a Mission Impossible film, with plenty of one-shot scenes that make it all the more impressive! From motorbike chases to gun-play and plenty of hand-to-hand combat, any action fan should come away feeling more than pleased.While note a masterpiece, Gemini Man is pretty damn good fun and a welcome return to form for Smith at this stage!"
Ghost World,2001,7.3,"Two eccentric best friends graduate high school and respond to a man's romance-seeking newspaper ad as a gag, only to find their lives becoming increasingly complicated.","Ghost World is endearingly odd, a dryly funny satire of the awkward phase after high school and before adulthood. I greatly enjoyed it; my partner strongly disliked it, finding it awkwardand unfunny. It's certainly not a movie for everyone, and I suspect you'll know in the first half hour whether it's for you.The movie is about Enid and Becky, two high school friends who seem to own the anti-cool clique and have no real plans for life after graduation other than to get an apartment together - though Enid has not officially graduated and needs to take a remedial art class in the summer in order to finish out her credits. (There's more than a passing resemblance to the Daria and Jane relationship, for those who remember that show.) Becky seems to be handling the transition better: she gets a job and picks out an apartment. Enid instead seems insistent on taking an apathetic, hipster approach towards everything and everyone, deeming it all so lame as to be unworthy of effort, other than her affection for Seymour, a dorky record collector many, many years her senior who has few friends and even fewer romantic prospects.Without ever being in your face politically, Ghost World has great social commentary on art, relationships, and consumer culture. It's a weird movie, and you'll either love it or roll your eyes at it, but I hope it's the former."
Zombieland: Double Tap,2019,6.7,"Columbus, Tallahassee, Wichita, and Little Rock move to the American heartland as they face off against evolved zombies, fellow survivors, and the growing pains of the snarky makeshift family.","I just got out of Zombieland: Double TapI wasn't the biggest fan of the first movie, i thought it was fun, but I never felt the need to rewatch it and i promptly forgot about it until the sequel was announced.This is laugh out loud funny at times, I know zombie apocalypse movies are not where you expect to find laughs, but this has a lot of them. There was a lot of laughter in my screening.Woody Harrelson is as awesome as he always is, and is on top form, its always nice to see Emma Stone playing a fun role, her parts down so serious lately!! Yes, i know she is an Oscar winner and she should be playing the best parts she can get, its just nice to see her having fun in a role again, as she is a good comedic actress, I love some of her facial expressions.Now, when I hear the name Abigail Breslin, its always the little girl from My Sisters Keeper and Little Miss Subshine who pops into my head, I always forget the has grown up!! Even though I though i though she was great in Maggie with Arnie. She is fun here too, although her character is more of a plot device than anything else. A bit of a waste of her talents.But it was Zoey Deutch who steals the movie for me. She was such an unexpected, delightful surprise. Playing the dumb blonde is a hard act to do well without being annoying!! Generally outside of one or two performances I hate the cliche of a dumb blonde character, but she nails it. I wouldn't be surprised if this is her breakout role."
Annabelle Comes Home,2019,5.9,"While babysitting the daughter of Ed and Lorraine Warren, a teenager and her friend unknowingly awaken an evil spirit trapped in a doll.","Reviewers say 'Annabelle Comes Home' offers entertaining scares and strong performances, particularly from McKenna Grace, Madison Iseman, and Katie Sarife. The film is lauded for its Gothic atmosphere and stylish photography. However, criticisms arise for its reliance on clich√©s, weak storyline, and predictable scares. The limited screen time for Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga is disappointing, and some feel it falls short of earlier Conjuring Universe films."
Terminator: Dark Fate,2019,6.2,"An augmented human and Sarah Connor must stop an advanced liquid Terminator from hunting down a young girl, whose fate is critical to the human race.","Reviewers say 'Terminator: Dark Fate' garnered mixed reactions. Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger's return was celebrated, with standout performances. Action scenes and special effects impressed many, deemed exciting and visually striking. However, the plot faced criticism for being repetitive and unoriginal, often compared unfavorably to earlier films. Predictability and over-reliance on nostalgia were noted issues. New characters' development varied in reception. Despite flaws, many found it an enjoyable, though not exceptional, franchise addition."
Gerald's Game,2017,6.5,"A couple tries to spice up their marriage in a remote lake house. After the husband dies unexpectedly, the wife is left handcuffed to their bed frame and must fight to survive and break free.","Worth the watch. But not for the Marvel/Star Wars crowd. As you can probably tell from the reviews, there were not enough explosions or CGI to keep most people entertained."
Pok√©mon: Detective Pikachu,2019,6.5,"In a world where people collect Pok√©mon to do battle, a boy comes across an intelligent talking Pikachu who seeks to be a detective.","I give it a 6 just for Ryan Renolds an for pokemons which look very nice. But, overall the movie is very stupid. It is sad they had such a great background and they could't produce a cool movie."
Stuber,2019,6.2,A detective recruits his Uber driver into an unexpected night of adventure.,"A perfect light evening filler where I laughed a lot. Bautista and Nanjinani worked great together. A movie I would probably watch again, which I can not say a lot these days."
Godzilla II: King of the Monsters,2019,6.0,"The crypto-zoological agency Monarch faces off against a battery of god-sized monsters, including the mighty Godzilla, who collides with Mothra, Rodan, and his ultimate nemesis, the three-headed King Ghidorah.","The whole dramatic family story wasn't able to catch me. It isn't annoying, but allways kind of irrelevant. Every scene including monsters on the other hand is stuning. In General the monster design, the CGI, the fights and the whole cinematography aswell are beyond beautiful. I recommand the movie because of those monster scenes. Everything what happens around that is more like a 3/10"
Jumanji: The Next Level,2019,6.6,"In Jumanji: The Next Level, the gang is back but the game has changed. As they return to rescue one of their own, the players will have to brave parts unknown from arid deserts to snowy mountains, to escape the world's most dangerous game.","Even though its central concept seems ever-so-slightly more strained this time, 'Jumanji: The Next Level (2019)' is about as good as its predecessor. In fact, it's sometimes even better. Basically, the flick is just fun. The crowd-pleasing body-swapping is amped up to eleven, shaking things up just enough so that they feel fresh. The main actors continue to properly impress in their chameleon-like roles, joined by a few extra treats that perform far better than you'd perhaps expect. Indeed, these new players are probably its biggest asset; a couple of them thoroughly perforate the entire experience despite only having a rather small amount of screen-time. The picture is often funny - though, never hilarious - and is oddly endearing, to boot. It isn't particularly deep or, even, memorable but it doesn't need to be. It's a good time at the movies; what more do you need? Obviously some better theming and, perhaps, a tad of nuance wouldn't go amiss, but it's just not that kind of film really and that's perfectly fine. Even if it doesn't impact you as much as some of the year's best, it'll certainly make you smile and keep you entertained for a couple of hours. Besides, its inciting incident is driven purely by character and it even manages to squeeze some genuine emotional connection, via a well-drawn dynamic between DeVito and Glover, into its otherwise otherworldly proceedings. Its acting is also deceptively simple but decidedly fantastic, fully immersing you in the idea that these major stars are actually four teenagers and two old men. Basically, it's not as simple as you might think. 7/10"
Annabelle,2014,5.5,A couple begins to experience terrifying supernatural occurrences involving a vintage doll shortly after their home is invaded by satanic cultists.,"Reviewers say 'Annabelle' is a horror film exploring motherhood, loss, and the supernatural. Set in the 1970s, it follows a couple experiencing terrifying events after receiving a haunted doll. Reviews highlight the eerie atmosphere, jump scares, and unsettling doll presence. Praised for creepy moments and strong performances, especially Annabelle Wallis, it is criticized for relying on horror tropes and lacking originality. Cinematography and sound design enhance tension, making it a solid addition to the Conjuring Universe."
Charlie's Angels,2019,5.0,"When a young systems engineer blows the whistle on a dangerous technology, Charlie's Angels are called into action, putting their lives on the line to protect us all.","I'm not sure why everyone has such a problem with this movie. It met all the criteria ... funny, suspenseful, tons of unrealistic stunts ... like any other action movie. Was there a dose of female love? Sure. What is wrong with that? If you want a movie to change your life? Not this one. If you want a fun, entertaining action flick? This is a good one."
The Leftovers,,8.3,"Three years after the disappearance of 2% of the global human population, a group of people in a small New York community try to continue their lives while coping with the tragedy of the unexplained nature of the event.","Reviewers say 'The Leftovers' is an emotional, thought-provoking series exploring grief and loss. It is praised for complex characters, exceptional acting, and intelligent writing. However, some find the pacing slow and mysteries unresolved, causing frustration. The show's ambiguous storytelling is both celebrated for depth and criticized for confusion. Its slow burn and demand for viewer engagement divide opinions, with some appreciating depth and others finding it tedious."
Game of Thrones,,9.2,"Nine noble families fight for control over the lands of Westeros, while an ancient enemy returns after being dormant for millennia.","Reviewers say 'Game of Thrones' is acclaimed for its intricate plot, complex characters, and stunning cinematography. The show is lauded for its high production value, detailed world-building, and intelligent dialogue. Many appreciate the faithful adaptation of George R.R. Martin's books. However, the final seasons faced criticism for rushed storytelling and inconsistent character arcs, though earlier seasons are highly regarded."
Drakulics elvt√°rs,2019,6.4,"Vampires are among us. But no need to worry: the Hungarian Secret Police are after them, and beyond the usual spy gadgets, they even use garlic to repel the beasts. Hungary in the 70s. Comrade F√°bi√°n (Zsolt Nagy), the Hungarian hero of the Cuban revolution, comes home to take part in a blood drive for Vietnam, the communist sister nation of Hungary. But something is w...Read all","I did not watch the same movie as the other reviewers, therefore the more positive notation. This is not a vampire comedy, this is a political satire with vampires, in the same way ""Juan de los muertos"" was a political satire with zombies.The film pokes fun at Hungary in the Kadar and Brejnev era, and there is a number of nice jokes about the great camaraderie of socialist countries. Our vampire here is both the unruly presence of opposants second guessing the system and the appetite for western freedom and wealth.This is a well done, nicely acted, and fun film. A little slow sometimes but overall quite a nice bit of self deriding post communism reflection. We would do well in the western block to have that much humour sometimes."
Bloodshot,2020,5.7,"Ray Garrison, a slain soldier, is re-animated with superpowers.","Reviewers say 'Bloodshot' garners mixed opinions. Vin Diesel's performance and action sequences are praised for entertainment value, though some find the plot predictable and lack originality. Diesel's acting range is criticized by a few. CGI and special effects receive varied opinions, with some appreciating visuals and others deeming them mediocre. Guy Pearce's villainous role is often positively highlighted. Overall, 'Bloodshot' is viewed as a passable action film with franchise potential, though it doesn't significantly stand out in the superhero genre."
Playing with Fire,2019,5.2,A crew of rugged firefighters meet their match when attempting to rescue three rambunctious kids.,"It's not as bad as all the reviews on here say. It's a kids movie and my kids enjoyed it, that's all that really counts."
Ready or Not,2019,6.8,A bride's wedding night takes a sinister turn when her eccentric new in-laws force her to take part in a terrifying game.,"This was a good bit of fun. Dark comedy with plenty of gore and an explosive ending. Still filled with bonehead decision making, as one would expect with a horror type film.Samara Weaving does well as the bride, and surprisingly does not just turn into some random badass with a mystery background complete with combat training.Think 'Knives Out' mixed with 'The Hunt' and voila, you have 'Ready or Not'."
Stranger Things,,8.6,"In 1980s Indiana, a group of young friends witness supernatural forces and secret government exploits. As they search for answers, the children unravel a series of extraordinary mysteries.","Reviewers say 'Stranger Things' is acclaimed for its nostalgic 1980s pop culture references, strong character development, and atmospheric setting. The young cast's chemistry and high production values are frequently praised. However, some criticize the show for plot predictability, uneven season quality, and underdeveloped character arcs. Season 3, in particular, faced mixed reviews for its reliance on clich√©s. Despite these issues, the series retains a robust fan base and is often lauded for its nostalgic appeal and thrilling supernatural elements."
Saw,2003,7.4,"David, an orderly at a hospital, tells his horrific story of being kidnapped and forced to play a vile game of survival.","The short film, SAW, shows very clever filmmaking in the horror genre. There hasn't been anything clever like this short film for years.David, an orderly of a hospital, has been kidnapped and faces his ultimate test. He must survive by killing another man that holds the key to his freedom. He wakes up, having a rusty contraption strapped to his face. Then, a mysterious puppet on the TV says if he doesn't remove the trap off his face in sixty seconds, his jaw will be ripped open.Once this short gets green-lit into a major motion picture, this exact scene has been tweaked up and was used in the first SAW film. It's heart-pounding and fun to watch! I recommend this short film to not just to SAW fans, but to curious folks that want to take step into the world of horror. Great short film!"
Tim Burton's the Nightmare Before Christmas,1993,7.9,"Jack Skellington, king of Halloween Town, discovers Christmas Town, but his attempts to bring Christmas to his home causes confusion.","Jack Skellington is the Pumpkin King ¬ñ the creative genius behind the holiday of Halloween, designing each year to be scarier and more horrible than the one before. However deep inside he longs for more than the horror and scares of Halloween Town, a longing he cannot understand until he stumbles into Christmas Town and sees happiness and cheer the likes of which has evaded him all these years. Having finally worked out what Christmas is all about, Jack decides to kidnap Santa and make himself the new king of Christmas Town so that he can have the happiness of Christmas all the time. But the others in the towns realize the significant consequences that this disruption of the norm will have as Jack's evil nature proves harder to overcome than he thought.With Pixar currently dominating the world of 'animations that please both children and adults' it is easy to forget that over a decade ago Tim Burton delivered this delightful family film to the cinema using a much more traditional animation and a huge amount of imagination. The basic plot is a great little fantasy fairytale with a very dark heart to it that make it much more enjoyable for having that edge. Too often kids films (especially at the time and animated) are soaked in a sweet sentiment that simply forgets that kids are not stupid and indeed often prefer a bit of darkness in the story. The only downside of this darkness is that younger children might not 'get it' and just end up being scared by the Halloween images and imaginative images. Despite this the material will play equally well to adults and children because it neither panders to nor excludes one group over the other at any time. Regardless of the material, the film still manages to come off as charming and enjoyable thanks to a well-written script that never plays for the basic laugh or easy sentiment. Some viewers may come to this with Pixar in their minds and bemoan it for not being hilariously funny from start to finish, but they are missing the point andThe songs reflect this approach and are very clever throughout; whether it is the sorrowful longing of Jack at the start or the Cab Calloway-inspired song from Oogie Boogie Man, generally they are inventive and fun. The same praise can be laid at the door of the stop-motion animation, which is inventive and fun to look at from start to finish. All the characters have a great deal of effort put in and they add to the dark feel of the film. The voice cast may not feature a load of well-known voices in the same way as Pixar films generally do, but they still do a great job. Sarandon and Elfman combine to do a good job with Jack; Page is fun as Oogie Boogie; O'Hara is good as Sally despite not having as fun a character to work with but for my money it is Hickey (as Dr Finklestein) and Shadix (Mayor) that make the biggest impression, mainly due to having the most enjoyable characters.Overall this is a very short but very enjoyable film that will please both children and adults at the same time (with the same material) and never ignores or panders to one side of the audience over the other. Both groups will appreciate the dark fairytale, the clever songs, the darkly imaginative animation and the comic sense of humour, making this a family film that deserves to be remembered even as kids movie get smarter and fancier."
Bad Boys for Life,2020,6.5,Miami detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett must face off against a mother-and-son pair of drug lords who wreak vengeful havoc on their city.,"How does this Bad Boys sequel gets such a high rating? There's clearly some cheating going on with those ratings. Bad Boys For Life is without a doubt the worst movie of this franchise. I did enjoy the early Bad Boys so I thought this one would be in the same lineage but all I got was irritation. I don't know who wrote this script but it's cringing to watch at times. We're used to overly exaggerated action scenes in this kind of movies but here it just gets ridiculous. The chemistry between Will Smith and the normally always funny Martin Lawrence is completely lost. I could count the funny moments on one hand, and even with those I had to force a smile. I can't say I did enjoy this movie, I was glad when I saw the end credits appearing, and I sincerely hope that they will close this chapter forever. We don't need another Bad Boys."
Jojo Rabbit,2019,7.9,"A young German boy in the Hitler Youth, whose hero and imaginary friend is the country's dictator, is shocked to discover that his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their home.","It's WWII and Germany is losing the war. 10 year old Jojo Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) can't tie his own shoes and has an imaginary friend in Hitler (Taika Waititi). He is starting Hitler youth training under weary war veteran Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell). He refuses to kill a rabbit and the guys ridicule him as Jojo Rabbit. One day, he finds a girl living in the wall of his late sister's room. His mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding Jewish girl Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie).This is an inventive film. It is feel-good and heart-breaking. It has comedy and tragedy. It is an outside-the-box, brilliant film from the unusual Taika Waititi. The kid is brilliant. The best friend is funny. ScarJo is terrific. There are some big-time emotional gut punches. There are surprising turns. This is one of the year's best."
Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues,2013,6.3,"With the 1970s behind him, Ron Burgundy, San Diego's former top-rated newsreader, returns to take New York City's first twenty-four-hour news channel by storm.","The first ""Anchorman"" movie is one of the most quotable comedy movies of all-time. When I sat down in the theater for the long-awaited sequel, I expected more humor along the same lines (if not quite as fresh). That is exactly what I received...and in the case of comedy films that is a win for all parties involved.For a basic plot summary, ""Anchorman 2"" tells the story once again of Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell), a man born to look good and read the news. When wife Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) essentially takes his job, however, Ron must decide what the next direction is that his life should take. With input from the old news team of Brick Tamland (Steve Carrell), Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), and Champ Kind (David Koechner), Ron decides to pursue an opportunity to land on a 24-hour news station.This sequel primarily works because of Ferrell's impeccably honed Burgundy character. When some of the jokes inevitably fall flat, sometimes just Ferrell's reactions alone can carry a scene. Without his strong presence, this franchise (and especially this installment) would be utterly lost. Does the movie contain an ensemble cast? To be sure. All the auxiliary parts work well together...but they also have some jokes that fall completely flat or are just plain stupid. Only the ""Burgundy scenes"" are the ones that are consistently hilarious.Basically, ""Anchorman 2"" is a four-star movie (though not five) because it continues the solid humor of the original. It contains more than its share of fresh jokes, but others are just a bit stale because they have essentially been done before. That's not fault of its own, of course, but the characters were just so fresh in the original that now they don't ""pop"" quite as much here. Essentially, this is probably about the best sequel that could have been expected for this franchise."
Saw,2004,7.6,"Two men awaken to find themselves on the opposite sides of a dead body, each with specific instructions to kill the other, escape or face the consequences. These two are the latest contestants in Jigsaw's games.","A sicko movie whose nastiness is almost topped by its weirdness...so obviously any true horror fan worth their salt needs to seek it out! The story is about a surgeon and a photographer who wake up and to find themselves shackled at opposite ends of a nasty-looking toilet. Don't want to say too much but plenty of ugliness ensues. This movie has the perfect mix of scares and a really bizarre plot. The movie's got a decent budget for an indie horror (a little over a million, i think) but it's pretty small for a film that got such a big release. I hear it made a ""killing"" at the box office, so TAKE NOTICE Hollywood! People want to see this stuff. Go!"
Le Mans '66,2019,8.1,American car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles battle corporate interference and the laws of physics to build a revolutionary race car for Ford in order to defeat Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966.,"Reviewers say 'Ford v Ferrari' is lauded for its exhilarating racing scenes, stellar performances by Christian Bale and Matt Damon, and captivating narrative. The film's technical prowess, immersive visuals, and emotional resonance are frequently highlighted. Conversely, some critics note a sluggish pace, underdeveloped characters, and a conventional script. Nevertheless, it is commonly viewed as a remarkable sports drama, delivering an enthralling mix of action, drama, and historical insight."
Fantasy Island,2020,4.9,"When the owner and operator of a luxurious island invites a collection of guests to live out their most elaborate fantasies in relative seclusion, chaos quickly descends.","Never saw the original show but this was a nightmare of a film and I mean that in a bad way. A bit like KNIVES OUT in terms of set-up but then turning into a turgid mess with a lot of mystery, some random action scenes, and a lot of tiresome fantasy stuff. I didn't like the characters, didn't buy their motivations, and found the whole thing increasingly silly as it went on, a bit like LOST for the 2020s. The only good part was Michael Rooker's action man role."
Ad Astra,2019,6.5,"Astronaut Roy McBride undertakes a mission across an unforgiving solar system to uncover the truth about his missing father and his doomed expedition that now, 30 years later, threatens the universe.","I have just seen movie at the Venice film festival.
A few quick thoughts
-great cinematography(Hoyte has done it again) and acting from Brad and Tommy
-there are a couple of interesting scenes that I did not really expect in the middle of the movie
-sound editing top notchIt is a movie more for the critics and lovers of cinema art , and less for general public wanting some space sci-fi epic.
But everyone will find somethig to enjoy in this film and I reccomend to see it !"
It: Chapter Two,2019,6.5,"Twenty-seven years after their first encounter with the terrifying Pennywise, the Losers Club have grown up and moved away, until a devastating phone call brings them back.","I was originally hesitant to see director Andy Muschietti's rendition of Stephen King's beloved book ""It"" back in 2017, but after hearing splendid reviews from fans and critics; I took a chance and came out pleasantly surprised. Since then, I agree with why that is now considered by many to be a modern Horror classic.Now our favorite Losers club are back to face Pennywise again in ""It: Chapter Two"". Adding up all of that and that this is my second most anticipated mainstream film of the year, does it live up to the hype? Well, somewhat. It's an imperfect but solid sequel.In spite of a three hour runtime it kept my attention for the entire ride. Like ""Chapter One""; it's wonderfully shot (with effective use of sepia tone colors) and the editing and scene transitions are eye popping. Many of the dialogue and scares are cleverly written (a scene at a restaurant is a highlight).In spite of an often unsettling plot, there is plenty of levity to be found here. It unfortunately suffers from inappropriate timing with many of the jokes, causing the film to play like a dark comedy. Half of the frightening and dramatic moments are finished by gags and one-liners. There is one scary sequence that really works until it's ruined by a joke straight out of a Deadpool film.The pacing is troubling at times; since some of the opening introductions are rushed, while certain flashbacks to the younger versions of the Losers Club could've been shorter. This makes the narrative not feel as fresh or as fulfilled compared to the first film.It's most accomplished at being an emotionally fulfilling journey for the Losers club. This is sharpened by the adult actors being dead ringers for the kids from the original; including the main highlight Bill Hader- an instant classic as Richie, as he combines the best of his talent from ""Saturday Night Live"" with intense urgency to best serve the idea of ""What would Richie from It be like if he grew up?""If you're looking for a good cinematic start for this Halloween season, and something to bring you back all the feels from Chapter One from September 2017; Chapter Two is a somewhat messy but nicely done job.Grade- B"
The Ritual,2017,6.4,"A group of old college friends reunite for a trip to a most dangerous country in Europe - Sweden, encountering a menacing presence there stalking them.","No spoilers in this review but having come away from watching this film, on my own at the local Empire Cinema on Friday 13th I would say this is a good horror film for those who are bored senseless by the endless tide of ""jump scare but not scary really"" horror films we have to endure these days.This is a proper story with a proper start, middle and end.At times unsettling, at times creepy, at times a bit distressing whilst always being restrained (its not an utter gore fest and the violence is all the more affecting for that) this is a decent film elevated by good characterisation and very good acting.Whilst nothing utterly original is on offer here, it is a film that does what it says on the tin and it is all done well. Special mention to Rafe Spall who, just like his dad, Timothy, continues to be brilliant in everything he's in.Solid 7/10 and one for fans of proper horror. It deserves to be seen at the cinema as well so I'd urge people to get to watch this."
Iliza: Unveiled,,6.5,"Iliza Shelsinger in her fifth Netflix stand-up special, discussing marriage and its traditions.","Sure, the material isn't old, but it feels old. It feels overused and while her schtick hasn't changed much over the years, I guess it's just not as on poin as it was? I expected the punchlines, and the voices and the ""twists"" in her jokes,so I was .. at best, mildly amused, at worst, I started playing candy crush. I guess it's worth watching, but that's the most I can give it."
Iliza: Elder Millennial,,7.2,"Newly engaged comic Iliza Shlesinger dives into undeniable truths about life at age 35, the insanity of the road traveled and what's to come.",I'm a 72 year old grandfather and I loved the material and the flawless delivery. So many subtle gestures at just the perfect time. Bravo
What We Do in the Shadows,,8.6,A look into the nightly lives of four vampires who have lived together on Staten Island for over a century.,"Reviewers say 'What We Do in the Shadows' is praised for its humor, unique characters, and clever writing. The mockumentary style and performances, especially Matt Berry and Natasia Demetriou, are highlighted. Comparisons to the original movie are favorable, noting expanded concepts and new characters. However, opinions on consistency and quality vary, with some noting a decline in humor and storylines. A few critics strongly disapprove of the humor and writing. Overall, it's seen as entertaining for fans of quirky comedy."
Enola Holmes,2020,6.6,"When Enola Holmes, Sherlock's sister, discovers her mother is missing, she endeavors to find her, becoming a super-sleuth in her own right as she outwits her famous brother and unravels a dangerous conspiracy.","This is the movie I wish I had at 15. This isn't about Sherlock Holmes. It's not about solving a mystery or surprising the audience. It's about a teenage girl finding out who she is. It was charming, funny, wonderfully acted, aesthetically pleasing, and sweet. If you are a grown man criticizing it, Back off. This wasn't made for you. Or me. This was made for 15 yro girls. And the fifteen year old girl in me LOVED it."
BlacKkKlansman,2018,7.5,"In this story inspired by true events, Ron Stallworth, an African-American Colorado police officer, successfully infiltrates the local branch of the Ku Klux Klan with the help of a white Jewish colleague.","Reviewers say 'BlacKkKlansman' is a powerful film addressing racism and identity politics, lauded for strong performances by John David Washington and Adam Driver. Spike Lee's direction and cinematography effectively convey its message. However, some critics note pacing, dialogue, and plot issues. The film's humor-drama blend and political commentary resonate with many, though its length and narrative choices draw some criticism. Overall, 'BlacKkKlansman' is seen as an important and impactful work."
The Revenant,2015,8.0,A frontiersman on a fur trading expedition in the 1820s fights for survival after being mauled by a bear and left for dead by members of his own hunting team.,"Reviewers say 'The Revenant' is acclaimed for its breathtaking cinematography and Leonardo DiCaprio's Oscar-worthy performance. Tom Hardy's intense portrayal is also noted. Themes of survival and revenge are central, though some find the narrative simplistic and pacing slow. Minimal dialogue and focus on physical endurance are both praised and criticized. The bear attack scene is lauded for its realism. Despite mixed views on story and character development, the film's visual and artistic achievements are widely recognized."
The Undoing,,7.4,"A modern twist to a classical ""whodunnit"" tale, when the life of a wealthy New York therapist turns upside down after she and her family get involved with a murder case.",Felt a little rushed in a couple of places but otherwise very watchable.Ruined only by some unintentionally comical moments when Nicole Kidman attempted to convey fear and other emotions on her overly botoxed face.
"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2",,8.3,The Batman has returned after a 10-year absence. The Gotham authorities want to arrest him. An old foe wants a reunion. The Feds want the Man of Tomorrow to put a stop to him.,"The latest in a fairly long line of animated adaptations or interpretations of the Batman mythos to be brought to the screen; The Dark Knight Returns was based on the four-part 1986 graphic novel brought to life by the now legendary Frank Miller. The very man whose formidable talent brought forth such renowned works as; Sin City and Watchmen to name but two, he seemingly had no involvement in any advisory or technical capacity. And if this full-length version, (it was originally released in two chapters on two individual DVD releases) is anything to go by, he needn't have done so as it remains irrevocably faithful to its source material.It focuses on how Bruce Wayne (voiced by; Peter Weller best known for his iconic role in 1980's sci-fi action hit; Robocop) who has long since retired after the untimely demise of Jason Todd; the second Robin feels compelled to return to a life of vigilantism. Gotham it seems is an even grimmer, meaner metropolis that has become more of a breeding ground for crime and is descending into inevitable anarchy. Arguably and some might claim irrefutably the most gritty and uncompromising depiction of the Dark Knight, it doesn't make it any less riveting and complex, all be it implausible.Adroitly selecting the criminally unhinged Harvey ""Two-Face"" Dent (Wade Williams) as the early antagonist who partially instigates the millionaire son of Gotham to don the cape and cowl once more; his dual nature is an ideal adage to the themes of the first half of the movie which explore duality. There's Bruce Wayne's double identity as the aged industrialist and the avenging Batman, with the divisiveness of public opinion over whether he is a positive force for change in Gotham or a self-imposed, meddling vigilante menace that is part of the problem rather than the solution. They're handled adeptly via vox pops with Gothamites which are broadcast on local news stations. Derivative it may be but it still has the desired effect. There are also the dual sides of the official and unofficial iconic symbols of justice; a 70-year-old Commissioner James Gordon (David Selby) who is on the verge of retiring with old friend and ally, Bruce entering again into the battlefield streets of their once beloved city. One's on his way out as the other one is finding himself drawn right back in. Their scenes together are relatively sparse but they hit the right note of bitter-sweet poignancy which compliments its darker more brooding tone.Dent aside; the genuine and more prominent threat in the first half is the brutal and ominous gang which is practically an army of degenerate hoodlums calling themselves; The Mutants. Led by the imposing, towering presence of the maniacal Mutant Leader who as a figurehead personifies their carnal savagery concisely. Not since Bane; have we seen a nemesis that is potentially a match for Batman, but then at 55 years of age, he is irretrievably past his prime. But this is Bruce Wayne and although his physical frame has become more beleaguered with age, his mettle hasn't. Peter Weller with the subtlety of his nuanced vocal performance oozes a quiet resolute firmness that barely seems to waver.Returning momentarily to the themes of duality, there's the welcome if tried and tested adage of a new Robin; this time gave the then more fresh spin of being a high-spirited (are they anything else?) teenage girl named Carrie Kelly and voiced with likable spunky idealism by Ariel Winter. However, given Bruce Wayne's previous reluctance and the impetus behind his retirement, one wonders if his readiness to accept young Miss Kelly to be his latest sidekick is a means to push forward the plot. It feels like expedience is a rationale for forgoing some semblance of plausibility. All the same, her addition makes for a wonderful story arc.Commencing with the second half, and with his presence being teasingly hinted at within the first; there is the inexorable inclusion of the once campy referred to; Clown Prince of Crime; The Joker whose vocals are brought to life by Michael Emerson of TV's; Lost and Person of Interest fame. His presence undeniably runs the risk of feeling contrived but this was Frank Miller's story we are talking about here and his figurative resurrection from a comatose state is beautifully realized. That first moment you hear his first few syllables which herald the beginning of the second act; you can't help but feel goosebumps. His personal story of his being incarcerated in a mental facility for an undisclosed period of time in a dormant state and his reemergence are masterfully executed. The incorporation of his therapist; the naively idealistic Dr. Bartholomew Wolper (an ever-reliable Michael McKean) also adds something to the overarching narrative. My one reservation with Emerson's portrayal is while he vocally has a chilling resonance; the iconic laugh just lacks the high-pitched maniacal oomph that Mark Hamill definitively rendered. Nevertheless; his return although brief, its impact is no less bad for it and serves to shine a light on the jaded nature of Bruce Wayne's former idealism.Entering into the fray; having the torch being passed to her by her successor James Gordon, is new Commissioner Ellen Yindel (Maria Cannais-Barrera) who represents a bold new generation of Gotham law enforcement. Steadfast in her convictions in regard to the law; she has a contradictory code of ethics to her predecessor who she never the less has underlining respect for him as he does for her. It would be easy to portray her as a partial villain of the piece, and while undoubtedly a thorn in Batman's side; her motives are anything if not pure.Finally, there is the final stage of the film, in which while the arc of the story plays out in parallel with the previous ongoing action; the slightly uneven and shaky relationship between Clarke Kent/Superman comes inevitably to ahead. Once a symbol of hope, he has become something of the antithesis of everything he is supposed to stand for as he has essentially become a weapon of the United States government, answering to; President Ronald Reagan (remember that the graphic novel was published back in 1986). Truth, Justice, and the American way have become glorified buzzwords to enshroud politically dubious intentions. The ultimate battle of two ideologies; that are diametrically opposed adds another layer to the depth and complexity of the overall narrative.The Dark Knight Returns, however, as I have hitherto affirmed is not a perfect movie, as neither was the graphic novel. With the superhero/comic-book genre a healthy amount of suspension of disbelief is required, although this in my personal view asks a tad too much in terms of Bruce Wayne's waning virility; while there could have been an in-depth struggle with his reconciling in enlisting a new youthful sidekick with the brutal death of Jason Todd. All in all, this is fundamentally an absorbing and richly composite tale that although not officially canon; would make for supplementary addition to the Batman saga. Its vocal performances are for the most part exemplary and its animation inspired, as it strikingly captures the dark, brooding aesthetic of Gotham City. In short; it's required viewing for any Batman aficionado."
"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1",,7.9,"Batman has not been seen for ten years. A new breed of criminal ravages Gotham City, forcing 55-year-old Bruce Wayne back into the cape and cowl. But, does he still have what it takes to fight crime in a new era?","No one does it better than the Bat at any age he is still the same, too smart for those who what to get on his bad side.This part1 is so good I can't wait to see the rest; I hope veterans like the joker will be there to make it all crazy like.Batman: The Dark Knight Returns is a two-part animated superhero film, an adaptation of the four-issue story arc The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller, printed in 1986.This animation is nowhere near the movies (i.e. story wise), and it focuses on the future, wrong choice of words it is about the future, Bruce Wayne is 55 and the bat has not been seen for 10 years.The story arc curved around the bat after retirement. Gotham now seemed to be overrun by a group called Mutants. The Mutants weren't just any gang they were absolutely ruthless and in a way useless.Also in this flick we get to see Harvey Dent/Two face after he has undergone plastic surgery to fix his face. Harvey now looked normal but he was so paranoid and out of it that he went back to his old ways.Things weren't changing in Gotham and with the ongoing nightmares and Bruce sleep walking and sleep doing things in the night; it was obvious he could no longer cage the bat any more.Bruce carved to the urges. In the dark is the ""billionairelly"" in sane Batman, is seen jumping over roof tops and doing things other billionaires could only dream that their bodyguards could do (because no sane billionaire jumps around in the dark. Imagine one day you look out the window only to see Bill Gates in his underwear and a cape on your roof¬Öwould you say Bill still got all his screws nicely tight?) I don't know what I liked better is it watching Bat being Bat again in his old age, or the bad guys not knowing in time to skip town when they found out he was out of retirement (you can't blame them though, some didn't know who he was).Well, the directing of this wonderful flick was done by Jay Oliva, who worked as a storyboard artist on Man of Steel, Batman: Year One and Batman: Under the Red Hood.The animation was well drawn, far better¬Ö sorry, far far far better than what we saw in Superman vs. the Elite.The only downside to this wonderful movie is the news casting; it was boring and looked too much like child's play I hope you are not still reading this, because I expect by now that you have hit the stores to go grab your copy of The Dark Knight Returns Part 1.www.lagsreviews.com"
The Conjuring,2013,7.5,Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren work to help a family terrorized by a dark presence in their farmhouse.,"Reviewers say 'The Conjuring' is lauded for its effective scares, strong performances, and atmospheric tension, with praise for Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson's chemistry. The film's subtle, psychological fear tactics are highlighted, though some criticize its lack of originality and similarities to other haunted house movies. Opinions on pacing and scare effectiveness are mixed, with varied reactions to its religious and exorcism elements. Overall, it's considered a solid horror film, though not a significant genre innovator."
Batman: Assault on Arkham,,7.4,Batman works desperately to find a bomb planted by the Joker while Amanda Waller hires her newly formed Suicide Squad to break into Arkham Asylum to recover vital information stolen by the Riddler.,"I just finishing watching Son of Batman, and I was thinking to myself, this movie is pretty edgy and leans more toward adults than I would ever expected. Than I saw Assault on Arkham, and can see were the DCAU is going. This is far more Edgy.The movie takes elements from the recent run of Suicide Squad of the new 52s revamp at DC comics and mixes it with elements of the Batman Akrham game series. Batman wears the costume from the game, but has the voice of the greatest man ever to play (voice) Batman, Kevin Conroy.Batman takes a slight step back in this movie as Amanda Waller assembles the suicide Squad to get a thumb drive the Riddler has on all the members of the Suicide Squad before he makes it public. They have to infiltrate Arkham in order to do it.The animated film is Dark, it reminds me of the late 80's early 90's anime like Gogolo 13 and fist of the North Star that got me into anime in the first place. I'm happy to see Warner Bros. animation go in this direction.Two thumbs up!"
The Invitation,2015,6.6,"When a man accepts an invitation to a dinner party hosted by his ex-wife, the unsettling past reopens old wounds and creates new tensions.",It's really a film about how social expectations can confine and prevent you from calling out weird and creepy behavior for fear of being rude.
Batman and Harley Quinn,2017,5.9,"Batman and Nightwing are forced to team with the Joker's sometimes-girlfriend Harley Quinn to stop a global threat brought about by Poison Ivy and Jason Woodrue, the Floronic Man.","I had a feeling that if they were going to make a movie where ""Harley Quinn"" is about half of the title, she would steal the show. And I was right! Unfortunately, the show which Harley stole was not not a very good one...At first I didn't know how to feel about this movie. I grew up on the ""Batman the Animated Series"" cartoons which this movie spawned from. Those cartoons always took themselves very seriously, and explored themes that were pretty dark and complex for kids shows at the time. However, that show ran in the '90s, and it's 2017 now, and Batman has been pretty thoroughly explored and picked apart on TV and in film since then (see The Lego Batman Movie).Maybe because of this, I think Paul Dini and Bruce Timm decided they would try a different route than what one might expect from the original cartoons: this movie DOES NOT take itself very seriously. Harley Quinn is good for that, she is making jokes and acting silly throughout. Batman and the main villains take themselves very seriously, but literally no other character in the movie does. About half of the jokes and antics are funny, and the other half fall pretty flat. Comedy was never the original series's strength though, in fact jokes falling flat was the norm. That normally wasn't a problem in the original series though, because the story, mystery, or character development was the focus, not the humor.In this movie though, the story is pretty generic, there is no mystery, and there aren't very many new or interesting characters to develop. On top of that, the focus of this movie is shifted more onto the humor and to Harley Quinn's various antics, which makes it feel, well... really CAMPY. Honestly though, many of Batman's iterations over the years have been quite campy (RIP Adam West) so I would bet there would be many fans of Batman who would not see this as a problem.Where it does become a bit of a problem is when some characters act VERY out of character with minimal explanation as to why. Without spoiling anything, one scene in particular has a character act EXTREMELY out of character for what I have to assume is only for the sake of ""fan service"" (if you see the movie you'll know what scene I'm talking about). Combine this fan service with the campiness and you come away from this film feeling as if you just saw someone's fan fiction brought to life. Admittedly it's not really BAD fan fiction, but it is very AVERAGE fan fiction.Truthfully, even with all of that I could easily justify giving this movie a 7/10, or maybe even an 8/10 if you really enjoy camp. However, THAT ENDING THOUGH!!?!?! Without spoiling anything, the movie's ending is abrupt, overly silly, and anti- climactic. They really build up a character appearance and an epic fight, but the payoff is instead that the character leaves as soon as they arrive, a silly moment happens, and then the film pulls with a Looney Tunes-esque moment. It felt like suddenly Harley Quinn became the director and directed this final scene. It felt like I was trolled by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm. They might as well have played the movie out to the tune of Rick Astley's ""Never Gonna Give You Up"". I knocked two whole points off of my rating just for that ending!It should also be noted that there are two stingers in the credits: one that happens a few minutes into the credits, and another that happens after they have ended. Both are pretty silly. In addition, after the final stinger, there is a short interview/behind the scenes look in which Bruce and Paul and others are asked about the origins of Harley Quinn, a look at what her real-life sociopathic disorder would be, and just a description of her as a character. It's good, as good as or possibly even better than the movie that came before it... In fact, I added a point back onto my score because it was good. Admittedly it did feel a bit like they were justifying some of the poor decisions being made in this movie (including the fan service one...) but still cool to know!So overall, it's a very okay movie with some problems, but was still fun to see. 6/10"
Oculus,2013,6.5,"A recently released inmate from a mental asylum learns from his sister that the murders he was convicted of committing were actually orchestrated by a supernatural entity, the Lasser Glass mirror.","Even though it wasn't as scary or gory, as I wanted it to be. It still managed to creep me out and get on my nerves, with it's very creative and elaborate story and excellent performances from all it's cast. I really enjoyed the chemistry between the two younger actors played by Annalise Basso & Garrett Ryan, and the relationship they had as characters, which added a lot of heart and sentiment to the whole story. Moreover, this movie was more a drama with some horror, because it didn't played with the whole scare and gore factors, but instead it was more about the the story behind the mirror and the effect it had with the people that surrounded it. It would be a good idea to make this a franchise because of how extensive its universe could be, as well as how many different stories and characters it could incorporate and continue to haunt, even though it's ending was melodramatic to me, it felt conclusive and eerily heartbreaking. Overall, it was a very good little drama-horror film that goes more farther than you could imagine and think."
First Man,2018,7.3,"A look back at the life of astronaut Neil Armstrong and the legendary space mission that led him to become the first man to walk on the Moon on July 20, 1969.","Reviewers say 'First Man' is lauded for its realistic space travel depiction, strong performances by Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy, and intimate portrayal of Neil Armstrong's life. However, it is criticized for slow pacing, lack of historical context, and perceived inaccuracies. Some find it emotionally distant and less engaging. Despite mixed reactions, the film is noted for its visual and auditory realism, dividing audiences on its effectiveness as a historical and dramatic film."
Jexi,2019,6.0,"Phil makes top 10 pop lists at work. His only ""friend"" is cellphone Siri. His new phone includes AI helper Jexi, who improves/controls his social life.","I actually respect this enjoyable little trifle because it never promises or tries to be more than what it is: 80 minutes of mindless fluff/escapism. Sometimes that's all you need.I live in an EU country where this movie is not scheduled to be shown (if  is to be believed, I'd have to go to Hungary to see in it a theatre!). What we normally get from America in our big cinemas are the Hollywood big-budget comic-book/big-name blockbusters. I got coerced into seeing ""Ad Astra"" and ""The Irishman and hated them both.""Jexi"" is SO not my kind of movie! I tend to watch stuff from my country (the cerebral stuff; but we produce our share of crap, too) and our neighbouring countries, most of which is not in English and will never be shown in America except in Art Houses with subtitles.My favourite English-language films so far this year have been ""The Nightingale"" (Australia), ""The Lighthouse"" (Canada?), ""Jojo Rabbit"" (New Zealand?), and ""Official Secrets"" (UK).Most of them are rather dark/brutal (even ""Jojo Rabbit"" is not all comedy), so ""Jexi"" was just what I needed: to shut off my brain for 80 minutes. Some of the jokes are laugh-out-loud funny. I particularly liked one about Bernie Sanders. I'd never heard of Adam Devine (some of the reviews here really dislike his previous work; I was surprised to learn that he is 36 and has 63 credits , none of which I have heard of) and thought he did an above-average job with the screen play handed to him.Not everything can have Anthony Hopkins or Quentin Tarantino or Brad Pitt (wait: maybe everything CAN have Brad Pitt) or Robert DeNiro or Jennifer Lopez or Al Pacino, so these little five-million-dollar-budget movies have their place. Definitely not for everyone!"
The Flight Attendant,,7.0,"A reckless flight attendant with an alcoholism problem wakes up in the wrong hotel, in the wrong bed, with a dead man - and no idea what happened. Unable to piece the night together, she begins to wonder if she could be the killer.","Watched all 8 episodes in two sittings. I wasn't sure what the show was about so went in cold. The writing, directing and acting is great, so even when you think you know where its headed, there are enough twists and turns that you aren't sure anymore. For other reviewers who didn't like that she drank all the time, I'm assuming you've never known a functioning alcoholic with a traumatic childhood. They make poor decisions, can be self absorbed and narcissistic."
White Men Can't Jump,1992,6.8,"Two basketball hustlers, black Sidney Deane and white Billy Hoyle, join forces to double their chances of winning money on the street courts as well as in a tournament.","Recently seeing a trailer for a remake of this iconic but somewhat forgotten 90's film made me realise the original was long overdue a rewatch.It is more than just a sports film, it's a an evolution of the 'buddy' movies and 'odd couple' movies of 80's (think Lethal Weapon, Stir Crazy, Twins, Trading Places). So in effect it is about the relationship, and the chemistry between Snipes and Harrelson is excellent. You really feel for each character in their highs and especially lows throughout the movie, and wonder how they will scrape themselves out the next scam they create.The games scenes are really well shot with slo-mo action of the actors doing some cool skills and plays on the court, making me wonder how long they trained at basketball to prepare for this film!? The comedy element does not get overlooked either and the banter between the two leads is especially fun and does not feel forced. Also worth a mention is the scene of the store hold up robbery which is a genuinely funny moment.On the downside, It does feel a little dated now, from the court fashion to the scenes of the tough neighbourhoods and the assorted hustlers and gangs, you don't get the impression of any true danger to the interlopers. Also some of the stereotypes are quite cliched, but then the film is really based wholly on the one big stereotype of the title.Overall a good movie that is original and has a more genuinely fun interplay of characters than you might expect. A fun and somewhat underrated movie.7/10."
Hercules,1997,7.3,The son of Zeus and Hera is stripped of his immortality as an infant and must become a true hero in order to reclaim it.,"This is possibly my favorite Disney movie ever. With a razor-sharp wit, perfect comic timing and a fresh plot that transcends most other Disney fairy tales, this one's definitely a keeper.You'll be enchanted right from the first number, in which the five Muses (from Greek mythology) set the stage of ancient Greece in a powerhouse gospel number which gives a whole new meaning to a Greek chorus. Recalling the three ladies in Little Shop of Horrors or Motown groups like the Supremes, the Muses appear randomly throughout the movie to narrate the story of Hercules with jazzy musical numbers that you'll be humming for days. The songs (by Alan Menken) are certainly a twist from the classic Disney musical, but there's enough variety to create a great, well-rounded musical. The writing is the wittiest in any Disney movie ever, with constant in-jokes and hilarious references to Greek mythology to reward the amateur scholar. The lyrics, too, are witty and full of tricky rhyme schemes that must have been a doozy to write but play out perfectly on screen. (You'll be flat-out awed by how many things rhyme with the phrase ""gospel truth"".)Another of the highlights is the heroine, Megara or Meg. She's in no way a typical Disney princess. She's sassy, sexy, cynical and dangerous - and more winning by far than any warbling Cinderella or whiny little mermaid. The villain, Hades, is also a fun, witty character, although plenty dangerous in his own right.Of course liberties have been taken with Greek mythology. The dysfunctional Olympian family has been cleaned up (No more Zeus having affairs or Hera trying to kill people) and the story has little in it of the original Greek legend. Instead, it's really an archetype, a modern retelling of all the Greek legends at once. Appearances are made by the Muses, the Hydra, satyrs, the Fates, Pegasus, the Titans, Narcissus, and of course all of the Olympian gods. Scholars may take offense, but since legends evolve and are to be taken with a grain of salt anyway, I didn't have a problem with it.Yes, it's cheesy, just like other Disneys. But when nobody else is around, there's no resisting the corn. The third act is absolutely heart-wrenching, and even if it's over-the-top, it never truly goes over the top, and the constant bombarding of wit keeps things from getting too touchy-feely. Besides, tied together with a golden Disney score, who couldn't resist a dose of adventure, heartache, redeeming love, and most of all, heroism? Just let yourself be carried away to ancient Greece and you'll forget the movie's problems in a Pelyponnesian minute. As the Muses would say, that's the gospel truth."
One Hundred and One Dalmatians,1961,7.3,"When a litter of Dalmatian puppies are abducted by the minions of Cruella De Vil, the owners must find them before she uses them for a diabolical fashion statement.","One of the most lovely films of all,1001 dalmatians is one of the classics from Disney that all people should watch. I was surprised to know that it was made in 1961,because I watched it for the first time in 1993 (I was 7) and it looked a modern cartoon for me,such as Lion King.Pongo and Perdita (a couple of dalmatians) and their owners Roger and Anita, are living happily and peacefully in their new home,until Perdita give birth to some puppies: Cruela,the evil friend of Anita, wants to do a new coat,using the little dalmatian's fur. She kidnaps them,and now Perdita and Pongo needs to save their puppies,before being too late."
The Night Of,,8.4,"After a night of partying with a woman he picked up, a man wakes up to find her stabbed to death and is charged with her murder.","HBO's new crime drama 'The Night Of' has sucked me in right from the very beginning. The pilot starts up very slow but builds suspense as it starts to tell the story, and that's where it shines; in it's storytelling. It was dramatically convincing and had a pleasantly dark atmosphere.The pilot was very long (1hr 20min) but it felt much shorter, it was tense from start to finish, in the sense of the story it was actually very predictable, but it was the acting and how the story was portrayed that made it so gripping and watchable. Not a second went by where my attention wasn't glued to the TV screen.What really made me love the pilot was how REAL the story felt, there wasn't a moment that made me think that it was a stupid story, it felt REAL. The acting was superb by everyone, the cinematography was perfect with it's overall dark tone and lighting, and the music just set the scene playing in the background to the tone of the show.The overall mood of the show has been set for the series, and if it stays at this standard for the rest of the series it will be an ultimate success. I look forward to where the rest of this series takes us! No complaints yet!9/10"
The Road to El Dorado,2000,6.9,"Two swindlers get their hands on a map to the fabled city of gold, El Dorado.","What can I say?  The Road to El Dorado kept me hooked right from the very start, proving to be an amazing adventure filled with action, comedy, color, breath-taking imagery and music. After The Prince of Egypt, I wasn't too keen on another Dreamworks animated film.  Don't ask me why, but Prince of Egypt just failed to reel me in.  El Dorado on the other hand has restored my faith in the studio.I'll keep this short and to the point.  El Dorado seemed to deliver the goods in every aspect.  The music was great and certainly enhanced the mood and scene, Tim Rice and Elton John did a fantastic job with the instrumental score. The characterisation was done quite well, and you could really sense the strong friendship that Tulio and Miguel had with one another.  Chel was also a character favorite of mine, and Rosie Perez did a great job providing her voice! The artwork was also exceptionally good, with the colorful Mayan themes and designs providing an amazing backdrop for the story.  Of course the film is not without its fair share of eye-candy, the special effects were excellent and Dreamworks didn't go overboard with them. The story was also a nice change.  For once it wasn't the tired, rigid old formula of ""good guys meet bad guys, conflict, defeat bad guys and everyone's happy"".  I mean..sure everyone is happy in the end...and there is the token good guy VS bad guy routine but Dreamworks seemed to mince it up somewhat and introduce all-new elements.Surely it has its flaws, you say.  Well in all honesty, I'm hard pressed coming up with any.  I didn't exactly love the character design for Tulio and Miguel but that's just being incredibly petty....All in all, The Road to El Dorado was very refreshing and a welcome change from the usual Disney-formula-based feature.  As for comparisons and similarities with the ""brilliance of Disney"", I believe that there is no need for that talk.  I ask you, why do we need more Disney?  The Road to El Dorado shines in a light all of its own."
Batman: The Killing Joke,2016,6.4,"As Batman hunts for the escaped Joker, the Clown Prince of Crime attacks the Gordon family to prove a diabolical point mirroring his own fall into madness.","This movie is awful. As a stand alone movie, it's weak and ineffective. As an adaptation, it's a travesty.What should be a deep, poignant movie that reflects on the nature of good and evil, why we become what we become, whether free will exists and other fascinating themes, becomes a lame action movie full of fan service, bad writing, bad characterization and terrible pacing.This movie is doomed by a complete misunderstanding of what made the comic great, a bad writer and total lack of respect for its characters (especially Barbara Gordon).Everything great about the comic was done poorly or taken out. And all the additions are awful.A fan of the comic will hate it and a newcomer will just wonder why the hell the comic is considered a masterpiece, if this is the story people raved about for 30 years.Animation is decent and voice acting is good, so I gave it a 4/10 out of respect for those things.But this one of the worst things ever produced by DC."
Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark,2019,6.2,"Pennsylvania, 1968. After playing a joke on a school bully, Stella and her friends decide to sneak into a haunted house that once belonged to the powerful Bellows family, unleashing dark forces that they will be unable to control.","Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is the type of book that has most certainly made its impact. At the same time, it's also virtually impossible to adapt directly since it's a collection of short stories. While it would possibly work as an anthology horror, the movie takes a different direction and makes its own story that incorporates characters from the book's stories as villains. With horror maestro Guillermo del Toro as producer, it captures the essence of the book, which is good enough. All things considered, this is really more of an ode to horror as a genre, and to the things that scared us as kids. It incorporates several horror subgenres, which was a great addition. It has ghosts, zombies, body horror, and a monster sequence near the end. Popular characters from the book's terrifying illustrations appear, and they look fantastic. It has a great feel to it, and Del Toro's fingerprints are apparent in it. Unfortunately, it has some drawbacks. The main human cast is bland and forgettable. There's nothing here that you've never seen before. Overall, this is the type of movie that would be great if you're a kid and it's your first horror movie. However, if you were in elementary school when SSTTITD was at its peak, you'd be in your 30s at least in 2019 when this movie came out. Today's kids probably haven't heard of it (although who knows, I knew it growing up in the 00's). It ends on a sequel hook, curiously enough, so that may be on the horizon."
Anonymous,2011,6.8,"The theory that it was in fact Edward De Vere, Earl of Oxford, who penned Shakespeare's plays. Set against the backdrop of the succession of Queen Elizabeth I and the Essex rebellion against her.","The trailer to this movie interested me but it really beat my expectation. I thought it would be sort of interesting but overall dumb and super far-fetched movie. Now I can see how some people might dislike this movie, especially for those that are fans of Shakespeare. Also the movie doesn't really make you think but instead goes in a black and white direction. Where Shakespeare is a charlatan and a fraud, while being a obnoxious drunkard and a despicable person at that. Also this movie might irritate some viewers who judges movies by how true it is historically. Although history is written by ink and usually by the victors. But what this movie is, is a intriguing movie that grabbed my attention most of the way through although it had some slow moments. And can get a bit convoluted the way it goes from before and after parts, but you catch on after a while. Since there are movies about Shakespeare, it would have been more interesting if it had more of the back story of Earl of Oxford and his life. And also some parts seemed a bit far-fetched. The cast was pretty good and the acting for the most part is believable. Especially Rhys Ifans who played Earl of Oxford, the way he presented himself was charismatic and you could tell the character is intelligent by the way he expressed himself. Vanessa Redgrave was also great as Queen Elizabeth I. What was intriguing was how plays are in a way sort of like movies and this movie was about how plays moved people in immense ways. Overall this movie was a good blend of drama, romance and conspiracy.7.4/10"
The Midnight Sky,2020,5.7,"This post-apocalyptic tale follows Augustine, a lonely scientist in the Arctic, as he races to stop Sully and her fellow astronauts from returning home to a mysterious global catastrophe.","When writing a script, a book or creating any sort of story-telling medium, every scene MUST have a purpose to further develop the plot, characters, or atmosphere.The beginning of the movie starts well-enough. The pacing of the movie, atmosphere and the beginning of the plot is set. You fully understand what is happening and have a general idea of what challenges the protagonist might face. However, after about 30 minutes, the movie slows down. A lot.Each and every scene thereafter is meaningless to the viewer and useless to the film director. Every challenge the characters face is short-term and has nothing to do with the overall story (oh no, I lost my luggage!) It is only until the last 12 MINUTES of the movie, does the story advance albeit very little.After sitting through the movie for an hour and a half, I was debating on looking for another movie, but I stuck with it. If not for me, then for my readers.Pass on this movie. It's not science fiction, but more of a B grade movie with great sci-fi visuals. I enjoy slow-paced science fiction (Interstellar, Gravity), but this is not slow-paced. It's no-paced."
Apr√≥ mes√©k,2019,6.8,"Shortly after the end of World War II, a con man on the run finds himself in a passionate love affair that may well cost him his life.","Story based on classical pattern (two men and one woman), but very fresh, solid, neonoir, with great soundtrack and brillant micro twists."
Couch Surf,2014,5.3,If couches could talk - they would tell stories about a childish man on a time-out; an anxious patient of a sexy psychologist; an inept loser preparing himself for a date on women's day; a neurotic couple speculating about a mysterious stain; the former and the new owner of a thrown away couch; French hippies or three naughty teenagers stretching the boundaries of fri...Read all,
The Ninth Gate,1999,6.7,An unscrupulous dealer of rare books finds himself at the heart of a string of paranormal events when he is hired to find the last two copies of a text capable of summoning the devil.,"Tall order to make books scary, but this baby does it!  Also it has by FAAAARRRR the best and coolest 'meet the devil' scene EVER!  And no it's not some pointy guy with horns saying hello.  Watch the movie and you'll see... (damn I just got chills thinking about it).  OK OK I'll let you in on a secret - devil lives in the burning fire of destruction and is embodied in your lover (ok still doesn't make sense till you see the movie).Well Johnny Depp is a quite good actor I must say, and shooting this thingy all around Europe gives it a fresh 'travel channel' vibe while you go about chasing down demon relics and whatnot - even makes me long for a stay in some of those funky little hotels! :)  I must visit!  Maybe I shal meet El Diablo...This is a very VERY elegant horror movie.  NO bloody gutsy to speak of - but lots of good plot things happening and just all around very 'cool'."
Death to 2020,,6.8,"In mockumentary format, characters discuss events of 2020 with a mixture of true information and satire. The overarching topic is the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the US and UK.","I'm surprised at how many people don't love this. My girlfriend and I found it hilarious. Hugh Grant is terrific as a pretentious academic, Lisa Kudrow is dead on on a gaslighting White House spokesman, Tracy Ullman is a fun queen. The jokes are clever and funny and the movie does a solid job of sketching out the insanity of 2020.Ignore the naysayers, check this out. It's hilarious."
Sonic the Hedgehog,2020,6.5,"Taking refuge on Earth, when Sonic uses his incredible speed and accidentally knock out the power in part of the United States, he catches the attention of Dr. Robotnik and must stop him from using his unique power for world domination.","Which incedently for Sonic isn't an issue (he's fast you know). I don't know how much you know about the little Hedgehog and his game history, but even without any knowledge at all, the movie will make sense to you. Certain things, like the rings and hoarding them is one of the things you do when you play him .. wait that didn't came out wrong did it? I hope not, this is a childrens movie after all.Jim Carrey really relishes and dives into his evil character! He has quite the fun with him and a lot of interesting zingers/one liners. This is overall a funny and entertaining little movie. Is it flawed? For sure - should you care though? The movie won't be fun if you do! Now that does not mean that the studio doesn't listen! The first trailer had quite the catastrophic reactions from fans all over the world ... so back to the drawing board (I guess almost literally) and a new improved Sonic was developed ... nicely done! So sit back, relax and enjoy the ride (that has quite a few plot holes in it, but a lot of heart too)"
Doctor Sleep,2019,7.3,"Years following the events of The Shining (1980), a now-adult Dan Torrance must protect a young girl with similar powers from a cult known as The True Knot, who prey on children with powers to remain immortal.","Finally got to see my most anticipated film of the year and I'm happy to tell you it's everything I wished for and more. Flanagan has done an amazing job adapting the book from Stephen King and giving lovers of the Kubrick film adaptation of ""The Shining"" (1980) a cinematic sequel.
Now i read the book and while I enjoyed it for the most part, I found parts of it underwhelming. I feel in this film adaptation, Flanagan takes elements from the novel and manages to make them more darker and serious which in turn really helped address some issues I had with the book. He does make some serious changes though and while I embraced them I'm not sure how others who read the book will feel about them. ""The Shining"" (1980) to me and I'm sure a lot of you, is a masterpiece in filmmaking. I for one prefer it over the novel and with this film, it most certainly feels like a sequel to Stanley Kubrick's version and a love letter to that film. The last 30 mins or so are absolutely amazing and kudos to Flanagan for pulling it off.
Ewan McGregor does a great job as an adult Danny Torrance and Rebecca Ferguson captivates as Rose the Hat. The film sets a great tone with some stunning visuals and the score completely grabs you. How much you enjoy this film really depends on what you want out of it. There's practically no gore here and no cheap jump scares. What you'll get though is expert filmmaking from someone who you can tell really loves the source material he's pulling it all in from. Everything struck a balance for me that I was tremendously pleased with, top horror film of the year."
Taboo,,8.3,"Adventurer James Keziah Delaney returns to London during the War of 1812 to rebuild his late father's shipping empire. However, both the government and his biggest competitor want his inheritance at any cost--even murder.",Tom Hardy is one of the best actors on the planet...period. Besides maybe Leonardo DiCaprio he's my favorite actor and one of the handful of actors where I'd watch the movie/show knowing nothing more than that their in it! Taboo is another great performance for Hardy. It is thrilling from start to finish and can't wait until they finally make Season 2!
The Last Dance,,9.0,"Led by Michael Jordan, the 1990s Chicago Bulls establish themselves as one of the most notable dynasties in sports history.","Reviewers say 'The Last Dance' offers a comprehensive view of Michael Jordan's career, emphasizing his skills, competitive spirit, and basketball influence. The series examines Jordan's relationships and personal flaws, receiving acclaim for its interviews and footage. However, some critique its editing and narrative. It also delves into the Chicago Bulls' dynamics and Jordan's NBA era, making it essential viewing for basketball enthusiasts, despite mixed opinions on its structure."
Countdown,2019,5.4,"When a nurse downloads an app that claims to predict the moment a person will die, it tells her she only has three days to live. With the clock ticking and a figure haunting her, she must find a way to save her life before time runs out.","Honestly I was in the mood to be spooked, and that's what this movie did. It's all about jump scares, so if that's not your thing then I wouldn't suggest this movie. But I don't know why this movie is getting all these bad scores. If you want to be scared by jump scares and have some laughs then I suggest this movie"
The Art of the Steal,2013,6.3,"Crunch Calhoun, a semi-reformed art thief, agrees to get his old gang back together to pull off one last heist.","I decided to review this one because some of the other reviews are slightly miss leading. I do not pretend in any way to be a film critic... Just your every day regular movie goer/watcher, and as such I must admit I really really enjoyed this one. It has enough twists and turns to keep you hooked till the end and delivers a nice sense of humor throughout the whole movie. Yes, maybe the movie did try a bit too much to be a type of Guy Ritchie meets Ocean's Eleven, but I wouldn't necessarily say that's bad, and I wouldn't say it failed at it either. Bottom line, if you are considering watching it don't think it over too much, go for it and enjoy it, I guarantee it'll have you hooked into the first 10 minutes."
Dark,,8.7,"A family saga with a supernatural twist, set in a German town where the disappearance of two young children exposes the relationships among four families.","Reviewers say 'Dark' is a complex, thought-provoking show with intricate storytelling and time travel themes. The series is praised for its deep, philosophical questions and strong performances, especially the actors portraying characters across different time periods. Cinematography and eerie atmosphere enhance its suspenseful tone. Some find the slow pacing and complexity challenging but rewarding. Opinions on later seasons vary, with some finding them messy and others appreciating continued depth."
Death Note,2017,4.5,"A high school student named Light Turner discovers a mysterious notebook that has the power to kill anyone whose name is written within its pages, and launches a secret crusade to rid the world of criminals.","The other reviews are massively not enthusiastic: Even though I'm a huge fan of the eponymous manga, it seems like most of the other fans are disappointed, as a sweet euphemism, by this adaptation. Turning a 10-hours Japanese cartoon into a 90-minutes Hollywood movie is obviously a tough exercise. But, according to me, the result is nevertheless correct. Morality: movie to be watched, and eventually appreciated, BEFORE the manga."
Knock Knock,2015,4.9,"A devoted husband and father helps two stranded young women who knock on his door, but his kind gesture turns into a dangerous seduction and a deadly game of cat and mouse.","Set on Fathers' Day weekend, successful architect Evan Webber (Keanu Reeves) prepares for a weekend of work while his wife and kids enjoy a weekend at the beach. On his first night home during a rainstorm two young women Bel and Genesis (Ana de Armas and Lorenza Izzo) arrive at his doorstep asking for help. After he allows them in the two seduce Evan resulting in a threeway. After Evan's infidelity, the two reveal their true intentions wreaking havoc on Evan's home and life and subject Evan to increasingly intense psychological and physical tortures which may culminate in his death.Directed by Eli Roth Knock Knock is an uncredited remake of 1977s Death Game (though the original director and stars are executive producers). Knock Knock hits all the beats from the original while also updating the premise with references to contemporary society and technology. I honestly didn't like Death Game when I saw it because I found the plot repetitive and the characters annoying, but I did give it props for being a well made attempt by an inexperienced director and having a chilling performance from Sondra Locke. Knock Knock is certainly more polished of a product in terms of film making in comparison to its more grind house level predecessor, but while the package has been glossed up the content is considerably lesser this time around.The opening 40 minutes are easily the best part of Knock Knock as we establish Evan's sexual frustration and hectic family situation that build up to the seduction. It's honestly really well told and is much better here than it was in the original 1977 film where the wife and kids were basically non entities for much of the original film's runtime. The film is also well shot with great looking establishment shots of the house.Unfortunately beneath the coat of polish that's been applied many elements have been downgraded in terms of quality despite a supposedly more experienced director, Roth, helming the remake of a film that was made by an amateur. Keanu Reeves is a good actor, but only if given the right material. Reeves in Knock Knock does have a fun brief shining moments such as scene midway through the movie where he's trying to rebuke the advances of the seducers, but it feels like the role was written with someone like Nicolas Cage in mind and they just shoehorned Reeves into the role because they couldn't get him. Reeves still sporting his John Wick doo just doesn't sell it as a workaday family man and doesn't sell a role that he just doesn't fit into.Ana de Armas and Lorenza Izzo start off well enough as the seducers when they first arrive in the movie, but around the halfway point where they reveal their true intentions they become absolutely insufferable to listen to. Not only do they act like oversexed brats with middle school level vocabularies, they have this unearned sense of ""holier than thou"" moral superiority that makes them extra aggravating. While movies with killers with prideful moral superiority complexes can work, such as Kiefer Sutherland as The Voice in Phone Booth or Tobin Bell as The Jigsaw Killer in Saw, those movies at least had some level of self awareness that their killers were hypocritical scum doing ex post fact justifications of their actions. Knock Knock is more confused and feels like it muddled its intentions much like Nicolas Cage's Wicker Man remake where they replaced the Paganism/Christianity dynamic with a fundamentally confused masculinity/femininity dynamic. Roth tries to update the very 70s counterculture girls with updated equivalents for the digital age, but it comes off more as an excuse for Roth to amp up the annoyance of characters who were already pretty grating to begin with.Knock Knock is Roth at his worst. While it's not as bad as his worst movie, Hostel Part II, by virtue of at least being unintentionally fascinating in some confusing choices it's still an unnecessary remake of a very flawed movie that is not approved upon save for technical details. It's not completely without merit thanks to some decent cinematography and brief moments of good acting, but if you have a choice between this and the original, stick with the original, for all its flaws it at least had the excuse of an inexperienced director."
Birds of Prey,2020,6.1,"After splitting with the Joker, Harley Quinn joins superheroines Black Canary, Huntress, and Renee Montoya to save a young girl from an evil crime lord.","Reviewers say 'Birds of Prey' garners mixed feedback. Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn performance and dynamic action sequences receive high praise. Cathy Yan's energetic direction and Ewan McGregor's portrayal of Black Mask are commended. However, the film faces criticism for its disjointed plot, underdeveloped supporting characters, and inconsistent humor. Some find it messy and chaotic, with pacing and character development issues. Despite these flaws, many appreciate its bold approach and entertaining moments."
"Papa, sdokhni",2018,6.8,"Andrei, a detective and the world's most horrible father, brings together a terrible group of people in his apartment: his resentful actress daughter, an angry thug, and a cheated cop. Each one of them has a reason to want revenge..",This kept popping up at all the genre festivals so I had high hopes and was very impressed. Super violent and super funny. Had a very fun time watching this with a late night crowd.
Circle,2015,6.0,"Held captive and faced with their imminent executions, fifty strangers are forced to choose the one person among them who deserves to live.","This is a fairly simple movie, a bunch of people wake up in a strange room and are rapidly picked off one by one. However the kicker is that they get to vote off who dies next. I really enjoyed this, it felt like a reality show from hell.The film gets going almost right away, there isn't really any build up or character development before people start dying. As the group gets smaller we slowly start to get to know some of the characters, but no one main character is ever really determined. I like that they did this, it made it so it was pretty unpredictable as to who would die next. The film is also pretty heavy on dialogue, I am pretty surprised that they were able to find a fairly unknown cast that was able to pull this off well. The majority of the characters are believable and deliver solid performances.There are a few negatives that are worth mentioning though. One is that some of the kills were too random, it's pretty much like ""Why would they randomly kill that person when they could have easily killed the person who is clearly giving them a reason to do so?"" Not a huge complaint but just kind of took away from the film in my opinion. Also the ending was a bit stale, not so much to ruin the movie but wasn't exactly the payoff I was hoping for.Overall this is a very entertaining film, it held my attention throughout and actually had me on the edge of my seat a few times. If you enjoyed films like Saw and Cube I would definitely suggest checking this out.7/10"
Rocco,2016,5.7,"Rocco Siffredi is to pornography what Mike Tyson is to boxing or Mick Jagger is to rock'n'roll: a living legend. His mother wanted him to be a priest; with her blessing he became a hardcore performer, devoting his life to one God only: Desire. Rocco Siffredi reveals all, even if it sometimes means busting his own myth: his true story, beginnings, career, wife and chil...Read all","Many of the reviewers here were apparently expecting an hour and 45 minute long vlog by Rocco going about his daily life, which this is not about. Nor is it another sub-par ""I use to do porn but now I am an advocate against it"" type documentary.Its an artistic film about Rocco's past and present with a behind the scenes look into some of the scenes and how he feels about it all. How he began to dislike what he did when his family came along and his sons began to grow up.You also get to meet Kelly Stafford, a true unknowing victim of modern feminism, who basically needs to be choked and spit on during sex because she cannot meet a manly man in her real life. She aches for masculinity and dominance so she can succumb to her born-biological female need to be feminine and submissive.The scenes may come across as ""degrading"" to some, but with masculinity so lacking in this day and age, its what these performers and the female viewers truly want and you get a first hand look into that.This film digs deep into masculinity and femininity with a little background on the man so legendary for putting those very two things onto tape.With all that in mind, enjoy."
Coco,2017,8.4,"Aspiring musician Miguel, confronted with his family's ancestral ban on music, enters the Land of the Dead to find his great-great-grandfather, a legendary singer.","Reviewers say 'Coco' is celebrated for its stunning animation, vibrant colors, and intricate details, alongside soulful music, especially ""Remember Me."" Themes of family, memory, tradition, and Mexican culture, particularly the Day of the Dead, are highlighted. The storytelling is noted for its poignancy and excitement, often evoking strong emotions. Some praise the respectful and accurate portrayal of Mexican traditions, while others find the script and plot simplistic. The animation and visual spectacle are consistently lauded."
The Stepford Wives,2004,5.4,The secret to a Stepford wife lies behind the doors of the Men's Association.,"Charming Joanna (Nicole Kidman) is a successful and creative journalist of a TV channel , then she suffers a breakdown for a programme . She along with her hubby (Matthew Broderick) and children are moved from Manhattan towards the quaint little town of Stepford (Conneticut) , a very modern and upper class location . She didn't like the neighborhood with attractive and perfect but unintelligent housewives . She is concerned that many wives spend their lives in domestic slavery . Joanna early befriends a pair good friends (Bette Midler and John Lovitz). Meanwhile , her husband joins the mysterious Stepford Men's club (run by a powerful Christopher Walken and married another too perfect wife , Glenn Close) which takes place in an old Manor house . Joanna soon discovers there lies a dark truth about the strange and servitude behavior in the all female residents and the sinister secrets hidden in the Stepford town .The film is an amiable comedy with sci-fi , thriller elements and a little bit of drama . Heavily re-edited and re-written following test screenings , with new scenes shot and others deleted . The attempts to cater to audience tastes backfired as the new edits and scenes created continuity errors and major story problems . The casting is frankly well . Thus , a beautiful Kidman and good comedian actors : Broderick, Midler , Lovitz . Jolly and lively music by David Arnold . Special mention to colorful and glimmer cinematography by Rob Hahm . This new rendition is preferably a comedy , while the old version by Brian Forbes with Katherine Ross and Paula Prentiss was a chiller and considered to be very superior and being almost a classic film and followed three inferior sequels : ¬®Revenge Stepford wives ¬®, ¬®Stepford children¬®, ¬®Stepford husbands¬® . The film was regularly directed by Frank Oz . The picture will appeal to the gorgeous Nicole Kidman fans. Rating : Average but amusing ."
The Gentlemen,2019,7.8,"An American expat tries to sell off his highly profitable marijuana empire in London, triggering plots, schemes, bribery and blackmail in an attempt to steal his domain out from under him.","Reviewers say 'The Gentlemen' is a return to form for Guy Ritchie, praised for its humor, action, and star-studded cast. Hugh Grant, Matthew McConaughey, and Colin Farrell receive acclaim for their performances. The fast-paced, intricate plot and Ritchie's signature style are noted strengths. However, some find the story predictable and characters shallow. Opinions on originality are mixed, with critiques of reliance on Ritchie's past works. Despite flaws, the film is generally considered entertaining and enjoyable."
Locked Down,2021,5.3,"A couple attempts a high-risk, high-stakes jewelry heist at a department store.","I was wondering how long it would take them before they came up with a Covid movie and apparently it's not even that long as we're still right in the middle of it. The movie is as boring as the whole supposed pandemia. I guess they made it in the beginning of the outbreak as the measures still seem to be mild, not really what we are imposed to do now. Locked Down is too long, much too long. It's a lot of talking, a lot of uninteresting conversations.. And even though the cast contains some well known actors it's still a mediocre movie. You have to wait till the very last part to have some crime, but even that wasn't satisfying. If you want to watch endless conversations between Chiwetel Ejiofor and Anne Hathaway then this is a movie for you. If on the other hand you're sick of hearing anything about Covid just skip this one, I wish I did."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,2017,6.9,"Michael Bryce, a protection agent, is tasked with protecting Darius Kincaid, one of the world's most famous assassins.","Pulp fiction meets deadpool, not as intense as both films, but a great watch and very funny. Sarcasm all the way."
Tau,2018,5.8,"A woman is held captive by a scientist in a futuristic smart house, and hopes to escape by reasoning with the Artificial Intelligence that controls the house.","This movie isn't very original or groundbreaking, and it becomes a rather predictable ride about halfway through. But, if you can manage to suspend your disbelief just enough, that ride is still mostly entertaining.The acting is decent, although Ed Skrein's character is not very convincing as either a villain or a scientist. I felt the AI was lacking a bit in the ""I"" department and the interactions with it are mostly shallow.Visually it all looked very pleasing, although lacking in originality.All in all, this movie does feature a little bit of everything you might want to experience in a movie about AI. The action, the suspense, the drama, it's all there. And if you don't expect a masterpiece or blockbuster, you may find it very passable for what it is.7/10."
Underwater,2020,5.9,A crew of oceanic researchers working for a deep sea drilling company try to get to safety after a mysterious earthquake devastates their deepwater research and drilling facility located at the bottom of the Mariana Trench.,"I dont understand the low rating, movie is quick in getting into action, some Fantastic effects, set etc. Good thrill. Reminds me of 70 and 80s movie.Give this one a shot and you will not be disappointed."
Viktoria: A Tale of Grace and Greed,2014,6.2,"The Roma Viktoria leaves her home town of Budapest to earn the big money in Switzerland. Every night she finds herself as a prostitute in the back alleys of Zurich. Although surrounded by greed, fast sex and violence she also finds friendship, love and herself.","I pretty much missed the theatrical release, so I decided to buy this on DVD because I had really high expectations. Well... This is a story about Viktoria a really quiet gypsy girl from the slums of Budapest. She lives with her Brother (played by the Hungarian cult actor Kirst√≥f Horv√°th) and his family, I guess. Soon enough she gets fed up with the ""ghetto"" and her brother and decide to go to Zurich, Switzerland to score big as a prostitute as a last ditch effort... So, the directing is decent enough, the story is OK, the score and music of the movie is rather good, the performances of the main characters are stunning : Zsolt Nagy as Junior the pimp is fantastic, Erika P√∂l√∂skey""s performance as Marina the first lady (pimp?) of Junior is haunting, and of course Franciska Farkas is really good (and stunningly beautiful) as Viktoria. There are no other honorable mentions tho. So because of the premise of the movie I expected a really heavy drama, with revelations and character development. Instead of the richness of the subject matter Vikt√≥ria is a bit shallow on the story telling, we don't get to know her family (?) really well, we don't get to know her brother really well (which is a really big missed out opportunity), we don't get to know her roommate or even Viktoria herself... and so on. The movie does not go into details in general. In one word this is an unsatisfactory movie on many levels if you expect something with some depth and/or gravity."
Volt egyszer egy t√©ka,2018,7.6,A tearful but happy commemoration about the golden age of videotheques and the VHS format. The basis of the story is the closing of the Corvin theque after 22 years.,"An admirable documentary about those good old times when hell-bent moviegoers became VHS lovers. This funny and melancholic piece depicts the Hungarian version of Blockbuster video store (in Hungarian: Odeon Videot√©ka, a video rental store) spanning two decades of its existence. Not only were these video stores so popular in Budapest, Hungary, but they also formed a common ground both for intellectuals and average Joes. Odeon took a village to raise the spirit of community."
Saw III,2006,6.2,Jigsaw abducts a doctor in order to keep himself alive while he watches his new apprentice put an unlucky citizen named Jeff through a brutal test.,"i decided, just as it was getting dark, that i was going to watch saw 3, and with much anticipation (after the first two), i did just that. the movie opens up, alike the first - reintroducing the bathroom, so i wasn't feeling too bad.the movie's a tad confusing, and i spent more or less, the whole time trying to keep the vomit down in my stomach, so that didn't leave me with too much mentality to make sense of the whole reminiscent, nostalgic, deja-vu way the storyline was written.the whole, disgusting gory, blood thing just isn't my style of horror. thumbs up for the excellent twists though! definitely, not for those with a faint heart, or a weak stomach. maybe my anticipation of the first two, brought my hopes up a bit too high, but it really wasn't as fantastic as i expected.go and watch it though, only if you've seen the first two."
1917,2019,8.2,"April 6th, 1917. As an infantry battalion assembles to wage war deep in enemy territory, two soldiers are assigned to race against time and deliver a message that will stop 1,600 men from walking straight into a deadly trap.","Reviewers say '1917' is acclaimed for its technical prowess, especially the one-shot cinematography and realistic portrayal of World War I. The film's intense emotional impact and strong performances are frequently highlighted. However, some critics feel it lacks originality and depth, drawing comparisons to other war films. Concerns about plot simplicity and underdeveloped characters are noted, although the visual and technical elements are universally praised."
Midsommar,2019,7.1,A couple travels to Northern Europe to visit a rural hometown's fabled Swedish mid-summer festival. What begins as an idyllic retreat quickly devolves into an increasingly violent and bizarre competition at the hands of a pagan cult.,"Be first thing I wanted to do after leaving the cinema, was to discover what the swedish thought of this film, in general they saw it with humour, and an open mind, as I expected.It's pretty much split right down the middle, first half, dare I say it, normality, drama, with a heavy focus on grief, and the harsh way it can affect someone, particularly if there's trauma involved. The second half is very trippy, and we delve into the world of pagan ritual and bizarre rights, which makes The Whicker Man look like a tea party.The main leads, Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor, were terrific. Pugh had impressed previously in The Little Drummer Girl, it was obvious she was destined for big things, she played Dani with a real sense of torment, very impressive. The cast had a realism, it was refreshing not to watch a cast that look set for a Dior catwalk.It won't be for everyone, and I must point out that some scenes are painfully long, needlessly. Some amazing special effects.Violence and nudity, but neither are gratuitous or simply for shock. A few laughs, several times the cinema erupted in laughter.Very good. 8/10"
Jigsaw,2017,5.7,Police search for a supposed to be dead killer who forces his victims to play sadistic games of life and death.,"It was a good movie, thrilling, good mystery-puzzle and all that. I am a fan of the Saw series, I just don't see a reason why make a sequel to that and continue it while unnecessary and ruin the ''legacy''! And from what I can gather there will be Jigsaw 2 3 etc. It is a good movie, but not as a Saw sequel.
Otherwise I recommend watching it to Saw fans.
PS: The graphic works could be better."
The Old Guard,2020,6.7,"A covert group of tight-knit mercenaries with an inability to die have fought to protect the world for centuries. But when their abilities are suddenly exposed, they need to eliminate the threat of those who seek to replicate their power.","I really wanted to like this film. It's got a simple but fun premise and it's got Charlize Theron, who's a fantastic actress. But the film is just marred by plot holes, cliched characters, tacky dialogues and hands down the most inadequate music possible for this film.It's still a passable action film if you have absolutely nothing else to watch."
I Care a Lot,2020,6.4,A crooked legal guardian who drains the savings of her elderly wards meets her match when a woman she tries to swindle turns out to be more than she first appears.,"This Marla character is just pure vile evil, in a bad way, nothing cunning or intelligent. The plot holes are just too annoying to ignore, it edges to simply terrible filmmaking. Acting is top notch, though, but the story and ""non-antagonist antihero"" aspect fail miserably."
25th Hour,2002,7.6,"Cornered by the DEA, convicted New York drug dealer Montgomery Brogan reevaluates his life in the 24 remaining hours before facing a seven-year jail term.","As 'A Spike Lee Joint,' 25th hour is a paradigm, filled with Lee's typical style and directorial vigor. A flowing, feature length music video, containing a story that is coherent, topical and, above all, strongly analytical in its approach to the characters, 25th Hour is the story of mid level drug dealer (Monty Brogan ¬ñ Ed Norton) whom, on his last day before being incarcerated for his elicit trade, must make peace with his family and friends, answer to his Red Mafia suppliers, say farewell to the city he so obviously loves and, ultimately, accept that he is now in receipt of justified dues.With a post 9/11 setting in NYC, the script deviates from the book (which was written pre-9/11) only slightly in order to encompass the destruction, yet the atmosphere is set with the opening credits and a slice of dialogue during the first quarter (followed by some beautifully filmed cutaways to a sodium lit nighttime clean-up crew, working in Ground Zero) which leaves the audience with no alternative but to associate the main characters' desperate tableau with plight of the city in the aftermath of tragedy. This could perhaps beg the question: What was so bad about how Monty made his living to warrant the end of his life (in effect) in the 25th Hour?This is a question answered before it's asked, with the first scene after the opening credits showing an exchange between Monty and a disheveled wreck of a man who is quite clearly one of his customers. It's further reinforced in a later flashback to Monty's earlier days as a dealer when the same man approaches Monty dressed in business attire. The destruction of others for personal gain is something that will not - and quite rightly so - go unchallenged.A subplot concerns blame, where Monty vilifies and accuses everyone in the city, himself included. However, later in the film, the injustice of this is rectified with a simple shot of the various people, looking upon him with sympathy ¬ñ the personification of this being a small boy offering a sign of friendship. Monty's own redemption begins and is represented by him expressing his brotherhood to the child in return.Relying somewhat on symbolism and hidden meanings, there are a number of subtexts, as well as ample opportunities to read into the narrative more than is intended, but the overall message is clear: culpability is in the hands of the bearer, and with his last 24 hours of freedom sifting away and the eponymous 25th Hour quickly approaching Monty must see that blame can only lie with himself.25th Hour's greatest achievement is in relaying a subtle, but highly relevant parable in a manner of storytelling that is both enjoyable and compelling. Very few words are wasted and the dialogue remains taught and muscular throughout. The editing, acting, score, direction and cinematography are all of the very highest standard. It could've been very easy for a film of this nature to fail by being presented as an embarrassing lecture. Thankfully 25th Hour is definitely no lecture, but a powerful and haunting movie."
The Boat That Rocked,2009,7.3,"A band of rogue DJs that captivated Britain, playing the music that defined a generation and standing up to a government that wanted classical music, and nothing else, on the airwaves.","Entertaining. Hilarious. Cheesy at moments and not always historically accurate, but so uplifting! A solid feel-good film. That's how I would describe ¬ÑThe Boat that Rocked"". The film is set in the late 60s and its story follows young Carl, who is sentenced by his mom to go live on a ship, where his uncle works. As he steps on board, he takes a spin on a carousel ride that will flip his life upside down. The ship shelters an illegal radio station, its eccentric DJs and a few other, but, just as important, characters. As Richard Curtis is a well known director, he's managed to gather one of the most exceptional casts I've seen for a while. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bill Nighy and Nick Frost add another great performance to their list of already impeccable work. Tom Sturridge, supposedly the main character of the film, is a new discovery. You can see that the cast had great fun filming this movie. The one thing that makes this ride truly rock is the music. If you haven't fallen in love with the 60s music, you will after this film. The Kinks, The Rolling Stones, Leonard Cohen, The Who and Jimi Hendrix, these are just a few of the artists which form its amazing soundtrack. Many diss this film for its historical inaccuracies, for the partly anachronistic music that is used. This film is flawed, no doubt. There is no revolutionary message hidden in it or a strong plot. And it weirdly consists of mainly subplots. Despite all that, the film makes you want to join the cast dancing on board. It is a film of friendship and love. It is lighthearted and makes you smile like a dork even at the cheesiest moments. Even its very predictable ending doesn't take away much of that. I dare to say that this film will give energy to both the young and the old. Do not watch it for the plot or in search for accurate facts. Watch it for the characters and the emotions. Just lay back and enjoy the party."
The Honeymoon Phase,2019,4.5,"Struggling young lovers, Tom and Eve, must endure a 30-day scientific experiment. Room, board, $50,000 and a month alone together in research facility housing. What could possibly go wrong.","I give this one star because of the obviously fake reviews.It is exasperating that producers/directors/or whoever resort to this stupid tactics.
A film is expected to stand on it's own merits, and if whoever makes film can not tolerate public opinion then they shouldn't be in the business.if public opinion is poor then filmmakers should learn from it and improve their art - not try and create some false delusional perception they have of themselves."
Adaptation.,2002,7.7,A lovelorn screenwriter becomes desperate as he tries and fails to adapt 'The Orchid Thief' by Susan Orlean for the screen.,"After the phenomenal success of 'Being John Malkovich' in 1999, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman was commissioned to adapt Susan Orlean's non-fiction novel, ""The Orchid Thief,"" for the screen. However, it didn't take long for him to realise that Orlean's book was basically unfilmable, its sprawling and ponderous story lacking any clear structure or coherence. After some months of struggling vainly to write a screenplay from the novel, Kaufman's script inexplicably became the story of a writer's effort to adapt an unadaptable novel. Kaufman's completed script was presented to his financial backers with some trepidation, but they reportedly loved it so much that they decided to abandon the original project and film his screenplay. Spike Jonze, who had also directed ""Being John Malkovich,"" returned to direct ""Adaptation,"" the quirky, twisting, self-referential film that received almost universal critical acclaim. Much like Federico Fellini's classic 1963 film, '8¬Ω,' from which Kaufman almost certainly drew inspiration, 'Adaptation' tells the story of its own creation.Nicolas Cage plays Charlie Kaufman, the lonely, insecure and socially awkward screenwriter who is hired to adapt ""The Orchid Thief,"" written by Susan Orlean, who is portrayed by Meryl Streep. The novel itself concerns the story of John Laroche (played by Chris Cooper), a smug plant dealer who was arrested in 1994 for poaching rare orchids in the Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve. As Kaufman struggles to write the script, his troubles are compounded by the presence of his twin brother, Donald (also played by Nicolas Cage), who is Charlie's exact opposite: reckless, carefree, over-confident and perhaps even a bit dim. The script for 'Adaptation' darts back and forth between different moments in time, either chronicling Kaufman's screen writing exploits or Orlean's experiences in writing her novel. At several points in the story, more dramatic flashbacks take place: we see Charles Darwin first penning his theories of evolution and adaptation, a brief history of the grim activity of orchid-hunting, and, in one particularly impressive sequence, we are taken back billions of years to the beginning of life, to trace how Charlie Kaufman came to be here today.Though purportedly based on a true story, the events of the film are highly fictionalised, and the story always treads a fine line with reality, with the audience never certain of whether or not an event is real (in the context of the film) or merely a creation of Charlie's (or even Donald's) imagination. Charlie Kaufman (the true-life writer, not the character) often receives most of the accolades for the film, but it is director Spike Jonze who shared the vision to execute ""Adaptation"" on screen. His approach to film-making is always original and daring, never tentative of trying something unique for the sake of the film, even if it may offend the tastes of an audience that is unaccustomed to anything other than the mundane clich√©s of the modern movies that are churned out daily by Hollywood studios. If this wasn't completely obvious after the weird, twisted, fascinating 'Being John Malkovich,' then 'Adaptation' put any lingering doubts to rest. The director, who started his career directing music videos, seems to share a singular understanding with Kaufman the writer, and a mutual agreement on what the film is actually trying to say.In addition to a clever story, 'Adaptation' contains some of the finest acting of the 2000s, presenting an excellent selection of seasoned talents at the top of their games. In arguably the greatest role(s) of his career, Nicolas Cage is phenomenal as both Charlie and Donald Kaufman, twin brothers whose complete polarity is startlingly evident in the execution of their respective film scripts. Charlie, whilst writing his adaptation, is determined to avoid the usual clich√©s and construct a film without any conventional plot, to write a movie ""simply about flowers."" Donald, however, blissfully oblivious to his own unoriginality as a writer, churns out a hackneyed psychological thriller, entitled 'The 3,' in which the serial killer, his female hostage and the cop are the very same person. In an ironic twist of fate, Donald's trite treatment is hailed as a masterpiece, adding further to the inadequacy already being felt by his disillusioned brother. Cage is excellent, and often absolutely hilarious, as both characters, giving each brother a distinct attitude and personality, so that it is possible to tell immediately which is which even though their physical appearance is exactly the same.Meryl Streep is equally excellent as Susan Orlean, the journalist for ""The New Yorker"" who researches John Laroche and endeavours to catch a glimpse of the famed and very rare Ghost Orchid, if only to understand what it feels like to be passionate about something. Chris Cooper arguably steals the entire show as the charismatic and enigmatic Laroche, whose tragedy-afflicted life is dedicated to mastering numerous obscure fields (such as orchid-collecting, or fish-collecting), each of which is sporadically cast aside and permanently forgotten as soon as he feels it's time to move on, to ""adapt"" to another hobby. From four Academy Award nominations, only Cooper walked away with a statue. Notably, Charlie Kaufman's screenplay was also nominated for an Oscar. Since the script was credited to both ""Charlie Kaufman and Donald Kaufman,"" the latter became the only entirely fictional person in history to have been nominated for an Academy Award.In a nutshell, 'Adaptation' is all about failure. Charlie Kaufman is absolutely determined to write an original script, without cramming in ""sex or guns or car chases or characters learning profound life lessons or growing or coming to like each other or overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end."" However, after he eventually asks Donald to complete the script for him, it descends into exactly that. A visit to a screen-writing seminar by Robert McKee (memorably played by Brian Cox) ¬ñ who is famous for warning strongly against Deus Ex Machina ¬ñ is used as exactly that. Charlie Kaufman the character fails miserably in writing his script, but, ironically, Charlie Kaufman the writer succeeds ever so magnificently!"
The Lovely Bones,2009,6.6,Centers on a young girl who has been murdered and watches over her family - and her killer - from purgatory. She must weigh her desire for vengeance against her desire for her family to heal.,"Adapting a film from a source material that is anything but intended for cinema is always a tricky thing to do. Judging by the largely negative criticism this film received, Alice Sebold's novel by the same name is apparently gutted by director Peter Jackson. Apparently, because that is exactly what some mainstream critics seem to think. On the other hand, I have not read Sebold's novel. As such, I think it's safe to assume that my experience may have been better than those who did read her book. Even so, I'm sure my experience was a lot better than those who read it and watched the film with the sole intention of harshly comparing one to the other. Even J. K. Rowling has her fair share of 'haters' when you talk about what Harry Potter does on screen, as compared to what he does in one of her books. So the next time you decide to lash out at a film maker for not living up to your novel (pun unintended) experience, think for a minute what it would be like to watch a movie, adapted word for word from the novel it's sourced. Even if you read one page at the rate of one minute, how would a 300 or 400 page novel translate into a 300 or 400 minute movie? Even if that were possible, what good would it be if the source material was not altered for the screen? And why shouldn't it be, given that both mediums are limited in creativity.So coming back to the subject on hand, and since I did not read the novel, I can say without a pause, that the movie experience was decent enough to have had me glued to the screen from beginning to end. In her narrative, Saoirse Ronan (pronounced Ser-Sher) explains her character's tragic end and what happens after. As Susie Salmon, Ronan portrays a time in America when ""do not talk to strangers"" was an unheard-of caution; a time when children could roam freely and not have to live in fear of preying eyes. Sadly enough, talking to a stranger was the last thing Susie Salmon did, before being murdered, dismembered and never to be found again. But this is where her story begins, first discovering her own death, then being stranded between her overwhelming feeling of vengeance towards her murderer and watching her family suffer and tear apart during their untimely loss. It is at this juncture, or the ""in-between"", as she calls it, where Susie shockingly learns that she is not the first, but the most recent victim in a series of brutal murders.Questionable by some critics, is Jackson's use of strong visual effects in portraying Susie's transition into the ""in-between"". After ""King Kong"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, we see why Jackson is well endowed in the CGI department. That said, even having Steven Spielberg sign on as executive producer could not have influenced Jackson into telling Sebold's story in any other way but his. Visuals are crisp, abstract, and fluent while his color palette is deep yet intense with contrast, resulting in images that will push your Bluray player and HD display to the max. Is it needed in a murder mystery? Not really, because the plot is not much of a mystery; it is an innocent 14 year old girl's narration of the after-life. Again, this is where cinema CGI has the edge over raw imagination, especially when reading a book. As far as mystery is concerned, there is none. After school one day, Susie doesn't reach home because she has been lured into an underground den, specifically engineered to entice under aged girls. Her last moments are spent with her captor, a seemingly average Joe. Playing this monster is the versatile Stanley Tucci in what has to be one of his best roles thus far, deservingly earning his first Academy Award Nomination in a supporting role. Although his offering is top notch, you can't help but notice the utter darkness oozing out of his character. If the eyes are windows to the soul, then Tucci does an exceptional job as George Harvey, complete with that unmistakable flicker of evil in his eyes. Other supporting roles come from Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz as Susie's parents and Susan Sarandon as her grandmother. As always, Whalberg's rage-filled scenes are intense, but very rarely are his characters helpless. For the first time here, we get to see a combination of both. Sarandon's Grandma Lynn is questionable as this character does not add to the plot, nor can her inclusion be considered a sub-plot. But if there is ever a light moment throughout the film, it does come from Grandma Lynn. Another key character is played by Rose McIver as Susie's sister and in doing so, offers some of the film's intended suspense.This film succeeds as a drama. As a thriller, it could have been better. Comparing internet reviews between the book and the film will tell you that Jackson has chosen to leave the gory details out to get a wider audience. Although there are no actual scenes of rape, murder and mutilation, the act is heavily suggested during parts of the film and this is why it has a PG-13 rating instead of an R."
Shooter,2007,7.1,"An expert marksman living in exile, is coaxed back into action after learning of a plot to kill the president. Now on the run after being double crossed for the assassination attempt he was trying to prevent, he sets out for the real killer, and the truth.","23 March 2007. Warning: Spoilers. I can't say I was impressed with the ending, but most of the movie was involving and interesting. This solid action thriller is held together by Mark Walberg and contains the classic ""Three Days of Condor"" suspense and chase as well as the ""The Bourne Identity"" sophistication to make an overall nice thriller. Of course Walberg's near escape from death has already been pointed out as being a bit suspicious but the aftermath is handled about as well as any movie I've seen. There is a good interweaving of two characters trying on different tracks to solve this mystery, though its final explanation isn't as nefarious as some movies, more like ""The Interpreter."" While not in the top flight class of thrillers like ""Bourne Supremacy,"" this movie definitely adds to the quality of this genre. Seven out of Ten Stars."
Shot Caller,2017,7.3,A newly released prisoner is forced by the leaders of his gang to orchestrate a major crime with a brutal rival gang on the streets of Southern California.,"i don't think i can really express how good this film is in words, but ill do my best...Its about more than just a man screwed by life, it about loyalty and family, and where you will ever go to protect those you love.I must say, this one is on my top 3 of the year. Brutal and deep film that touches you."
Deadly Illusions,2021,3.8,"After a bestselling novelist suffering from writer's block hires a new nanny for her children, the line between fiction and reality starts to blur.","I'm so upset that this movie had to be this bad. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't boring but it was almost entertaining to watch how bad its plot and acting were.I mean, the villain CAME OUT FROM NOWHERE. The story of the mother being a writer is almost useless. There was no correlation between the character and the conflict. The motives and background were definitely not in sync with the plot it meant to give.The acting was not helping either. When they supposed to be happy they didn't look sincere, when someone supposed to be in shock, they didn't even do what people supposed to do when they're shocked.I personally don't recommend it but go watch it if your day is so good and you need to balance it out by feeling upset a little bit."
The Magnificent Seven,2016,6.9,Seven gunmen from a variety of backgrounds are brought together by a vengeful young widow to protect her town from the private army of a destructive industrialist.,"You sit down, ready for an old-school, sweat-soaked, gunpowder-packed western, and instead, you're greeted with a team of mercenaries that looks more like the cast of Fortnite than the Wild West. Denzel Washington as a Black cowboy hired by an entire town without a single racist redneck raising an eyebrow, a perfectly diverse set of characters, and even an Indigenous warrior who's not a walking stereotype. At this point, it's less of a western and more like an illustrated brochure from the UN.Don't get me wrong, I'm all for representation, but these historical inaccuracies hurt. These are characters who, historically, would probably be at each other's throats. Instead, they're cooperating like it's a special Dora the Explorer western edition. A bit of casual racism is thrown at a few Asian characters to tick a box, but otherwise, everything's running as smoothly as a community picnic. The historical realism here has about the same credibility as Greta Thunberg giving a keynote speech at an oil industry convention.Luckily, the cast itself is rock solid. Denzel Washington? Still the king. The man could play a scarecrow and radiate charisma. Chris Pratt does his usual jokester routine, and surprisingly, it works. Vincent D'Onofrio plays a gruff giant with a smoker's rasp that'll make you crave straight whiskey. Honestly, the actors carry the film, and they don't disappoint.The plot? Simple: bad guys show up, terrorize the town, and our seven mercenaries come in to light them up. It's a basic premise, and that's okay. Antoine Fuqua isn't trying to reinvent the wheel, and that's actually refreshing. Sometimes a western just needs guns, horses, and a final standoff to work. The structure is classic: gather the team, prepare for battle, and end with a grand, chaotic shootout. It's clean, efficient, and it smells of gunpowder.Let's be honest: no one came to this movie looking for a deep narrative or Oscar-winning writing. We wanted epic gunfights, burning saloons, and bad guys dropping like bowling pins. And on that front, the film delivers. The final showdown is a beautifully orchestrated mess of whistling bullets, galloping horses, and bodies hitting the dirt like a Red Dead Redemption heist gone horribly wrong.The Magnificent Seven is like a big, greasy hamburger: it doesn't innovate, but it satisfies your craving for action. Don't go searching for moral depth or a profound lesson. If you want a modern western that sticks to the basics and entertains, you're good to go. But if you're a John Wayne purist, be prepared to grit your teeth."
Yes Day,2021,5.7,A mom and dad who usually say no decide to say yes to their kids' wildest requests with a few ground rules on a whirlwind day of fun and adventure.,"Ok, I'll make this very straightforward. This is the ideal film if you are a parent looking to spend a nice evening with your kids. The story is simple, easy to follow, somewhat funny at times and very charming for young audiences. I cannot stress enough how this is a movie meant to watch with kids and is unlikely to be satisfying for teens and adults. Overall, this is an ""okay"" movie and you should not watch this film expecting anything extraordinary."
Zack Snyder's Justice League,2021,7.9,"Determined to ensure that Superman's ultimate sacrifice wasn't in vain, Bruce Wayne recruits a team of metahumans to protect the world from an approaching threat of catastrophic proportions.","Reviewers say 'Zack Snyder's Justice League' is lauded for enhanced character arcs, particularly Cyborg and Flash, and a darker, mature tone. The extended runtime allows for a richer narrative and better pacing, with improved action sequences and menacing villains. However, some find the film overly long and self-indulgent, with unnecessary scenes and criticized slow-motion sequences. Despite this, many view it as a significant improvement over the 2017 version, showcasing Snyder's vision for the DC Universe."
Operation Varsity Blues: The College Admissions Scandal,2021,6.9,Reenactments drive this documentary investigating the mastermind behind a scam to sneak the kids of rich and famous families into top US universities.,"This story made me sad, frustrated, and furious all at once."
Red Eye,2005,6.4,"Lisa on her flight to Miami befriends Jackson who turns out to be a terrorist. Holding her hostage, he forces her to help him assassinate the United States Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security.","The film talks about two people(Rachel McAdams,Cillian Murphy) who meet one night very late in the airport,catching a Red-eye.The story is the worst plane ride you could ever take.The place on the airplane where everything is compressed but that really contributes to the sense of claustrophobic,creeping terror, it's this struggle ,all contained within the coach section of the plane. This is the story of the worst person you could sit next to on a plane.The excitement is generated out of this compelling conversation between two individuals that start off innocent enough but then suddenly devolves.The psychological mind-play between these two characters and what it is to have to sit in one spot and be terrorized and basically held hostage,she and his father(Brian Cox) without letting anyone else know what's going on.Wes Craven said that he was attracted to this project ,first of all for the remarkably constructed script written by Carl Ellsworth.Thus the characters are complex,when you think you know what's gonna happen something else happens and the fascinating idea is that you never know who who you're going to sit next to on an airplane.The screenwriter does a character piece,and ,in a way ,maybe he creates a hybrid of the independent character film and Hollywood action blockbuster,thus we can have a character-driver piece,but also have suspense,thriller,action elements in it as well.The movie was filmed principally in Los Angeles.All of the airplane shot were on a set,but there was no way in hell one could shot this on a real airplane.Craven had an airplane that could take apart,it could pull sections off of the side and it could pull out panels and have a camera swoop down aisles and go up over people.Production design by Bruce Miller worked for Craven on many films,he creates splendidly the scenes that he needs to tell the story,the look of movie is just wanted to keep it as real as possible.He decided to go with the two-three seating pattern which is a 767 airplane and took pieces from many airplanes and put them together in this format with overhead baggage compartments,lighting,the seats and various pieces.We have a feeling you're in this capsule at 30.000 feet in the air .There's one shot where we see a tiny plane going through these huge clouds banks and you have the feeling they're in this tiny ship in the middle of nowhere.It's the old horror film thing of all these things happen in the middle of nowhere. The motion picture displays a colorful cinematography by Robert Yeoman and atmospheric musical by Marco Beltrani.The film is magnificently directed by the master of terror Wes Craven ."
The Good Liar,2019,6.7,"Consummate con man Roy Courtnay has set his sights on his latest mark: the recently widowed Betty McLeish, worth millions. But this time, what should have been a simple swindle escalates into a cat-and-mouse game with the ultimate stakes.","It's not an overly bad film by any sense of the word, I actually enjoyed it a fair bit hence the 7 but I will echo that it was a fairly predictable job but the outstanding cast definitely carried it, I'd recommend it if your on the unlimited cinema deal or when it arrives to one of the multiple streaming services, good twist at the end"
The Perfect Storm,2000,6.5,An unusually intense storm pattern catches some commercial fishermen unaware and puts them in mortal danger.,"While watching this movie, I kept imagining if this was how horrible it was for those people when this true story really happened.  By the end, my heart went out to all of them.  It was a good portrayal of what may have happened, and I enjoyed it immensely."
Catch-22,,7.7,Limited series adaptation of the classic Joseph Heller novel. Follows Captain John Yossarian and airmen in World War II.,"This series captures the essence of Joseph Heller's anti-war novel which I've read many times. Mike Nichol's tried to do so in his 1970 film, but fell short because of, in this viewer's opinion, the limitation of two hours not being enough time to adapt the novel. I believe the novel is a brilliant commentary on the lunacy of war as Heller saw it, which was ahead of it's time. This dark dramedy does an exceptional job displaying the satire and insanity that is expressed in the novel. This series has excellent direction, settings, soundtrack, costume and acting. However the cinematography is outstanding as well as the writing of Michod and Davies. All of the actors deliver superlative performances. In particular Abbott, Laurie, Stewart and Pullman stand out. Clooney's limited time in the series as Lieutenant Scheisskopf is worth it. His dialogue delivery, facial expressions and gesticulations are absolutely priceless. The same goes for Chandler as Colonel Cathcart throughout the series. The plot is set during WWII in Italy and revolves around a squadron of bombardier pilots with the central character being Yossarian A.K.A. Yo-Yo. He is the one man that seems to understand how egregious his situation is and the war is in general, pun intended. With the Germans retreating, Yo-Yo figures out that by convalescence he can get out of completing his required flight missions which starts out at 19. This is where Catch-22, which was coined by Heller, comes into play. Catch-22 is a diabolical military rule which states that if a man declares he is insane to get out of duty, well then he must be a sane man because you'd have to be crazy to fly bombardier missions to begin with therefore you are sane and you can't be discharged from duty. Essentially for all you readers that are unfamiliar with the phrase, it is a situation that is impossible to get out of. To top this off the maniacal Cathcart keeps upping the number of missions needed to complete one's duty and it always happens when a man is just a few missions from completing his duty. The series has all of the main characters from the novel; Yo-Yo, Cathcart, de Coverley, Scheisskopf, Milo, Aardvark, Nurse Duckett, Major Major Major ( that's not a typo) and more. The series does a marvelous job examining certain characters such as de Coverley as he navigates the war in the background as sort of a neutral character who hides in plain sight, Mess Officer Milo as he escapes flying missions by becoming a war profiteer, Major Major Major Major as he gets by solely because of having a name that was given to him as a practical joke by his father and Nurse Duckett who is on Yo-Yo's side but sees right through him.. As the missions grow from 19 to 25 to 30 to 55 the stakes get higher for Yo-Yo as he continues to try to find ways to beat the bureaucracy such as flying 11 missions quickly and handing in paperwork all at once before the missions can be raised again. We see the men during down time tying to enjoy a normal life during the most sinister of times. The series scrutinizes what lengths men are pushed to during the stress of war time and what lengths they'll go to in order to rid themselves of the madness. There are so many memorable quotes and scenes in the series. If I had to choose a quote it is when Scheisskopf asks a stenographer to read me back what I just said and the stenographer replies, ""Read me back what I just said"". The look on Scheisskopf's face is uproarious. My favorite scene would have to be when Cathcart is berating the squadron on how they missed this huge target in Rome only to have one of the men point out that it is Vatican City. The series is crisp, insightful, captivating, cathartic, duplicitous, gritty, daft, certifiable and blazing. In this viewer's opinion the series does a pronounced job in adapting the novel and respectfully conveys Heller's message. Catch-22 is beguiling and superior in the dark dramedy genre."
The Others,2001,7.6,"In 1945, immediately following the end of Second World War, a woman who lives with her two photosensitive children on her darkened old family estate in the Channel Islands becomes convinced that the home is haunted.","The Others is a very remarkable film from more than just one viewpoint. In an era where you can only impress young horror fanatics with bucket-loads of blood and gross-out effects, Amen√°bar actually re-teaches his audience that fear is especially caused by suggestion and the absence of explicit images. The Others is the first intelligent horror film in years, completely relying on atmosphere and eerie set pieces. It's such a relief to finally see a subtle film that is also effective! I'm normally not much of Nicole Kidman fan but she's very convincing as the prudish, over-concerned mother who desperately tries to protect her children from the outside world (daylight in particular). She lives in a remote mansion and waits, along with her 2 children, for WWII to be over. With the arrival of 3 servants, strange events star to occur in the old house and the daughter spots 'intruders' everywhere. The screenplay - by Amen√°bar himself - is not totally unique (filmfreaks who're familiar with expressionism highlights from the 60's will quickly guess the hidden plot twist) but it's filled with ingenious findings and sublime dialogues. The Others reminds you of 'The Innocents' and there are far worse films to get compared with, if you ask me! What also is rather amazing about this production is that Amen√°bar seems so confident! This is his first giant Hollywood adventure with stars in the cast and American money and yet he has total control over everything. The acting is great, the plot actually scares you and the directing is solid. The Others is a total winner and easily one of the greatest genre-films of the last few decades."
Seveled,2019,6.2,"Neither with you is a real romantic comedy about Gergo, a Hugh Grant-like intellectual man whose mother is having a serious heart disease and has only days left, and therefore she is obsessed with having a grandchild. To make his moms last hours happy, Gergo asks his ex-stripper, five-month-old pregnant neighbor, Saci to visit his mother in the hospital with him, and ...Read all","The premise is good, but there are some tired stereotypes and plot holes along the way. But still, an enjoyable movie, even with its flaws."
Wonder Woman 1984,2020,5.3,"Wonder Woman finds herself battling two opponents, Maxwell Lord, a shrewd entrepreneur, and Barbara Minerva, a friend-turned-foe. Meanwhile, she also ends up crossing paths with her love interest.","Reviewers say 'Wonder Woman 1984' garners mixed reactions. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine's performances are lauded, alongside Pedro Pascal and Kristen Wiig, though Wiig's role divides opinions. The 1980s setting and visuals are praised, yet the plot and pacing face criticism for complexity and sluggishness. Action scenes fall short compared to the first film. Themes of greed and morality are appreciated, but execution is deemed inconsistent. It's seen as inferior to the original, with varied enjoyment levels among viewers."
V√≠kend,2015,5.8,A hunting party of three in Transylvania. The carefree and rich people enjoying themselves. A shooting accident change the scene.,"This film from central Europe is certainly interesting and well directed, with fabulous locations of the Carpathians mountains. It could have used DELIVERANCE, STRAW DOGS or even MOST DANGEROUS GAME, very easily with such settingsd especially characters, rednecks characters. At first that's what I thought, that seemed exciting. But instead of that, we find some kind of thriller drama, a blackmail within blackmail topic, a bit complex, but not uninteresting however. This is a very hard to find film and worth watching, not a crap straight to DVD. I am sure there are many of this kind remaining in vaults or distributors warehouses. From time to time, it's good to watch them."
A Rainy Day in New York,2019,6.4,A young couple arrives in New York for a weekend and meet with bad weather and a series of adventures.,"It's true that Woody Allen is writing silly dialogue that's completely old-fashioned and way above the heads of any youngster in New York, and it's true that the story here is completely silly and motivations are way off. But it's somehow a charming way to spend a couple of hours. Elle Fanning is kooky and does her best to be a chip off the old Diane Keaton block. Timothee Chalamet is dreamy and solid but doesn't get enough clout. I'm not fond of the huddle of middle-aged film lotharios jumping all over Fanning, and I don't think Selena Gomez had enough sharp lines. However, it's another study from Allen of New York as a live character taking over the people in it and sweeping them along. Cherry Jones is extremely well-cast as the mother with a secret and Allen saves the best till last.
I probably won't watch it again for a long time, not one of his best but not the worst either. It's a shame that Netflix have done what they did to Allen. Not just for him, but the hundreds of names that rolled past in the credits of all the cast and crew who worked so hard on this movie to have it junked in the US, who did nothing to deserve this. Thank god I live in Europe where art is respected, and we have the intelligence to separate the work from the artist. I look forward to the next one to come out."
"Play It Again, Sam",1972,7.6,"A film critic obsessed with Casablanca (1942) seeks to get over his wife leaving him by dating again with the help of a married couple and his illusory idol, Humphrey Bogart.","What could be cooler than having a screen legend hanging out with you, offering you dating tips? This classic 1972 comedy written by and starring Woody Allen gives him two, one the specter of Humphrey Bogart, the other a young Diane Keaton just working her way into film.Woody plays Allan Felix, a film critic who has just been dumped by his wife and sets off to fill the hole in his heart. ""I'll get broads in here like you wouldn't believe,"" he tells himself. ""Swingers, freaks, nymphomaniacs, dental hygienists."" But when even the nymphomaniac complains about his getting fresh, he realizes it won't be so easy. Enter Bogart, appearing in a series of fantasy sequences, and Keaton, very much a part of his real life as one-half of the married couple that jumps in to help Allan out. Alone amongst women, she can see Allan as a worthwhile guy, especially with their shared love for apple juice and Darvon.""Play It Again, Sam"" is a bit of an anomaly for an Allen comedy. It's set in San Francisco, not New York, and is directed by Herbert Ross rather than Allen himself. But it's very funny, kind of poignant, and a clever way of examining the foibles of hooking up, circa the 1970s. A number of comic vignettes examine the various ways seeking out the opposite sex can go wrong, on the dance floor, in a Chinese restaurant, in a bar. My favorite has to be the museum hottie with the pneumatic voice: Only an Allen movie would have its best punchline be about committing suicide.The central point of the film, as brought out by another apparition only Allan sees, his ex-wife, is that the world is broken up into watchers and doers, and Allan the film critic is too much the former. Bogie gives him much the same advice, but Bogie and the ex-wife don't exactly get along in Allan's daydreams, leading to awkward moments. ""Don't listen to him!"" ""Don't listen to her!"" ""Fellas, we're in a supermarket.""Besides, as Allan notes, it's one thing for Bogie to get slapped, another thing for him: ""Your glasses don't go flying across the room.""Other than ""Annie Hall"" and ""Sleeper,"" this is the best of the early Woody Allen comedies, another way of saying the best of Woody Allen. Ross's unpretentious style keeps the focus on the humor and the performances, and even makes Allen seem a gifted physical comedian, which he isn't. Keaton is a terrific foil for Allen, both platonically and as it turns out, otherwise, while Tony Roberts as her husband (this being his first of many Allen films, too) makes for a wry straight man with his constant phone calls and his appearances in some fun fantasy send-ups, the best of them in Italian.You really like the characters in this one. Empathy can be a powerful weapon in comedy, something Woody apparently forgot as he moved into his Bergman phase. The ending is neat without being satisfying, the dream sequences aren't used to their full potential, and some of the rape jokes sound really bad all these years later. But you laugh a lot watching this film, a nice vehicle for Woody's observational humor and for seeing the game of love played in its most ineptly enjoyable form."
Brave New World,,7.0,"In a utopia whose perfection hinges upon control of monogamy and privacy, members of the collective begin to question the rules, putting their regimented society on a collision course with forbidden love and revolution.","Good production, good acting, great conceptual themes. Pacing is excellent. Sound tracking is excellent. Very binge-able. It's set in the brave new world setting, but its it's own story. Don't expect a re-make of the book."
Richard Jewell,2019,7.5,"Security guard Richard Jewell is an instant hero after foiling a bomb attack at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, but his life becomes a nightmare when the FBI leaks to the media that he is a suspect in the case.","I'm not a real fan of slow paced long movies... unless they are made by Mr. Eastwood. He captures every tense moment, facial expression, or still scene, and manages to fill in more about the story he is telling. Casting was perfection! Paul Walter Hauser needs awards for his performance. Kathy Bates and Olivia Wilde were on point, as was Sam Rockwell and Canadian wannabe Jon Hamm - who is awesome in his TV commercials lol! Directing was perfect, cinematography great, score in line, and the writing was good. Very enjoyable film and I recommend it. It's a well deserved 9/10 from me"
Mare of Easttown,,8.4,A small-town police detective tries to keep her professional and personal lives separate while investigating the death of a teenage mother.,"Kate Winslet is an outstanding actress and the other actors are right at her level! The storylines are intriguing and have kept me tuning in each week. BRAVO HBO! I really appreciate how Kate portrays REAL WOMEN - the good, the bad, the ugly - without apologies or compromises."
Ava,2020,5.5,"Ava is a deadly assassin who works for a black ops organization, traveling the globe specializing in high profile hits. When a job goes dangerously wrong she is forced to fight for her own survival.","Ava is one of those films that is enjoyable, but will quickly be forgotten. It doesn't have any major or glaring flaws, but equally it doesn't have anything extra special that makes it stand out.I absolutely love Jessica Chastain as an actress, and so she was the highlight for me. I thought she brought a good performance to a character who, despite not being too developed, had enough to maintain my interest.The story felt very familiar. If you're into the action genre, you won't find anything ground breaking here. That's not to say it wasn't enjoyable. It was fun to watch, it just hasn't left a lasting impression on me.In terms of the action, once again it was exciting, but it wasn't anything new. There were some pretty decent set pieces and some good fight choreography, and the action was well paced throughout.Ultimately I'm happy I watched Ava. It kept me entertained for an hour and a half, and at the end of the day isn't that why we watch films?"
Things Heard,2021,5.3,A woman begins to suspect that her home harbors a dark secret.,"This is a good horror/mystery movie but it could've been much better. It has a beautiful gothic atmosphere but it's not scary at all so if you're expecting a creepy horror film just skip it, it's does great with respect to the mystery part though. The story is really interesting, provoking and has a great implied message but the movie fails in portraying it, the screenplay has holes and feels weak sometimes. It's also unnecessarily long and boring at certain moments. Things Heard & Seen is neither great nor bad, give it a try if you like this genre and forget about it the next day."
Death of Me,2020,4.4,A vacationing couple must discover the mystery behind a strange video that shows one of them killing the other.,"Wow! Just finished watching this movie. Had 0 expectations, ended up really being entertained! Sure, some parts could've been done better, but it kept me interested till the end."
Pesti balh√©,2020,3.8,"After their friend dies in an accident, Marcell, the rich but burnt-out architect and the rest of his loser childhood buddies decide to team up for the last time to fulfill their friend's last wish by smuggling his crappy painting into the most prestigious art auction of Budapest.","The first minutes were okay when we saw the children stealing the drawing, but watching some 40years old losers still crying over their miserable lives and messing up a funeral is not funny. The whole concept of placing the painting in the auction and how the characters deliver it is absurd. Most of the scenes don't make any sense. The actors are terrible, the story is simple without any excitement or suspense and the jokes are written by 6year olds and we saw it a billion time. This movie would have been better if the characters had been younger and this stupidity would make a bigger sense. I am sad if this the post Andy Vajna era."
Creed II,2018,7.1,"Under the tutelage of Rocky Balboa, newly crowned heavyweight champion Adonis Creed faces off against Viktor Drago, the son of Ivan Drago.","This movie is not as good as the first Creed. It felt like a remake of Rocky 3 and was just too formulaic. However what made the movie for me was the final scenes where my appreciation of the movie changed by simply seeing the final round from the perspective of the Dragos and the aftermath of the fight with the Drago's.Adonis is done for, his story arc is ove and I don't want there to be more for him. He is happy and complete. Rocky's story is now done too. But Ivan and Viktor Drago were the only interesting people in this movie. And I simply want to see what happens to them both now after this ending.I want to see them pick up the pieces and be successful. They've earned it after the ending which was unheard of in a movie of this type.Please Sly and Dolph make it happen."
Stowaway,2021,5.7,A three-person crew on a mission to Mars faces an impossible choice when an unplanned passenger jeopardizes the lives of everyone on board.,"Zoe (Anna Kendrick), David (Daniel Dae Kim), and Marina Barnett (Toni Collette) launch into space on a two year trip to Mars. Less than a day after takeoff, a 'Stowaway', Michael (Shamier Anderson) is found in an access panel and with his discovery, the life support systems begin failing. It becomes a race against time to find a way to survive aboard a space craft without enough oxygen for four people.The acting is fairly well done and the script is predictable, but entertaining. The flow is solid and the ending is satisfying, but a lot of questions are raised about the validity of the science around the film. Why do certain plot points need to happen? This film feels a lot like 'Gravity' (2013), in that it's enjoyable if you don't think too much about it.Worth a once over."
Horns,2013,6.4,"In the aftermath of his girlfriend's mysterious death, a young man awakens to find strange horns sprouting from his forehead.","I think Daniel Radcliffe has damaged his career, he IS Harry Potter he took a role made it his own and it is now very difficult to see him as anything else.When I heard about this R rated title of his I had little interest but knew one day I'd get around to it. What I didn't realise was just how much I was going to enjoy it.Horns is nothing particularly special, but it has it's merits and I can confidently say I walked away satisfied with what I had watched.With a fantastic cast, a gripping storyline and a really quite neat ending I'm not entirely convinced Radcliffe will break free of the Potter curse but this was a good start.The Good:Excellent storyJuno TempleDavid MorseThe Bad:The ""Potter"" curse was certainly presentThings I learnt from this movie:Where Is My Mind? is officially on every movies soundtrackJuno Temple is allergic to clothing"
Thunder Force,2021,4.6,"In a world where supervillains are commonplace, two estranged childhood best friends reunite after one devises a treatment that gives them powers to protect their city.","I watched this thinking Melissa, Octavia and Jason wouldn't betray me with some crappy, predictable comedy. I was wrong. I mean, it's not unwatchable but it's definitely not worth a rewatch. Just put it on to play when you go out so the dogs have some background noise to distract them from chewing your furniture."
Mr. Brooks,2007,7.2,A well-respected businessman is sometimes controlled by his murder and mayhem-loving alter ego.,"The real star of this drama is the story, and the script. Costner's portrayal of a highly complex, sometimes tortured, character is superb in that he is seemingly always in control, always one step ahead of the challenges. One of the best stories in some time, this one covers all of the bases in a satisfying way, keeping the viewer completely involved from start to finish. There are just enough plot twists, blended seamlessly with just the right amount of predictability, to make this story completely believable, and totally satisfying.Mr. Brooks, Mr. Citizen, is a soft spoken, highly intelligent man of the community, always in control of his job and family, despite the adversities he faces throughout the movie. Very enjoyable is the intricacy, detail, and discipline he is able to maintain throughout the chaos that befalls him throughout the entire plot. His total control of all of the challenges almost makes him a super hero in terms of skill and control in the performance of his self assigned, gruesome tasks at hand. The blending of his alter-ego, bad conscience side, Marshall, is seamlessly accomplished in this psychological escapade, to the point that one almost has to root for ""them"". Marshall, although the psychopathic side of Brooks, is almost likable, in a twisted sort of way. The ongoing dialog between the two is perfect, in that almost everyone can relate to conscience issues at some point in their lives.The added sub-plots concerning detective Demi Moore, the would be wanna be killer Mr. Smith, and the ex-gold digging husband and his attorney, are extra, intriguing elements that are very well done. Though told with a considerable dark tonality because of the theme, one finds himself cheering for Mr. Brooks and his incredible ability as a master craftsman. Ironically, one can also cheer for the detective that is out to capture him.If you are ready for a story that is intriguing, suspenseful, gripping, and present day, then this movie is a good place to start. Costner, Moore, Cook, and Hurt are all splendid. Each one is intense, tormented, fun, and believable in his respective role. Another positive feature about the storyline, and it's conclusion, is that it lends itself to, perhaps, a very interesting sequel potential. Kudos to the directors, producers, and entire cast."
Mulan,2020,5.8,"To keep her ailing father from serving in the Imperial Army, a fearless young woman disguises herself as a man and battles northern invaders in China.","Reviewers say 'Mulan' has mixed reception. Positive reviews highlight stunning visuals, strong acting, and cultural authenticity. Critics praise Liu Yifei's performance and the film's attempt to stay true to the original story. However, many negative reviews point out the lack of emotional depth, weak storytelling, and departure from the original animated film's charm and humor. Some viewers are disappointed by the absence of iconic elements like songs and Mushu. The film's pacing, action sequences, and character development also receive criticism."
Napsz√°llta,2018,6.2,A young girl grows up to become a strong and fearless woman in Budapest before World War I.,"Greetings again from the darkness. Hungarian filmmaker Laszlo Nemes mesmerized us with his first feature film, SON OF SAUL (2015), the Oscar winner for Best Foreign Language film. That debut was an incredibly unique viewing experience centered on the Holocaust at Auschwitz. Mr. Nemes got much of the band back together for this follow up, and their collaboration, while a bit frustrating to watch, is again quite fascinating to look at.Mr. Nemes co-wrote the script with his SON OF SAUL writing partners Clara Royer and Matthieu Taponier (also the film's editor). And for those that share my frustration in watching the film, it's the story that is likely to blame. Is there a story? Certainly not in the traditional sense - which makes it difficult to follow or try to explain. Irisz Leiter (played by Juli Jakab) is first seen being fitted for fine hats in the elegant shop that bears her family name. We soon learn her parents both died, and she has been absent from the city for many years. The new owner, Oszkar Brill (Vlad Ivanov, 4 MONTHS, 3 WEEKS AND 2 DAYS, 2007) is startled to learn of Irisz's return, though we aren't sure why he is so uncomfortable around her. Irisz soon discovers she has a brother (a surprise to her) and that he is quite notorious in these parts.Much of the film focuses on Irisz trying to track down her brother, and then track him down again. That's the closest thing to a plot we get. Mostly it's a succession of scenes where people ask questions that never get answered. In fact, there is minimal dialogue to go with the now-familiar camera work of cinematographer Matyas Erdely who utilizes his SON OF SAUL first person perspective with background fuzzed out so that we see what one person is seeing. There is an underlying theme of what is apparently a corrupt part of a mysterious sub-culture in the society - even involving the Royal family. Keep in mind this is 1913 Budapest and war is at hand.The set design and costume design are extraordinary ... especially the lavish hats from the era. The score is from Laszlo Melis (also from SON OF SAUL), and while Ms. Jakab is pleasant to look at, the story is disorienting and unfulfilling. The approach with the camera work is designed to force us to see things through the characters' eyes, but it's not enough to offset the incoherent and aimless wanderings of Irisz as she collects scraps of information that may or may not be pertinent. Perhaps you are smarter than I am, and will be able to connect the dots ... or at least find dots to work with."
Army of the Dead,2021,5.8,"Following a zombie outbreak in Las Vegas, a group of mercenaries take the ultimate gamble, venturing into the quarantine zone to pull off the greatest heist ever attempted.","I'm not usually a fan of Zack Snyder's movies, but I do enjoy his visuals from time to time - maybe he should just stick to directing and leave the writing to those who know how to actually write a good movie with some interesting characters because this movie is just downright bad."
Clueless,1995,6.9,"Shallow, rich and socially successful Cher is at the top of her Beverly Hills high school's pecking scale. Seeing herself as a matchmaker, Cher first coaxes two teachers into dating each other.","Reviewers say 'Clueless' is celebrated for its witty satire of 90s teen culture, clever adaptation of Jane Austen's 'Emma', and iconic performances, especially Alicia Silverstone's portrayal of Cher. Common themes include social standing, high school drama, and character transformation. Criticisms often point to reliance on stereotypes, predictability, and the controversial romantic subplot between Cher and her stepbrother. Despite mixed opinions on its depth and lasting impact, 'Clueless' is frequently praised for its humor, style, and cultural significance in the 90s."
Denmark,2019,6.2,A down-on-his-luck Welshman travels across Europe with one crazy goal: to get himself arrested and sent to a Danish prison where the beds are warm and the water is hot.,A well thought through & written piece. The acting is excellent.It has that classic bitter sweet kitchen sink social commentary.So many in Wales (& other parts of the UK) face a desperate situation like the lead character. The film makes you face society's flaws with a back rub rather than a fist.
F√©lvil√°g,,7.1,"The story of three women - a famous prostitute, her housekeeper and their new maid - living in Budapest of 1910s, whose passionate, bizarre and complex relationship can only lead to one thing: murder.","The Hungarian film F√©lvil√°g was shown in the U.S. with the translated title Demimonde (2015) (TV). It was directed by Attila Sz√°sz.This film has been called a mystery. In the opening shot, the body of a nude woman has been found floating in a wicker basket on Budapest's Danube River. It's true that we don't know the identity of the woman because we just get a glimpse of the body. And, of course, at that point we don't know who killed her. However, the solution to the murder isn't the point of the film. The point of the film is the interaction among three strong, determined women. Also, as expected, it's about the status of women in Budapest in the early 20th Century.Three brilliant actors play the three leading roles: Laura D√∂br√∂si plays a young woman named Kat√≥, who is accepted as a maid by the housekeeper R√≥zsi (Dorka Gryllus). Both women serve Elza M√°gn√°s (Patricia Kov√°cs), a famous courtesan and now a kept woman.The plot is complicated, because R√≥zsi tells Kat√≥ that she was once more than a housekeeper. She and Elza were once best friends. Kat√≥, although poor and homeless, is stronger than we think she is at first. She's honest and religious, but she's also aware of the intricate and subtle intrigues that surround her.Obviously, any movie that begins with the discovery of a dead body isn't going to be a lighthearted romp. However, I found this movie to be particularly depressing while watching it, and that mood persisted after the film was over.On the other hand, Demimonde was brilliantly acted, crafted, and photographed. I've been to Budapest in the spring, but not in winter. Even now, and even in the spring, it's a relatively cheerless city. In winter, and with WW I looming ahead, it's a dark, foreboding venue. The cinematographer, Andr√°s Nagy, sets the mood of the film. My compliments to him for his outstanding work.Demimonde has an excellent 7.4 IMDb rating as I write this review. That high rating is richly deserved. It's a film you don't want to miss, assuming you can accept the grim opening scene and the dark 88 minutes of movie that follow that scene. Great filmmaking doesn't always make you happy.We saw this movie at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It was shown as part of ImageOut, the Rochester LGBT Film Festival. It's one of 22 movies that had its East Coast or New York State debut at ImageOut. What an outstanding festival this is--Rochester is lucky to have it."
"Endings, Beginnings",2019,5.6,"A 30-something woman navigating through love and heartbreak over the course of one year. During that time, she will unlock the secrets to her life in a sudden turn of events and in the most surprising of places.","This movie terribly lacked substance and excitement. Nothing happens except kitschy texts on the screen every five minutes and the next thing you know, Daphne slinks out of one guy's arms and runs into the other's, only to turn back to the first one again in a jiffy. I'd expect a movie with Jamie Dornan to have a lot more verve and zest, to be honest. What a shame."
The Boy: Bramhs' Curse,2020,4.7,"After a family moves into the Heelshire Mansion, their young son soon makes friends with a life-like doll called Brahms.","At one point I was like "" Is something going to happend ? "". I asked myself that 1 hour into the movie knowing they had only 25 minutes left to finished with something that makes sens.
The first movie really had an impact on me because I was not expecting the end at all and I was hoping to have the same feeling about this one. Or at least something that make sens with the end of the previous one. But I feel like they used the easy way out with that predictable ending."

Whiskey Tango Foxtrot,2016,6.6,"Stuck in a rut, a reporter decides to shake things up by taking a dangerous assignment in Afghanistan. Far from home and out of her comfort zone, she discovers her true strength as she risks it all to find the next big story.","A real gem of a film that you shouldn't miss. I saw the trailer and immediately felt the need to see though I had my reservations about Tina Fey in a black comedy/drama film. Guess what! Tina surprised me with her performance (not acting-wise, but presence-wise). I know this doesn't make any sense, but picture an actress shining in a movie without an over the top performance, not an easy job to do. Whether Tina has grown to be great at many genres OR the movie was simply destined for her real life character.The story-telling and events flow like nobody's business and the representation of Afghan People in the movie is beyond great. The movie balances between realistic approaches and the mainstream Hollywood agendas.I really recommend this film to all kinds of viewers."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,,8.4,"Comedy series following the exploits of Det. Jake Peralta and his diverse, lovable colleagues as they police the NYPD's 99th Precinct.","Reviewers say 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine' is acclaimed for its humor, ensemble cast, and character growth, especially in early seasons. The show is lauded for its diversity and handling of social issues with a light touch. However, some critics feel later seasons, particularly the final one, became too political and lost comedic charm, shifting focus from entertainment to social commentary. Despite this, 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine' remains a standout sitcom with memorable moments and a loyal fanbase."
Bill & Ted Face the Music,2020,5.9,"Once told they'd save the universe during a time-traveling adventure, two would-be rockers from San Dimas, California find themselves as middle-aged dads still trying to crank out a hit song and fulfill their destiny.","We have to face facts, the reason there are so many sequels and remakes of movies from the 80s and 90s is because Hollywood peaked then. The 2000's marked the beginning of the decline, which has been rapidly descending in the last few years.
Despite this decline and despite the mediocre Force Awakens style influences in the script, the charm and humour... and of course the nostalgia saves this from being unwatchable, which is high praise.
Zazz as the robot steals the show along with the woman from Flight of the Concordes but I mostly left feeling a little sad that this movie wasn't made in the 90s and sad that Keane Reeves may not actually be immortal."
Knuckledust,2020,4.8,"A former marine is trapped in an elite underground fight club. When cops swoop in they discover only one man left alive, him. But all is not as it seems. Is he the sole survivor or a mass murderer?","Or at least this is what the writer/director was probably dreaming his movie's reviews would sound like. Unfortunately the entire film is derivative and badly made, despite a cast with fantastic potential. Maybe the story is not that terrible, but it was telegraphed since the first few minutes. Then the killeresque stylish mystique, complete with individual quirks, contrived dialogues and complicated rules that don't mean much at the end. It would have been great if it would have been accompanied by good action scenes. Alas, they were shot from odd angles, cut at wrong places and censored for PG-13. This could have been a decent film with better actor direction and good editing.Bottom line: it's not a terrible film, but it is a failure compared with its goal and considering the untapped potential of the cast. There are other films that merit your attention more."
Little Women,1994,7.3,"Jo struggles for independence and sometimes clashes with her beloved mother and sisters Meg, Amy and Beth. She also contends with their cranky Aunt March, their impulsive neighbor Laurie and kindly linguistics professor Friedrich Bhaer.",This film is so tearjerking and heartwarming. This is my first time watching it and I adored it. I may have to go and read the book now to see how it compares.
Man on the Moon,1999,7.4,The life and career of legendary comedian Andy Kaufman.,"Your fondness for `Man on the Moon' may well be predicated on your feelings for Andy Kaufman, both as comic performer and offstage human being.  And, as this film suggests, there was not, ultimately, a very wide gap between the two.  Indeed, the point of the film seems to be that, with Kaufman, the many characters he showed to us on stage and T.V. pretty much reflected the man who existed in real life.This may be both the strength and the weakness of the movie itself. Kaufman's purported genius has always eluded me.  Ostensibly, it lay, I imagine, in his metaphorically giving the finger to his audience while entertaining them at the same time.  That audience, ultimately discovering that it was the butt of the joke, then was able to go a step further and become a willing part of the act, allowing them all to feel superior to the uninitiated masses still deluded enough to be on the outside looking in. Kaufman's act became, then, a kind of exclusive comic club, a collective act of defiance against the social norms of theatrical convention and good taste.  Thus, we see him in the film reading the entire novel `The Great Gatsby' verbatim to a stunned and ultimately hostile college audience; we see him wrestling women while spouting inflammatory chauvinistic rhetoric and deliberately muffing his lines on live national television in a brilliant blurring of the line between reality and theatricality.  The problem, however, is that iconoclasm has never been a source of humor in itself, and much of Kaufman's act and persona came across as heavy-handed, smug and self-conscious, particularly in his grating Lithuanian `Taxi' character.  In short, Kaufman always seemed too full of himself and so dazzled by his own cleverness and cuteness to ever be truly funny.  It was like he was always pointing his thumbs back at himself saying, `Look how funny I am.'  Such unctiousness inspires us not to laugh.The film itself is an uneven study of the man.   The first half is particularly shaky.  After a clever 5-minute view of Kaufman as a performance-obsessed child, we move to his young adulthood where we see him bombing in a local nightclub with an act so aggressively unfunny that we cannot even imagine that it could possibly be real.  Then, virtually in the blink of an eye, he is discovered by his future manager, again, in a scene of staggering incredibility, in which Kaufman somehow manages to reduce his audience to helpless laughter with material that couldn't possibly evoke even titters let alone room-shaking guffaws.  Before we know it, Kaufman has somehow landed a hosting job on `Saturday Night Live' (yet another bad performance) and has become so much in demand that he not only secures a role in a new sitcom, `Taxi,' but is allowed to make all sorts of demands from the producers in exchange for his services.  The chronicle of his meteoric rise to fame simply lacks the detail necessary to make it credible.The movie finds surer footing as it moves ahead in time.  If anything, the gross lack of humor of many of his performances recreated for the film simply underlines the overrated comic gifts of Kaufman himself.  Although the writers, Scott Alexander and Larry Karasczewski, and director, Milos Forman, convey an obvious attitude of affection towards Kaufman, they do not shy away from portraying the self-centered petulance that governed many of his actions both in his professional and personal life.   The most poignant moments come when he discovers he has lung cancer, yet cannot convince many of the people who are closest to him that he is really sick, so skeptical has his life of duplicity made them.  Though Courtney Love is very good indeed as the woman who learns to love Kauffman, the portrayals of her character and their relationship as a whole remain sketchy and superficial throughout.  We never really sense much chemistry between them since they never seem to experience much in the way of revelatory conflict.  She simply loves him unconditionally, and she is given little to do but beam pleasantly at him or look perpetually concerned for his health and well being.`Man on the Moon's one element of undeniable brilliance lies in the triumphant performance of Jim Carrey in the starring role.  In physical appearance, in mannerisms, in comic stylings, he, quite literally, becomes Andy Kaufman!  Whether on stage or behind-the-scenes, Carrey never hits a false note, displaying his uncanny ability to bring out the humanity that might easily have been lost in a portrayal of a very eccentric comic artist. Indeed, Carrey lends some much needed depth to a screenplay that, in its bare-bone plotting, often seems undernourished and underfed.  `Man on the Moon' becomes, ultimately then, more compelling as a steppingstone in Carrey's development as an artist than as an elegy for the artist who once was."

Buddy Games,2019,4.8,"A group of friends reunite to play The Buddy Games, a wild assortment of absurd physical and mental challenges. In the process, they'll heal old wounds, right past wrongs and figure out the true meaning of friendship...or die trying.","If you were hoping for a fun/funny movie akin to The Hangover or Tag (which it's obviously ripping off heavily), look somewhere else. I kept hoping for some redeeming quality somewhere in this movie. It doesn't exist. There is nothing remotely believable in this flick. The humor is forced and doesn't flow naturally and most of the friends seem to hate each other."
The New Mutants,2020,5.3,"Five young mutants, just discovering their abilities while held in a secret facility against their will, fight to escape their past sins and save themselves.","Reviewers say 'The New Mutants' delves into psychological horror, teenage angst, and mutant power struggles. Criticisms include inconsistent pacing, underdeveloped characters, and genre commitment issues. Some applaud its unique X-Men universe approach, strong performances, and intriguing plot elements. Others find it disappointing due to clich√©s, lack of tension, and perceived flaws in direction and writing. Visual effects and mutant powers receive mixed reviews‚Äîsome praise creativity, others find them underwhelming. Overall, 'The New Mutants' is a divisive X-Men entry with potential for improvement."

Tulip Fever,2017,6.2,An artist falls for a young married woman while he's commissioned to paint her portrait during the Tulip mania of seventeenth century Amsterdam.,"A love story (actually two of them) play out amid the backdrop of the famous tulip mania of Amsterdam, ca 1634. Both love stories hinge on wild improbabilites that are almost laughable. The story is based on a novel so we can perhaps blame it on that. Regardless, the movie is vastly entertaining (but not in the so-bad-it's-good category. There is a lot to like.) As we are told Tulip trading was rampant and ""fortunes were won and lost"" all because of a ""beautiful flower.""Sophia (Alicia Vikander) is an orphan under the care of a convent that specializes in providing care and education for such unfortunates. She is appropriated by a wealthy nobleman (Cornelius Sandvoort) in Amsterdan who wants to marry and sire an heir. Historical context---keep in mind that Henry was fairly recent history at this time---can make this a daunting task for a young lady but Cornelius turns out to be a saint, an anomaly for one so powerful in such times. He has a love for his young wife and by and by he hires a handsome young painter (Dane DeHann, who bears a rather strong resemblance to a young Leonardo DeCaprio) to paint a portrait of he and his wife. Uh oh.Meanwhile Sophia's servant, Maria (Holliday Grainger) is carrying on with a fishmonger (James Dryden), who wants to marry her and due to his low station tries to strike it rich with tulips. Complications ensue whereby Sophia and Maria concoct a scheme which might be termed the Mission Impossible of 1634 that strains credulity but can be overlooked with effort. Alica Vikander, the main heroine, agrees to some clandestine sittings for her young painter and in the doing is mind-stopping beautiful. (Vermeer would have loved her. She would not need golden earrings). What happens besides sitting and painting in these sessions is easily surmised.Judi Dench is the Mother Superior (or whatever her title might be) but not per the usual, she is capable of the nod and the wink and can speak quite plainly not to mention her business acumen. You see, the convent grows, buys, and sells tulips and they need a shrewd-y to handle all that ... Judi does just this with aplomb all the while maintaining at least an appearance of piety. (Although if I remember correctly she actually hits somebody over the head with something.)Another character is old Amersterdam, or the depiction of it. Swarming denizens bustle about in droves along streets and waterfront fulfilling the need for historcal context (along with the tulips, of course)."
Insidious: Chapter 2,2013,6.6,"The Lamberts believe that they have defeated the spirits that have haunted their family, but they soon discover that evil is not beaten so easily.","Insidious: Chapter 2 starts up almost right after the original Insidious ended with Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai (Rose Byrne) Lambert reunited with their son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) after his spirit was held prisoner by a demon in an afterlife dimension called 'The Further'. But, as we saw in the final frames, something else was now inhabiting Josh's body and it had strangled paranormal investigator Elise (Lin Shaye) to death. We pick up as the unsuspecting family, including older son Foster (Andrew Astor) and their infant daughter Kali, have moved in with Josh's mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) while police investigate Elise's mysterious death in their house. They are barely moved in when supernatural occurrences start to begin again with objects moving, spectral voices, apparitions appearing and dear old dad acting very strange. While Renai tries to deal with the fact that supernatural forces are still with them, Josh tries to convince her all is well and Lorraine decides to team up with Elise's former assistants paranormal investigators Specs (Leigh Whannell who also wrote the screenplay) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) along with one of the original investigators from Josh's childhood haunting, Carl (Steve Coulter) to get down to the bottom of these haunted hi-jinx once and for all. And that is all I will say about the story as, despite some familiar trappings, James Wan (The Conjuring) takes this installment in some clever directions and once again uses the familiar elements very well. We get to know the story behind the evil woman in black seen in the last film and even revisit The Further though, this time it is inventively linked to events in the first film. The pace is a bit slower and more methodical this time round but, since this film is a bit of a mystery as well as haunting, it takes it's time to let the story unfold and secrets be revealed. We still get some spooky scenes but, it is refreshingly mixed in with Lorraine and co's equally goose bump inducing investigation. And what they find is deviously fun. The film is not quite as lively as Insidious part one but, I liked the mystery element and the film earned points with me for using it's return to 'The Further' a bit more clever and less silly then last time. That is the point where the first film lost it's grip on me and here I like how it was done and was with this supernatural chiller up to the spooky end. Wan is a good director and he takes what could have been a ho-hum retread and makes it a fun follow-up. He gets good performances out of all his cast and while I found Patrick Wilson to be bland in both Insidious and The Conjuring, he gets a far more lively performance out of him here. He gets to ham it up a bit and it suits him. The film has some beautiful and creepy visuals, as is Wan's trademark, and Joseph Bishara's score adds some nice atmosphere too. So in conclusion, while the story elements are more familiar; we've seen some of it before and the pace a bit slower, Wan does give us a spooky mystery to add to the paranormal activity and makes much more clever use of his otherworldly 'Further'. He also gives us some clever answers to the questions left by his first Insidious and that all adds up to a spooky fun time at the movies. Also stars House Of The Devil's Joceline Donahue as young Lorraine in some equally clever flashback sequences that tie into the rest of the film in a fun way."
Insidious: Chapter 3,2015,6.1,A prequel set before the haunting of the Lambert family that reveals how gifted psychic Elise Rainier reluctantly agrees to use her ability to contact the dead in order to help a teenage girl who has been targeted by a dangerous supernatural entity.,"In lots of ways Insidious is one of the most unlikely franchise's existing today and unlike many of its other horror franchise counterparts it really is the film series that could, for over three films now Insidious has managed to be both profitable and also most importantly highly watchable and more than a little bit creepy.The first two Insidious tales saw Saw co-creators and Australia's unsung Hollywood hero's James Wan and Leigh Whannell deliver some otherworldly chills without resorting to OTT violence or gore splatter that has sadly been a staple of modern day horror films that think the more blood spilled the more effective the film will be and with this third entry to the franchise Leigh Whannell takes over directing duties from his now box office superstar buddy Wan which sees him do a more than admirable job.A long time player in the modern horror scene, Whannell surely knows a thing or two about what freaks us movie goers out and where the first Insidious scared us with its white faced man and then the second got us with its red faced demon, here in the third chapter which is in fact a prequel of sorts to the events of what has transpired before, Whannell creates a figure almost as scary as Jigsaw himself with the ""Man that can't breathe"". A horrible and off putting creation this figure is a large part of the reason why this entry into the series keeps the chills coming and while Whannell relies on the jump scare and silent soundtrack situation quite a lot to make Insidious scary, there's little denying there's more ingenuity here than most other low budgeted horror flicks.There's also a surprising amount of heart thrown into the mix here and while it may come off as cheesy and sap-filled, it's nice for a film of this ilk to throw some emotional resonance into an otherwise highly unrealistic scenario of possessed teens and ghost worlds.While the dialogue can sometimes fall flat and Whannell and Angus Sampson's comical ghost hunters that played large parts in the first films still feel a little out of place, Insidious 3 is a highly watchable and often highly effective piece of horror filmmaking that never tries to outstretch its reach.After three solid films it feels as though the makers of Insidious know exactly what their films are and what they aren't and we as an audience can be thankful for that and now can look forward to what Whannell and his team have in store for us when chapter 4 hopefully eventuates.3 footprints out of 5"
Crimson Peak,2015,6.5,A new bride investigates ghostly visions at a remote gothic mansion that holds dark secrets.,"Guillermo del Toro is a director and artist whose films fall into two distinct categories: big budget English language blockbusters like ""Hellboy"" and ""Pacific Rim"" and lesser known, low budget Spanish language horror films like ""Devil's Backbone"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth"". His latest film, ""Crimson Peak"" is what happens when these two worlds collide, in other words, a big budget English language horror film.""Crimson Peak"" is set in the late 19th century, first in New York, then in rural England. Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) is a young budding writer who is intelligent, beautiful, and strong willed, refusing to allow Victorian sensibilities dictate what she can and cannot do, and as a result butts heads with those around her. Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) is an English aristocrat and inventor who is in New York seeking financial backing for his mechanized clay mining business back home. When tragedy strikes, Thomas marries Edith and brings her to his home, Allerdale Hall in Cumberland, where his sister Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain) is waiting. As Edith tries to fit into her new surroundings, she discovers that secrets abound and nothing is as it seems.The visuals in ""Crimson Peak"" are so glorious, they are almost overwhelming. The sets are spectacular visions of beauty and decadence in decay; costumes are intricately detailed and gorgeous; the lighting and over saturated color bring depth and meaning; the ghosts are grotesquely beautiful; and, of course, the del Toro trademarks of insects and clockwork gracefully found their way into the story as well.Because ""Crimson Peak"" is a rather large studio production, it is being marketed to a large audience. I believe this accounts for some of the lackluster reviews I have been reading. If one is not familiar with del Toro's prior Spanish language films, they may not understand his unique cinematic perspective. For some, this will mark the beginning of a journey into del Toro's fantasy world, for others it will be a disappointment. For me, it was almost everything I wanted it to be."
Industry,,7.5,Young bankers and traders make their way in the financial world in the aftermath of the 2008 collapse.,"I'm currently watching Industry with my brother as I write this review and the first thing that comes to mind when watching this show is...addicting. HBO is known for having great shows and Industry is no different. It really is a good show that feels fresh and thrilling. It shows the cutthroat world that is banking. It's a fascinating look inside their world of greed, sex, drugs, back stabbing and every other bad thing these people do to each other. You don't have to know much about this world to enjoy the show, I think most people watching don't and that's a testament to how good the writing is. You really do get pulled into that world and can't wait to see what happens next. I'm fully invested in this show and I think you will be to if you give it a chance."
Eden,2020,6.1,"A coming-of-age film about a religious summer camp, Eden tells the story through the eyes of three youths who are torn between ideology, independence and falling in love.","Ulla Heikkil√§ sends her cast to summer camp and skillfully juggles a handful of the most recognizable teen moods. In her homoerotic storyline she sets up an approaching make-out scene with an admirable patience. The movie gets an extra gear of conviction through the camp leader, played by Tommi Korpela, who is so strong in his delivery that I suspect he was determined to boost his co-stars to shine a bit extra. And they do exactly that. Main character Aamu Milonoff's delightfully uncomplicated aura sends warm vibrations through the screen every time she's on. The writer director also makes one of the big mistakes. She designs a heroine with a lover and ignores that the audience must approve or they'll hate being on her journey. An easily made mistake when cynically squeezing in political viewpoints into entertainment."
Edge of Tomorrow,2014,7.9,A man fighting in a war against aliens must relive the same day every time he dies until he can find a way to stop their power source with the help of an elite soldier.,"Wow - this was unexpected. The trailers had me believe that after 'Battle L.A.' and 'Oblivion' this would be yet another bleak, action- packed, special effects driven Sci-Fi blockbuster about an alien invasion - what the trailers failed to convey almost entirely is that over long stretches, this is also seasoned with nearly as much humor as 'Groundhog Day'. That it would invite comparisons with the Harold Ramis/ Bill Murray classic was obvious, given the time loop premise, but I never expected to what extent those comparisons would actually be justified and that this film would really tap into a similar kind of comedy. Luckily, it is all the better for it.Most unexpected of all, the main reason the comical aspects during the first half of the film work so well, is Tom Cruise's character, Major William Cage. This is easily Cruise's meatiest role since his turn in 'Magnolia' as Frank T.J. Mackey; forget his usual stern, poster boy heroes: here he plays an entirely different character ‚Äì and he really seems to relish the opportunity. I won't give away too much, but be prepared to chuckle and laugh when you see a new side of Tom Cruise.Yet while this is not nearly as bleak as the trailers suggested, it certainly isn't a comedy either. And it absolutely IS an action-packed, special effects driven Sci-Fi blockbuster about battling an alien invasion (the trailers got that right), albeit one with a funny bone and great characters. Speaking of which, the rest of the cast is also very good, especially the gorgeous Emily Blunt. It seems that no matter what she does, she always comes across as genuine and real; here she succeeds in portraying her character - a tough, seasoned soldier other soldiers refer to as ""full metal bitch"" (no kidding!) - with just the right touch of vulnerability to make her that much more believable. Bill Paxton and Brendon Gleeson are always a welcome addition to any movie, and while they are great (as usual), character-wise, they don't do anything here that you haven't seen them do before.As for the Sci-Fi spectacle that the trailers promised, I'm glad to report that the film delivers. The battle scenes are beautifully orchestrated (not the Transformer-style blur where you can't make out anything anymore), and there are moments when the intensity of the fighting recalls the landing on Omaha Beach in 'Saving Private Ryan' - without the gore, obviously (after all, this is PG-13). The design of the aliens - the production design in general - is incredibly well done, although I would lie if I said it was something ground-breaking and new the way the first 'Matrix' was (it IS breathtaking, though).So my verdict: With one of the most inventive (adapted) scripts for an original (mega-budget) film in a long time and the best Tom Cruise we've seen in years, 'Edge of Tomorrow' will have you chuckle and laugh nearly as much as drop your jaw in awe: this is what Hollywood should take as a blueprint for exciting summer entertainment henceforth. 9 stars out of 10.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
Land of the Dead,2005,6.2,"The living dead have taken over the world, and the last humans live in a walled city to protect themselves as they come to grips with the situation.","Reviewers say 'Land of the Dead' continues George Romero's tradition of social commentary, dark humor, and gore. The film delves into class division, corporate greed, and societal collapse. It features a bleak, post-apocalyptic setting and focuses on human survival and morality. The zombies, while retaining their classic slow, shambling nature, exhibit increased intelligence and coordination. The film blends horror with social critique, though some reviewers feel the commentary is more overt and less subtle than in earlier films."
The Dead Don't Die,2019,5.4,The focus is on the sleepy small town of Centerville where the dead become undead.,"I hate this movie. I saw it for free and still want my money back. It is an absolutely pointless, meandering vanity project that attempts to trick you into thinking it's cleverer than it is. According to the director himself, it was designed to be a dumb movie comprised of dumb bits as a way to make money hanging out with his friends. And what's worse is that the trailer tricks you into thinking it is an entirely different movie - the worst kind of lie you can tell in an effort to lure people away from their hard-earned money and precious time.There is literally no point to anything that happens; Jarmusch has no sense of pace or urgency or meaning. And in my opinion, art for the sake of itself alone is condescending towards your audience. I normally like his work, along with all of the actors, the subject matter and tone - this should have been right in my wheelhouse. But I left feeling like the director had a contemptuous view of the people watching his film (in EVERY regard) and that just doesn't sit well with me. Not everything has to matter in a movie, but SOMETHING should.Ultimately, it felt like a third-rate SNL skit that was allowed to drag on for two hours."
Huisdiergeheimen 2,2019,6.4,"Continuing the story of Max and his pet friends, following their secret lives after their owners leave them for work or school each day.","Fun movie but loses track of story as others have mentioned and the eastern european bad guy stereotype is boringly outdated by now, maybe it works for US audiences still? Cute and fun characters. Louis CK's replacement did a good job."
Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things,2015,6.6,How might your life be better with less?,"Minimalism can be an eye-opening message for anyone who hasn't been exposed to it, but for most, it's too little too late. Documentaries like Food Inc and An Inconvenient Truth were ahead of their time, coming out before the zenith of the information age. But minimalism has pervaded through blogs, books, Youtube, college lectures and TED already, and making this documentary at this time was a very safe choice.It has a little bit of everything, some dialogue from semi-famous bloggers (and Sam Harris), a few anecdotes, pictures, data, some shots of Americans being iphone-addicted slobs. It has a lot of good one liners but doesn't particularly go into any one thing in depth. I don't think I walked away from it knowing anything I didn't already know.Every now and then, I do need a little reminder to cut back on my excess and focus on quality rather than quantity, and this movie does that. It's useful for that.But this joins a long line of works with the clich√© message of ""avoid consumerism, find fulfilment in your life and live in the woods maybe""."
The New Pope,,8.0,Two Popes. Only one Vatican. A holy war to come.,"This new series is CLEARLY intended for a ""certain"" kind of audience - people complaining about Malkovich and how ""slow"" and ""boring"" the first episodes are, simply can't understand what they're missing.
Outstanding visuals, outstanding dialogues, oustanding acting - a deep, provocative (but not offensive) well-thought portrait of the marvelous complexity of the Christian (and not only Christian) Church in the 21st Century.
Please, try to watch it until the very last second of the last episode (a true masterpiece of an episode!): because it gets better and better, and all makes sense as a whole. If you left the series after ep. 1 or even 2/3, your vote simply doesn't mean anything."
Guns Akimbo,2019,6.3,A guy relies on his newly-acquired gladiator skills to save his ex-girlfriend from kidnappers.,"This is the kind of film you have to just put your mind on autopilot for and enjoy. The action and shootout scenes are very well done, with some sharp direction and editing. The story is a little too absurd and not based in reality whatsoever, but that's the point. It reminds me a bit of the movie Shoot 'Em Up, which was another tongue-in-cheek gun extravaganza, but fortunately Guns Akimbo is a lot funnier and more stylish, making it a pretty cool watch if you're not looking for anything mind-expanding."
Gretel,2020,5.5,"In a distant land, two siblings, Hansel and Gretel, wander through the woods in search of food and work. When a mysterious lady offers them a way out, they accept without thinking about the consequences.","Osgood Perkins' 'Gretel & Hansel' is a visually arresting and atmospherically rich horror tale with a script that doesn't quite reach the heights of the storyline told through imagery. The movie loses itself too often in a dreamscape horror without rectifying or clarifying, which leaves the metaphor foggy and the horror muted. The performances are decent: Sophia Lillis holds the screen with a quiet confidence as Gretel and the sensational Alice Krige making for a supremely chilling The Witch."
All the Money in the World,2017,6.8,The story of the kidnapping of 16-year-old John Paul Getty III and the desperate attempt by his devoted mother to convince his billionaire grandfather Jean Paul Getty to pay the ransom.,"""A Getty is special. A Getty is nobody's friend."" J. Paul Getty (Christopher Plummer)If Ridley Scott's All the Money in the World does anything well, it shows the banality of crime and wealth, at least as this abduction/ransom motif plays out. It's the story inspired by the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III (Charlie Plummer) in 1973, his grandfather's resistance to paying the Italian Red Brigade's ransom demand, and the heroic effort of his mother, Gail Harris (Michelle Williams), to bring her son back alive.After slogging through the tepid back story (disjointed to say the least), the story gains strength through the passions of its leading players, both of whom have strong feelings about the right way to respond to the kidnappers' demand for $17 million ransom. Mom would pay, considering grandpa is the richest man who ever lived, and he does not in principle want to capitulate.Yet he may also have reasons to deny the ransom, one that paying would open floodgates of abductions for his other grandchildren and a point made later on but nonetheless fascinating history about the nature of the Getty fortune. Regardless, the central conflict of the story is not the kidnapping but the struggle between patriarch and daughter-in-law for the soul of the family and the deliverance of III.Although the cross editing between home and kidnappers is sometimes jarring, the director makes the audience feel as if it's present at the contentious proceedings. Trying to understand why the old man resists the ransom is a most difficult situation for parents who couldn't possibly do anything other than pay, but the audience can witness the arguments as if right there among the players.Coldness pervades this film, as if Scott were able to let the audience feel the lack of warmth from the old man's. Several scenes show him in front of large fireplaces, evoking a Citizen Kane ambience. Getty echoes the self-centered, aloof, lonely Charles Foster Kane.For the history and the acting, All the Money in the World is worth enjoying this season. Williams plays a resolute and resourceful mother and Plummer infuses the Scrooge-like Getty with a humanity that feels like we are with the real tycoon.The film is also a cautionary tale about the corruption of wealth and the tenuous familial relations when money is the major player. See it and be happy with your small fortune, which may be, I hope, your loved ones."
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,2019,6.5,Lawman Luke Hobbs and outcast Deckard Shaw form an unlikely alliance when a cyber-genetically enhanced villain threatens the future of humanity.,"Man, don't trust the negative reviews. This film is full of action and it was a treat to watch in cinema. Some great laughs, cameos and epic stunts!"
Le rire,2020,6.3,"Mixing realism and worrying strangeness, Le Rire presents a humane exploration of the survivor's syndrome, the grieving process, the distance of time, the power of love, and the joy of being alive.","Sensualit√©Written byAlbert Hammond,Shelly PeikenandAxelle RedPerformed byAxelle RedCourtesy of Music and Roses"
The Discovery,2017,6.2,"Two years after the afterlife is scientifically proven, a man attempts to help a young woman break away from her dark past.","Just reading the synopsis raised my expectations, which is perhaps why the movie fell flat for me. Instead of an exploration of an intriguing idea, the film really became a declaration of faith in what is essentially a notion that cannot be proven and thus cannot really be known. When assertions are made about the mysteries of consciousness, you either believe them or you do not.I would have given this a higher rating just for tackling such a difficult topic but the direction, acting and even cinematography never really came together. There were plenty of big, proven names who lent their prestige to this project and yet surprisingly none of the people involved seemed willing to commit. It was like they all knew the outcome would stink but no one wanted to sully their reputations by doing a bad job.It is worth a watch if you are fans of some of the actors as I am. The arc of the plot is not unsatisfying even though it is in many instances frustrating. A film perhaps to while away the time and put yourself in a more contemplative mood."
Bombshell,2019,6.8,A group of women take on Fox News head Roger Ailes and the toxic atmosphere he presided over at the network.,"I didn't know much on this story when it all happened, possibly cause I'm based in Australia and it was an American scandal, but the whole story is so powerful and should be shared across the globe.When Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) is let go from her job at Fox News, she sues the CEO, Roger Ailes (John Lithgow), for sexual harassment. Going up against a powerful man in a even more powerful company, Gretchen seeks help from other female employees to come forward and speak up and make an end to this man.I really enjoyed this film, but felt I could've enjoyed it even more if I knew more about the story when it was happening. In saying that, it didn't make the film confusing or bad in any form.
It's a powerful story that needs to be shared for how woman can be treated in the workplace and hopefully spreads the message that inappropriate sexual behaviour is never acceptable and should be spoken up about.Nicole, Charlize and Margot were all so damn good in this film. Three incredible ladies. I would've liked to have seen a bit more on Margot's character, but I then learnt after that her character isn't part of the real life scandal.This is a great movie to start off the new year."
Percy,2020,6.4,A Canadian farmer takes on a giant corporation after their GMOs interfere with his crops.,"It's based on a true story. Very good & believable acting overall from the entire cast, I thoroughly enjoyed this particular topic as i wasn't aware of this iconic trial which became an International precedent for other Farmers worldwide, and not be part of Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) trying to own farmlands via their majority shares on MONSANTO Genetically Modified Organisms => Let me refresh you the horrible haunting Eugenics/Transhumanist damages of the past: Remember the Terminator Seeds Scandal?Where Multiple Companies & their shareholders tried to create a MONOPOLY of the World's Agriculture, country per country, while minimizing the damages on Human Health & escaping from this form of Bio-Terrorism; which eventually blew up with hundreds of lawsuits worldwide in 2014? Well there ya go.I thoroughly enjoyed the evolution of the main thematic, from an isolated & local idyllic farming town issue, to an International problematic, from which the Suffering & Death are implicit themes, that are shared in specific scenes between the main cast & other characters (especially was fascinated by the dialogue on Far East Philosophies & Religious beliefs).This movie is a Testament between those who Love & cherish the intrinsic value of LIFE and those who worship a Culture of DEATH.Ps: I hope somebody makes a movie about Jos√© Bov√©, the french farmer who used a Flamethrower on Monsanto GMO Fields & even burnt a McDonalds that promoted GMO Food... was sent to jail. He is now a E. U. Green Party Parliamentary."
Koirat eiv√§t k√§yt√§ housuja,2019,6.7,"Juha has lost his wife in a drowning accident. Years after he still feels numb and unable to connect with people. Meeting Mona, a dominatrix, changes everything.","...came back having all my expectations subverted. No, this movie is NOT just about sex or bdsm, it does have a decent story behind it. It's about Juha, dealing with the loss of his wife and getting into the kink world in the process. The story does lack depth and I was a bit disapointed that Mona's story wasn't explored more. I was surprised how visual the movie was and how little dialogue this had, it was a nice touch. And can I say how great the actors were in this? The performances of the two leads were absolutely stellar! Go in with an open mind."
The Way Back,2020,6.7,"Jack Cunningham was a high school basketball phenom who walked away from the game, forfeiting his future. Years later, when he reluctantly accepts a coaching job at his alma mater, he may get one last shot at redemption.","Looks like a sports movie and it is, but only for 50%, because there is much more to this story:.Ben Affleck is an alcohol addicted basketball coach, who volunteers to coach a team of lousy amateurs at his old highschool. That's the sports part of the movie.But there is a lot of (bleak) slowburning drama as well. Look at the poster. Ben Affleck looks depressed and he is. In this story Ben Affleck has lost his wife, his son has died and he has lost every dream or hope he has ever had. He only drinks himself into oblivion to numb his pain. Will he in some way be able to start coping with the death of his young son, which caused him to start drinking in the first place? That's the heart of this touching movie.The good: Terrific acting performance of an alcohol addict by Ben Affleck. Subtle direction of this drama by director Gavin O Conner. Really touching and UPLIFTING story.Any bad? Well, it's certainly not a straight forward success sports movie. It's quite bleak and depressing at moments, because the real focus of this movie is about Ben Affleck's alcohol addiction and some might not like to watch such a slowburning movie about such a bleak subject... I did though. I was really impressed..."
Tony Robbins: I Am Not Your Guru,2016,6.6,"TONY ROBBINS: I AM NOT YOUR GURU, a feature documentary film about internationally renowned life and business strategist Tony Robbins, is a revelatory cin√©ma v√©rit√© film that goes behind the scenes of his mammoth seminar ""Date With Destiny,"" attended by over 2,500 people in Boca Raton, Florida, each year, to give an insider look at how one man can affect millions.

The constant cussing can be a genuine turn-off.Not exactly a 'documentary' but more an advertisement of Tony Robbins' philosophies.Comes across as a bit of a cult but an intelligent viewer can take away something meaningful from it.
Paper Towns,2015,6.2,"After an all-night adventure, Quentin's lifelong crush, Margo, disappears, leaving behind clues that Quentin and his friends follow on the journey of a lifetime.","Quentin Jacobsen is an Orlando high school senior with a small comfort zone. He's a band geek with his best friends Ben and Radar. Margo has been living across the street for 11 years. They were friends when she first arrived. They found a dead body but he refused to follow her adventures and they drifted apart. Now suddenly, she climbs into his window. She pulls him into a night of revenge against her cheating boyfriend and her backstabbing friends. She's gone the next day but she has left clues for Quentin to find her paper town. Quentin, Ben, Radar, Radar's girlfriend Angela, and Margo's friend Lacey go on a road trip.Cara Delevingne shows competent acting and a good intriguing presence which is necessary for the role. The movie starts with her taking our lead on a nice adventure. It has its moments. I like those one-night adventures in movies. Then there is the mystery which is less compelling because I'm mostly waiting for the inevitable road trip. I also like a good road trip and this one has its moments, too. The movie ends with a nice 'lesson'. Everything is fair but nothing is outstanding. The three guys are nice but lacks great charisma. They are more and less regular teens which has its appeal. I like their friendship. As a book, I'm sure this has many fans. As a movie, it needs more adventures and more cinematic excitement. It could have tightened the middle and added more to the road trip when the group is together. This is fine but it could have been much better."
"Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator",2019,6.7,Tracing from his rise in the 1970s to his disgrace in accusations of rape and sexual harassment in more recent years.,"""Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator"" is an exceptionally well made and well constructed documentary. It's also one that, by the end, will probably also make you very angry for a variety of reasons.The story is about Bikram Choudhury, a world famous yogi who built a huge financial business empire in the United States in the 1980s until nearly today. The first portion of the film essentially talks about Bikram's history and his style...and his followers talk about him glowingly. The second portion of the film then changes focus--to the sexual harassment and sexual abuse by Bikram. Additionally, his reaction to these allegations and lawsuits follows...and how he essentially got away with it will leave you angry and confused.Overall, exceptionally well made and a film this is nearly perfect. My only complaints were a few of the interviews seemed ill-suited for the film, as they had no first hand knowledge of Bikram's horrible behaviors. Still, the documentary is compelling and well worth seeing."
Tenet,2020,7.3,"Armed with only the word ""Tenet,"" and fighting for the survival of the entire world, CIA operative, The Protagonist, journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a global mission that unfolds beyond real time.","Reviewers say 'Tenet' is visually stunning with impressive action and unique concepts, though the convoluted plot and underdeveloped characters receive criticism. Kenneth Branagh's performance is praised, while responses to John David Washington and Robert Pattinson vary. Sound mixing and dialogue clarity are common complaints. Despite issues, the film's ambition and technical achievements are appreciated, with some suggesting multiple viewings for better understanding."
Schumacher,2021,7.4,"Through exclusive interviews and archival footage, this documentary traces an intimate portrait of seven-time Formula 1 champion Michael Schumacher.","A wonderfully inspiring sports documentary that focuses on the racing legend's iconic rise, Schumacher is a shining example of the good stuff that Netflix is capable of producing. The documentary really humanizes the larger-than-life Schumacher - as a friend, a colleague, a family member, and an excellent racecar driver - all perspectives well-rooted and covered in equal measure. Even his competent peers only had the greatest things to say about him. The makers thankfully do not relegate it to a sheer puff-piece by also showcasing Schumacher's vulnerabilities and struggles before he became 7-time World Champion. It also doesn't resort to excessive melodrama and focuses less on the accident that rendered him catatonic. Private matters stay strictly private. It's a competently made tribute piece that mires millennials in beautiful nostalgia.Is 1h 52m enough to cover Schumacher's life? Not at all. Is it still worth a watch? Definitely."
The Intruder,2019,5.6,"A young married couple buy a beautiful house on several acres of land, only to find out that the man they bought it from refuses to let go of the property.","Extremely predictable I have no idea why the good reviews or I mean glowing reviews?!!? I mean it's watchable but if you've ever watched movies before u know every single thing that's going to happen. I felt this from the first 5 minutes of this movie, but saw Dennis Quaid & thought ok maybe itll surprise me...nope. Idk I guess I'm not mad I rented it for 1.75 lol."
The Lobster,2015,7.1,"In a dystopian near future, according to the laws of The City, single people are taken to The Hotel, where they are obliged to find a romantic partner in 45 days or they're transformed into beasts and sent off into The Woods.","There's no chance that you'll see a film as weird as The Lobster this whole year. In what is effectively an indie art-house piece, you get a completely insane and almost unfathomable world filled with more and more absurdities everywhere you look. However, it's such an incredibly unique and eye-catching film that it's still hugely engrossing and surprisingly entertaining to watch.The story centres around one man, played by Colin Farrell, as he attempts to find a partner as a part of this bizarre system. The first act revolves around his time in 'The Hotel', and is not only hugely odd, but both dramatic and unnerving as well as hilarious to watch, featuring some of the best dark comedy written in years.The film takes its story as seriously as any drama, and you feel that through the deeply disturbing atmosphere that emerges off the screen. However, as the film is just so weird, it eases you into the oddness of it all very impressively through the use of humour, something that more pretentious art-house films fail to do, and are resultantly a lot harder to really get into.So, you'll definitely be laughing a lot, if not in a more disturbed than hugely entertained manner, throughout the first act, and by the end of it, you'll surely be as used as you can be to the incredibly weird feel of this whole film.Just to give you an idea of how unorthodox this film is, every scene is full of awkward silences, the actors speak as if they're reading off of cue cards with no emotion whatsoever, the imagery is very ugly and unpleasant to look at right the way through, and the incredible slow pace of it all means that the film feels like it goes on for about five times as long as it actually does.And yet, I still can't get around the fact that this is a brilliant film. Mainly, it's the fact that it's just so unique and almost shockingly bizarre, but it's just filled with so many captivating ideas that it's impossible not to be fully drawn into this insane story.So, the performances, the directing, the writing, and pretty much everything is stunning, apart from one big issue that prevents this from being a truly incredible film. Following the end of the first act, the film does lose its way quite a lot, taking almost too big a leap into an even stranger abyss than you ever imagined at the beginning, and, with a little less humour in the latter stages, isn't as easy to watch as the first act had been.However, it does pick up again towards a terrifying and as bizarre as ever conclusion, and that's why I'm going to give The Lobster a 9 out of 10, but I must warn you that if you feel you can't cope with this film for longer than the first twenty minutes, then it's not for you. This is definitely a cult film for the ages, but won't be a big hit with general audiences."
Toxikoma,2021,7.0,"The film deals with the chapter of Gyozo Szabo's book of the same title, which is about the actor's toughest period, the drug crash that lasts for years, as Gyozo falls on the atoms of his life, and then enters the withdrawal cure, where he is treated by Dr. Csernus. Because of his style, the film shows the struggle and tension of each other, a psychiatrist who almost...Read all","I am the first one to write a review, so I'll be very honest. When I got to the cinema I was very excited about this movie, some people said that it's the hungarian version of 'requiem for a dream'. In the first 30 minutes I liked everything, the protagonist character 'Gyozo' was a good choice for the role, (he reminded me of John Travolta from Pulp Fiction, maybe it was an easter egg Lmao), the CGI effecrs were well made, and gave the terrifying images of a drug trip, and were awesome. But then problems came. Dr. Cernus's character does not feel right. He somehow is overacting his role, doesnt feel genuine. The scritp is good, but besides the acting of Gyozo's character, I was bored by the other characters and events.Overall 6 stars means that it's worth to watch, but dont expect a film as poweful as Requiem for a dream."
Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar,2021,6.3,Lifelong friends Barb and Star embark on the adventure of a lifetime when they decide to leave their small Midwestern town for the first time - ever.,"... and I absolutely LOVED it! I couldn't stop laughing! It was just what is needed with everything going on. Its fun, colorful, cheery and completely rediculous (in a good way). One of those movies you can watch again and again, good background while going things around the house. The music numbers are really well done and funny, the acting was great. It's like a toss up of those cheesy movies like Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion crossed with the even more rediculous ones like Airplane with a touch of Austin Powers type bad guys and a little bit of musical thrown in. Definitely worth a watch if you enjoy stuff like that."
Squid Game,,8.0,"Hundreds of cash-strapped players accept a strange invitation to compete in children's games. A tempting prize awaits, but with deadly high stakes.","Reviewers say 'Squid Game' is acclaimed for its unique premise, engaging plot, and strong Korean cast performances. The show is lauded for its commentary on social inequality and human nature. However, criticisms include predictable plot twists, inconsistent logic, and the acting of the VIP characters. Some find the ending unsatisfactory and the second season lacking compared to the first. Despite these criticisms, many still find the series captivating and worth watching."
Dawn of the Dead,2004,7.2,"A nurse, a policeman, a young married couple and other survivors of a worldwide plague that is producing aggressive, flesh-eating zombies take refuge in a mega Midwestern shopping mall.","Reviewers say 'Dawn of the Dead' (2004) is a divisive remake, praised for its action-packed sequences, improved special effects, and faster pace. The fast-moving zombies, inspired by '28 Days Later,' receive mixed reactions. Many appreciate the updated approach and standalone quality, while others miss the original's social commentary and character depth. Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames' performances are highlighted, but the ending and certain character decisions are criticized. Overall, it's seen as an entertaining yet imperfect reimagining."
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping,2016,6.7,"When it becomes clear that his solo album is a failure, a former boy band member does everything in his power to maintain his celebrity status.","If you understand Lonely Island you will love this movie. It may not be for everyone, however I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. If you don't know what Lonely Island is google them and watch them on youtube. This movie perfectly set the stage for a world were the lonely island crew had massive fans, but in reality their fanbase is rather small.Still the movie has massive laughs, the references are on point, and some of the songs are actually pretty good parodies of other genres.I give the movie a solid 9 out of 10. If I wasn't a Lonely Island fan I would still give it at least a solid 7. It's entertaining and fun, and a nice divergence from the Super Hero dominated world we have today."
Napoleon Dynamite,2004,7.0,"A listless and alienated teenager helps his new friend win the class presidency in their small western high school, while dealing with his bizarre family life back home.","Napoleon Dynamite by all means is not a five-star masterpiece, and it mayn't be to everybody's tastes but I was surprised at how much I liked it, even with its problems. I can also say I do think there are much worse movies out there- Disaster Movie, Epic Movie, Home Alone 4, Cat in the Hat and Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2 are much worse than this film.What I did like about Napoleon Dynamite was that it was unique, funny, quirky and original. Where it is not quite so good is in the episodic story structure and some of the supporting characters particularly comic-book-geek older brother and the ageing jock uncle were disappointingly one-dimensional and could have been further explored in terms of depth.Napoleon Dynamite does have a refreshingly distinctive time-warp look that recalls the style-challenged 1980s though, and that was refreshing in itself. The soundtrack is nice and nostalgic, and there are some genuinely laugh-out-loud funny moments. Also the ending is suitably uplifting and the limited horizons of young people in small-town America is nicely conveyed. The script is good and the direction is pretty solid.As are the performances. Jon Heder is delightfully eccentric in the title role, and he is really entertaining throughout, whether it is in the voice, the facial expressions or his character's actions. Napoleon is a blank-faced teen with carrot-coloured hair and seriously underdeveloped interpersonal skills, and here he tries to help his nerd of a best friend Pedro, amusingly played by Efren Ramirez. In terms of other supporting performances, Aaron Ruell also does a good job as Kip and while his role wasn't as well-sketched as it could have been, Jonathan Gries does nicely as Uncle Rico.Overall, not perfect, but amusing, quirky and unique. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
Night Teeth,2021,5.7,"A college student moonlighting as a chauffeur picks up two mysterious women for a night of party-hopping across LA. But when he uncovers their bloodthirsty intentions - and their dangerous, shadowy underworld - he must fight to stay alive.",It started out ok but about halfway in it got a little boring. Some of long drawn out meaningless dialouge between Benny and Blaire almost put me to sleep. I wouldn't say it's the worst vampire movie out there and its definitely not the best. It's basically just another mediocre vampire film. 5 stars.
Red Notice,2021,6.3,An Interpol agent successfully tracks down the world's most wanted art thief with help from a rival thief. But nothing is as it seems as a series of double-crosses ensues.,"There are far too many convenient events in the film, it is just not believable. It's one unlikely event after another, that it really challenges logic and reality. I didn't quite enjoy the film as a result."
The Office,,9.0,"A mockumentary on a group of typical office workers, where the workday consists of ego clashes, inappropriate behavior, tedium and romance.","Reviewers say 'The Office' is acclaimed for its realistic office life portrayal and relatable characters, fostering a lasting sitcom appeal. Its mockumentary style enhances viewer connection, highlighting themes of workplace relationships and personal growth. Notable dynamics, like Jim and Pam's romance and Michael Scott's management, add charm. The series effectively blends humor with poignant moments, creating a deep audience connection through its unique mix of comedy and heart."
A Million Little Pieces,2018,6.3,A drug-dependent young man faces his past and his inner demons after he is interned in an institution for the addicted.,This tells an a remarkable struggle against substances. His transformation in the rehab is remarkable and pleasing. The number of familiar faces in the film adds to the viewing pleasure as well.
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow,,7.8,"Jack Sparrow and Will Turner try to steal an object from a Portuguese fortress in Panama. They are double-crossed and captured. While facing the gallows, Jack begins to retell some of his stories to Will.","Pirates Of The Caribbean is probably the one of the best movies ever made. So when Bethesda tried making a pirates game... I thought it would suck. Yet I was happily proved wrong and I must say I enjoyed the somewhat short Legend Of Jack Sparrow video game.Gameplay: This game reminded me somewhat of Medevil for PS1 cause it was just a hack and slash game. The graphics were also a bit smudgy and there was a few issues, yet it was very interesting and fun. ( It also reminded me a bit of Freddy Vs. Jason, just hack and slash, yet fun). 7/10Tilt: This game was very short. If you have a free weekend with nothing to do at all, it is good for a quick rental. I wouldn't mind playing it again though if I was bored. 6/10Characters: What is there not to love about Captain Jack Sparrow? Nothing of course. Many love Sparrow so it was very exciting playing his story and seeing all sorts of new character never shown in theaters. Very fun and intense characters. 9/10Overall: A game all should play. Funny and a great way to spend the afternoon. Play if you have the chance, it will suck you in. 8/10P.S. Aargh, if ye fellow shipmates understand this accursed foul language I speak out of me mouth then listen up you scurvy, ugly damned fool. If you have played this game, and seen At World's End pictures then the part where Jack talks about the Chinease trip it might have a thing or two about Pirates III."
City of Lies,2018,6.5,Russell Poole and Jack Jackson investigate the murder of rapper Notorious B.I.G.,"This is a gripping crime thriller about corruption in LAPD. Johnny Depp gave an exceptional performance here after Black Mass. Forest Whitaker did well too. It has shades of JFK movie, but couldn't achieve that greatness. This movie should have been released, it's a shame that it got stuck due to controversy. More people should watch this movie."
Ammonite,2020,6.5,"1840s England, acclaimed but overlooked fossil hunter Mary Anning and a young woman sent to convalesce by the sea develop an intense relationship, altering both of their lives forever.",I just wanna point out that the scenes with no dialogue are the one's that say a lot ... Kate Winslet masters the way she talks only with her eyes.
The Hummingbird Project,2018,6.2,A pair of high-frequency traders go up against their old boss in an effort to make millions in a fiber-optic cable deal.,"I liked this movie a lot. Don't pay much attention to ratings, watch it and decide for yourself, I'm glad I did that. Good movie."
Chocolat,2000,7.2,"Single mother Vianne Rocher and her young daughter arrive in a rural French town in the winter of 1959, and open an unusual chocolate shop that disrupts the moral fiber of the strictly Catholic townsfolk and mayor.","I saw Chocolat again last night. I had forgotten how lovely a movie it is! People need stories like this these days.Some other viewers have complained about the predictability of the plot. I don't think it's any more predictable than an average Hollywood film; I find most action films much more predictable and shallow.The most beautiful thing about the movie (as about Hallstr√∂m movies generally) is the wise, warm-hearted story about things that matter: love, sincerity, tolerance, standing up for the things you believe are righteous and good, and enjoying the simple pleasures in life, like a good dinner with friends, or like chocolate :) And Hallstr√∂m tells his stories so delicately, in his very own style, with fine nuances and a twinkle of humour in his eye. Binoche, Dench, Depp, Molina, Thivisol etc. are fantastic.I'm so glad I saw the movie. It always makes me think and feel a lot."
8-Bit Christmas,2021,6.7,"In 1980s Chicago, a 10-year-old sets out on a quest to get the Christmas gift of his generation: the latest and greatest video-game system.","It's wonderful to be able to watch a lighthearted family friendly movie without having politics rammed down your throat.This is a decent film, suitable for families with younger children (probably around 10 or so) who want to watch something to do with Christmas that will keep the kids entertained.This is worth watching at least once."
The Witches,2020,5.4,A young boy and his grandmother have a run-in with a coven of witches and their leader.,"The original ""The Witches"" is a Childhood Classic that we all grew up watching & the setting & the actual Witches themselves looked way better back then in 1990 than these CGI creations look today in 2021.Robert Zemeckis is an excellent director & he does good here but like every big film today it's overrealiant on CGI affects & even with it's mega budget it doesn't look as good or as richly beautiful as the darker original old Classic. Also the actors were alot better in the original as was the Hotel but as a new version as a fun fantasy adventure it's still a decent watch.Anne Hathaway is good as the main head witch but again got nothing on the scariness of Angelica Huston.The characters have changed to the cast of a Black version which was ok because i liked Chris Rock telling the story & Octavia Spencer is really good as the grandma who takes the little boy to a big beautiful Hotel to escape a Witch encounter but end up right in the middle of a Witches meeting place. Stanley Tucci is fine but felt very subdued & not fun like Rowan Atkinson's Classic part. The kids are fine & the CGI mice are cartoony looking but there is some Magic here & the story is pretty much exactly the same as the original but just not done as great.Still this update is a fun film with decent performances & nice cinematography but it just ain't on the level of that Original Classic."
Sister Act,1992,6.5,"When a nightclub singer is forced to take refuge from the mob in a convent, she ends up turning the convent choir into a soulful chorus complete with a Motown repertoire, until the sudden celebrity of the choir jeopardizes her identity.","I really like this movie and the sequel, this one being the better movie. The third act is silly perhaps, and the crime subplot could have been a little better handled. However, a lot of things make this movie terrific and very entertaining.I just love the songs, they are so upbeat and joyful, and they are wonderfully staged and sung. The nuns are great to watch, they are sweet, innocent and so easy to fall in love with. Whoopi Goldberg is absolutely terrific in the lead, she really gives it her all and it comes through loud and clear. The film looks great too, goes at a good pace and has a decent story and funny and charming script. Also, the direction is competent, and Maggie Smith is a welcome presence.Overall, thoroughly enjoyable and if you haven't seen the West End stage show, do, it's even better. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
The Witches,1990,6.8,"A young boy stumbles onto a witch convention and must stop them, even after he has been turned into a mouse.","This is the genuine article, a children's movie enjoyable by the whole family. It deals with the legends of evil witches by showing children that good overcomes evil. There is a good deal of slapstick and silliness that reminds older folks of the Hal Roach ""Keystone Cops"". However, the silliness never obscures the human message. This is also not a ""Jackass"" film with dangerous stunts for kids to try at home. For a change, love is portrayed as something true and valuable to be desired and pursued. The cast is excellent from top to bottom, with the best actors doing some of their sometimes most understated and often brightest over-the-top work. It has been a family favorite from coast to coast ever since it came out and our extended clan can't recommend it highly enough."
14 Peaks: Nothing Is Impossible,2021,7.7,"Fearless Nepali mountaineer Nirmal Purja embarks on a seemingly impossible quest to summit all 14 of the world's 8,000-meter peaks in seven months.","Utterly awe-inspiring and a reminder of how so many people are ignored and taken for granted.Be like nimsdai and know you are magic, magnificent and capable of even more than you dared dream."
Happiest Season,2020,6.6,"A holiday romantic comedy that captures the range of emotions tied to wanting your family's acceptance, being true to yourself, and trying not to ruin Christmas.","This is a very good movie with a lot of feel good moments. Dan Levy is the man and Kristen Stewart and Mackenzie Davis shine. As a straight man who has never had to hide who I am, I really learned something in this movie and I hope others do too."
Godzilla vs. Kong,2021,6.3,The epic next chapter in the cinematic Monsterverse pits two of the greatest icons in motion picture history against each other--the fearsome Godzilla and the mighty Kong--with humanity caught in the balance.,"Reviewers say 'Godzilla vs. Kong' is celebrated for its stunning visual effects and exhilarating monster battles, offering a feast of action and CGI. Conversely, it is faulted for its flimsy plot, shallow human characters, and incoherent narrative. Many find the story secondary to the combat scenes, resulting in a fragmented and implausible storyline. Despite these drawbacks, the film is deemed enjoyable for audiences craving action and visual grandeur, though it disappoints those hoping for a more compelling plot and richer character arcs."
The Right One,2021,5.3,"Sara, a novelist struggling with writer's block, needs inspiration - and finds it when she meets Godfrey, a down-on-his-luck oddball who constantly changes personas and alter egos in order to cope with his past and avoid reality.","Great story idea. All of the makings of something fun, loving, learning and romantic.The chemistry seemed a little flat. Not exactly there in my opinion. And from time to time I felt irritated by the sound of one's voice and stupid liners from the delivery of one's script in the movie. Did the purposely do that? Or was it the delivery from one's acting skills?. I don't know how and what to make of it.The underlying subject is not easy. And to deal with such matters takes skills and understanding in addressing likely trauma.More exposure from other parties would have likely added more drama and given more picture and emotional expression to this ""wanna be better"" flick.Enjoy."
Mortal Kombat,2021,6.1,MMA fighter Cole Young seeks out Earth's greatest champions in order to stand against the enemies of Outworld in a high stakes battle for the universe.,"Reviewers say 'Mortal Kombat' impresses with special effects and gory fight scenes, faithfully capturing the game's atmosphere. Fans enjoy iconic characters and fatalities, though criticize the simplistic plot and inconsistent acting. The new protagonist, Cole Young, is seen as unnecessary, and the film's pacing and lack of a tournament structure are noted weaknesses. Despite these flaws, the action and visuals are praised, making it enjoyable for fans."
The Unforgivable,2021,7.1,A woman is released from prison after serving a sentence for a violent crime and re-enters a society that refuses to forgive her past.,"I was emotionally invested in this film, which delivered in all the feels. The characters were incredibly well acted and with depth that drew you into the storyline. Well made and unexpected."
The Whole Truth,2021,5.3,"When two siblings stumble on a strange hole in the wall of their grandparents' house, horrifying incidents reveal sinister secrets about their family.","It starts mid-paced, mediocre, middle-of-the-road, like a harmless melodrama. Don't be fooled by the seemingly ""storm in the teacup"" style and scope. There are heaps of clues along the way. Some of them indicative, some misleading. Then, as the plot thickens, twists and turns explode one after another. The excellent execution of the story presents every twist and turn with explanation, all reasonable. Well done, director Wisit Sasanatieng.Every characters other than the protagonists sis and bro look nice and give good first impression. However, they have dark side of their own, as revealed later. The exception: only 3 persons (the school bully, the rich youngster, and the futile husband) NOT look nice when first appeared, because the director portrays them that way, are not that bad as we anticipate. The most ugly of them all, is actually pure and innocent. These delicate arrangements are perfect embodiment of the idea that in our world it's hard to realize the whole truth, unless through a (worm)hole, of a past or even present event. Hence the title of THE WH‚≠ïLE TRUTH (2021).By the way, TWT is typically Thai cinema and a beautiful one. Asian horror movies tend to, IMHO, pay more attention on family value, good manner, morality, etc or even on introspection of their culture/tradition than the actual scary stuff. Therefore, TWT won't keep you at the edge of your seat. It doesn't intend to. Please look away if you prefer mindless killing, jump scare or gore."
Voyagers,2021,5.5,"A crew of astronauts on a multi-generational mission descend into paranoia and madness, not knowing what is real or not.","This movie is actually quite intriguing for the first 40 minutes or so. The set design is excellent, and along with cold emotionless expressions on the actors and shots of the mundane lives of the would-be colonists, helps to establish a plausible set-up with tons of potential. They know they're the first generation of a ship on a multi-generational voyage to colonize another planet, and may also be humanity's last hope of survival. Their grim personas express their awareness of this fact and that the mission is paramount. There's even a mysterious hint at an unexpected presence on the ship to add to the suspense.Don't bother watching the second half though. As a lot of other reviews have mentioned, it tries to adapt a plot similar to Lord of the Flies, however the big difference here is that these teenagers are supposed to have been highly trained for this mission their entire lives, and are literally the future of humanity. They're not a ragtag group of students on a deserted island struggling for survival.I don't think I need to use any spoilers for you to imagine how trying to shoehorn the Lord of the Flies plot into this situation leads to a trainwreck of a last half. The script takes a sharp turn into utter nonsense with ridiculous dialogue and characters actions. It is truly such a pity and a waste of a great set-up.I will say that I was impressed with the performance of Tye Sheridan in particular, and Colin Farrell can rarely do wrong as well. The other main actors were decent at best, or just too weighed down by atrocious dialogue to make anything of their performances.I'd recommend watching the first 40min or so (8/10) and then just walking away and imagining your own conclusion. Anything would be better than what transpired in the last half of Voyagers."
Holidate,2020,6.2,"Fed up with being single on holidays, two strangers agree to be each other's platonic plus-ones all year long, only to catch real feelings along the way.","Well, basically all we need for holiday is Clich√© Holiday RomCom. That's why 'tis the season we're gonna have similar romcom story with different actors yet we still love it. And this movie is actually way better than your average holiday movie. The chemistry between the two main lead is on, and oh their visual are adorable."
Don't Look Up,2021,7.2,Two low-level astronomers must go on a giant media tour to warn humankind of an approaching comet that will destroy planet Earth.,"I don't this movie receives enough credit.However Painful it was to watch, Don't Look Up is a very accurate representation of what the world has become. No matter how much I want to believe otherwise, still I think this is exactly how the planet will react to a similar situation. So, needless to say, I think the story was good :).I also have nothing to say against the acting. Special effects was good. Music was also good. And, it was actually funny most of the time.So what's missing? Why isn't this everyone's favorite movie? Maybe it's just too real! Maybe it's the mirror that shows us exactly how we are, and we just don't like it.Overall, it was a good movie. Perhaps my favorite Netflix production yet!"
Monster Hunter,2020,5.2,"When Cpt. Artemis and her loyal soldiers are transported to a new world, they engage in a desperate battle for survival against enormous enemies with incredible powers. Feature film based on the video game by Capcom.","Great visuals, fast pace, amazing fight scenes and Mila Jovovich equals fun! No plot or anything like that of course but a great ride overall if you are looking for a monster-munch flick to watch! 7/10."
A Boy Called Christmas,2021,6.7,"In this origin story of Father Christmas, an ordinary boy--with a loyal pet mouse and a reindeer at his side--sets out on an extraordinary adventure to find his father, who is on a quest to discover the fabled village of Elfhelm.","What a great way to tell it like this. Beautiful scenery. I love the mountains and the snow. So it was a really feast for me. Its a reall must see. And it was not that scary, so the kids can see it to."
A Quiet Place Part II,2020,7.2,"Following the events at home, the Abbott family now face the terrors of the outside world. Forced to venture into the unknown, they realize the creatures that hunt by sound are not the only threats lurking beyond the sand path.","The good: The film in of itself, is well made - everything from cinematography to lighting, sound, action, pacing etc. Big props for that. And of course the acting from the leads (including the younger actors) is excellent. I also like the way the 'passing of the torch' is shot - clearly defined parallels are drawn that make it easy to see the directors vision.The bad: Probably it's biggest criticism is just how close it is to the 1st part. Whilst containing less of what made the first one special. This film is definitely more action - so it's not a complete replica, but the story beats and plotting are basically the same - hide from aliens, get supplies, escape from or stop aliens, : rinse and repeat.Should you watch it: If you like the first one, absolutely. It's a well constructed film that moves at a quick pace (almost over too quickly). A solid horror action flick. Recommended."
Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts,,8.0,"Cast and crew members from all ""Harry Potter"" films reunite in a retrospective special to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Harry Potter en de steen der wijzen (2001).","""Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts"" is a TV Special in which we watch some of the cast of the ""Harry Potter"" franchise celebrating the 20th Anniversary since the release of the first ""Harry Potter"" movie. There are plenty of interviews and conversations that gives us many insights about the movies.I enjoyed this TV Special very much and I have to admit that I was expecting it anxiously. The combination of the insights that were presented with the cast interviews and all the information given by them, made us understand and see the ""Harry Potter"" franchise form a different perspective. I also liked the way the cast members talked about the show and the presentation of many behind the scenes moments along with some emotional moments. The direction which was made by Eran Creevy, Joe Pearlman and Giorgio Testi was simply amazing and they succeed on traveled us back in time and have the same feeling as the first time watching the Harry Potter and his friends walking at Hogwarts. Finally, I have to say that ""Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts"" is an amazing TV show and I highly recommend everyone to watch it, especially all ""Harry Potter"" fans."
Greenland,2020,6.4,A family struggles for survival in the face of a cataclysmic natural disaster.,"A revival of those 70s disaster films is what we have in Greenland. Who would
have thought that large frozen island up north would be mankind's last hope for survival.There's a large planet destroying comet headed our way and as it hits the atmosphere it burns up and breaks up. The first fragment flattens the Tampa-St.Petersburg area with accompanying firestorms. Is tis how itended for the
dinosaurs?Apparently some plans were made for such an event because engineer Gerard Butler has been chosen in a lottery to be marked for survival. So are his
family which is wife Morena Beccarin and son Roger Dale Floyd. The best scenes
in Greenland are between these people acting and functioning as a real family not some television type family unit.You can make plans, but things often don't go to plan. Especially in a situation
where blind panic takes over. This is the drama of Greenland, one man's family
and their struggle.Nice computer generated special effects are here for those who lay their money
down to see such stuff. But a good story gets me and Greenland has a good story.Not the best of disasterfilms, still a good one."
Por que Voc√™ n√£o Chora?,2020,6.0,"""Why don't you cry?"" addresses the delicate topic of suicide. Jessica is very closed, Barbara is a time bomb. The two look for each other when, at the psychology college internship, Jessica meets Barbara.","Strong and feminine, ""Why don't you cry?"" addresses the delicate topic of suicide. Jessica is very closed, Barbara is a time bomb. The two meet when, at the stage of the faculty of psychology, Jessica meets Barbara. The coexistence leads Jessica to question her empty and meaningless life.The abrupt cuts between scenes bother me a little, the slow pace is not a problem, because the routine imposed in the film enchants, captivates and involves... B√°rbara Paz and Carolina Monte Rosa are simply spectacular, while one acts coldly, the other is explosive, of opposites that attract and infect us, passionate plot, with themes related to psychological disorders, we dive deep into these sad diseases... Based on real facts, sad..."
The Lost Daughter,2021,6.7,A woman's beach vacation takes a dark turn when she begins to confront the troubles of her past.,"Terribly overrated. Flat, strange, meandering, meaningless film. Entitled people who are very dislikeable, complaining about their privileged lives. Olivia Coleman is a selfish older woman and there are many flashbacks of her as a younger selfish woman. This is meant to be a mother ""telling her truth"" about the ugliness of motherhood. Nothing groundbreaking here. Just a boring story of self-absorbed, mindless people."
Intrusion,2021,5.3,"A woman moves to a small town with her husband, but is rattled when she is targeted for a home invasion.","Why are people always looking for something fresh and original? Ok, so it's not an Oscar winner but it's a decent thriller. So what if it's predictable? So what if it's been done before? Not every movie can be the next big thing. With the amount of crapy movies out there (and I mean real crap) it's just not that bad! Definitely doesn't deserve such low ratings! I enjoyed it. It was fine. Decent acting, good pace and an interesting (even if predictable) storyline. Yes, it's been done before but so what? If you're looking for the next big thing, don't watch it but if you want to kill an hour and a half and watch a decent thriller, give it a try."
The Woman in Black,2012,6.4,A young solicitor travels to a remote village where he discovers that the vengeful ghost of a scorned woman is terrorizing the locals.,"OK, I'll admit, I went into this film with not very high expectations, I left on the other hand pleasantly surprised and genuinely creeped out. Daniel Radcliffe, while not the best actor, also exceeded my expectations. The movie theater was packed and people really seemed to be enjoying themselves. People screamed when they were meant to and shivered accordingly. At the end the theater broke out in applause, and it was the most packed theater I've seen since the midnight premiere of Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 2. Walking out into the lobby people were still blown away, and I myself could not believe what just happened. So what I'm saying is, if you're looking for a fun night to be creeped out in an old fashioned horror film sort of way, go see the Woman In Black, you will not be disappointed."
Lucy in the Sky,2019,4.9,"Astronaut Lucy Cola returns to Earth after a transcendent experience during a mission to space, and begins to lose touch with reality in a world that now seems too small.","The real story behind this film is so much more interesting, along with the actual people involved. This easily could have been an engaging study of the real woman, instead of the vague cypher that camera tricks do nothing to explain or enhance."
"Tick, Tick... Boom!",2021,7.5,"On the brink of turning 30, a promising theater composer navigates love, friendship and the pressure to create something great before time runs out.","I liked this movie a lot more than I thought it would.I find that Netflix movies are hard to predict normally they are let downs but this one broke the cycle for me.It was thoughtful. There was obviously research done by everyone involved.Considering this is his directorial debut I do think that he does a good job for the most part. I think some scenes are amazing and will stick but others can be a little plainer.Andrew Garfield is the star of the show though. His performance was fantastic. He really gave into the role. The pretentiousness, the heart, the sadness. He played the typical ""musical theatre nerd"" perfectly. It was so theatrical and over the top which worked. But the moments that called for more depth were also amazing. He was about to really capture the sadness.I was really impressed. The music is as great too. The majority of the songs had a life of their own and felt original. They felt fresh even though this play was wrote in 1990."
12 Mighty Orphans,2021,6.9,"Haunted by his mysterious past, a devoted high-school football coach leads a scrawny team of orphans to the state championship during the Great Depression and inspires a broken nation along the way.","""12 Mighty Orphans"" is one heartfelt feel good stand up and cheer like film as it looks at the life and times of a dozen Orphans in Texas during the 1930's and the great depression era. Set near Forth Wort, Texas an academy and school for the poor and forgotten has opened up and coming in is the start of a football team. Rusty Russell(Luke Wilson) and his teacher wife have came with open arms as he's a coach with a winning resume, and he gets the praise from the school's doctor Doc Hall(the good veteran Martin Sheen). Along the way as the boys enter no matter how troubled or different they bond and learn plenty about life, love, sharing, teamwork, and commitment. Though tough and rocky at first these boys learn the basic fundamentals of blocking and tackling and after some and a few loses the speed and hard work starts to pay off and wins start to follow one by one all the way up to the Texas state championship game! Well done film of how faith and hard work and determination can change life, really a fine film to few with friends or family as when watching all will feel the values of bonding and working together."
Before I Go to Sleep,2014,6.3,"A woman wakes up every day, remembering nothing as a result of a traumatic accident in her past. One day, new terrifying truths emerge that force her to question everyone around her.","""Before I Go To Sleep"" is an effective psychological thriller.Nicole Kidman plays Christine Lucas, someone who if she saw ""50 First Dates"" wouldn't remember it the morning afterwards! She wakes as a forty-something 'housewife' in her suburban home every morning with Ben (Colin Firth) in bed next to her. However, she can remember little to nothing of the last twenty years.She is being covertly helped on a pro-bono basis (with a trace of pro-boner thrown in) by UCL neuro-scientist Dr Nash (Mark Strong). Nash reveals that she ended up in this state after being severely beaten up and left for dead near a Heathrow hotel. He persuades her to maintain a video diary of the days' events and recollections, but he has to remind her where she's hidden the camera via phone every morning.But Christine has a traumatic and terrifying past, remembered (and then immediately forgotten) in dreams, but which only very slowly starts to piece itself together during the waking hours. One character emerging from the mental mist is a long-time college friend Claire (James McAvoy's wife Anne-Marie Duff) who disappeared from her life under mysterious circumstances but is now 'found' again.Will Christine piece together the jigsaw? What was she doing in the Heathrow hotel? Who beat her up and why? Where does Claire fit in? Can Mark Strong play anything other than a 'baddie'? So many questions, so little memory.Produced by Ridley Scott and with Rowan Joffe (""28 Weeks Later"") writing the screenplay and directing, the film is pleasingly set in and around a non-touristy London with some fine scenic shots - you can't really beat the view from the Royal Greenwich Observatory, and this nicely features in one scene. Nicole Kidman has a lot of acting to do in this role and she does it very well. Firth and Strong - two of my favourite actors - are both excellent and keep you guessing throughout. But of all of the acting roles I found Anne-Marie Duff particularly effective in the short-and-sweet role of Claire: a very powerful and touching performance.It is tempting to describe any psycho-thriller as 'Hitchcockian', but there are moments where this film can certainly be tagged in this way. This is helped by a Bernard Herrmann-like score by Ed Shearmur, moody photography by Ben Davis and crisp editing by Melanie Oliver.I enjoyed this film, but even with all of these positives it still felt more like a B-movie than an A-movie for reasons I can't quite sum up. In addition there were a few niggling plot points and, in my opinion, a slightly weak epilogue ending. Also note that, in a world where far too many women still face physical violence, there are flashback scenes in this film that some may find distressing, earning it its '15' UK certificate.(Please see my other film reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and sign up to ""Follow the Fad"". Thanks.)"
Druk,2020,7.7,Four high-school teachers consume alcohol on a daily basis to see how it affects their social and professional lives.,"I enjoyed Thomas Vintenberg's ""Another Round"".Why? Maybe because I'm an introverted guy drowining his introverted sorrow in pints of beer, wine, vodka... but not whisky. Or maybe because I'm a teacher and I can relate to being confronted to a class whose deadly silence is a severe blow to my pride. Or maybe because I'm kind of a simp when it comes to women, whether the first or the second. Or maybe because I already used alcohol to fuel some positive energy... and that it worked. Anyway I was the perfect candidate to enjoy it and I enjoyed it so much that I'm willing to do an experiment (I did one for ""Festen"", check the review).Since the film is about four men and teachers (with their own issues and marital troubles): history teacher Martin (Mads Mikkelsen), P. E. teacher Tommy (Thomas Bo Larsen), philo Nikolaj (Magnus Millang) and Music Peter (Lars Ranthe) decide to prove a theory that implies a man's alcool level at 0,5g maintains or improves his social skills and creativity, that state between drunkenness and soberness. I'm willing to do a similar test and advance in that review after several drinks. This is not an endorsement of drinking, no more or less than the film but let's do it for fun. See you later.Well, here we are, two small beers, I guess I'm there at 0,5g. How does that affect my writing I don't know. I just want to take an opportunity to say that I could really relate to the scenes that depicted every single stage of inebriation by Vintenberg. From the way, you start stumbling and looking for the right word, or just talking loudly and smiling to the way you start loosen up. There's a real portrayal of alcohol effect that takes me back to the first time I drunk, drank, whatever, when my cousin asked me to approach a girl and I was shy, it took one bottle of Malibu pineapple and the magic operated, placebo, maybe. Anyway, I could relate to the character of Mark, he's lost his appeal with his wife and girls and one glass of wine is enough to bring back the worst and anaesthetize it. Alcohol becomes the remedy to the very thoughts it catalyses, strange but true.Having said that, I dream to be a filmmaker and one of the film I dreamed of making since 12 years involve a long sequence of guys drinking and dancing and a climactic catastrophe dancing that is almost like Madds at the end. And so for the record, I want to make it clear, if I ever make such a film, please don't accuse me to make a rip-off. I swear I had it in mind years and years before. Let's hope this will serve a purpose.Where was I? Just had two and half glasses of wine. I guess I'm in a stage where my mind floats in total lucidity, and I already feel silly about the former paragraph... how about just making a film without caring about any accusation of plagiarism. What Vintenberg did was more than offer a platform of expression to average guys who want to be heard in a world where it's about the pleas of youngsters or women, I suspected Vintenberg was a fan of ""The Deeer Hunter"" when I saw ""The Hunt"": you know, male-bonding etc. , the drunk scenes especially when they want to literally go the distance is just like the bar scene pushed to eleven... men behaving like a children, he wife wants a fresh fish, how about fishing it... I like the way Vintenberg use the process of handheld camera to exteriorize the drunken effect like Harvey Keitel's ""Rubber Sandwich"" scene in ""Mean Streets"".The directing, rightfully Oscar-nominated is both subjective and objective, it shows the state of mind, shows the way they look at their own entourage, whether kids laughing at their jokes or women telling them to calm down and it shows a certain reality about couples, exams, needs for existence and that found a perfect loophole with alcohol. Does the film advocate the drinking? Well given the most extreme scenario and the fact that a man wets his own bed and Marcus ends up laying on the ground, I doubt so... but what Vintenberg does is acknowledge that there's a reason for existence (remember what Homer Simpson said?) and he doesn't back up in the controversial scene where a teacher advices a student to drink before answering, it can help... I'll be back...Now, I guess I got to the limit, my head is heavier and I'm tired. Maybe that' what consumption is about, there's an aftershock, something to bite you back that is called reality... Vintenberg draws the line between reality as it seems and the the virtual universe we fabricate to improve or please ourselves.... I was perplex about the ending, why cut the focus from the experience and leave us with the aftermath of the first booze orgy... maybe Vintenberg settles a personal record with destiny (check the trivia) and out of honesty decided to show that alcohol is a life-and-death issue whether physical or ""social"" death. Still the same...However the ending that seems to embrace the energy boost of alcohol within the students and their intergenerational communion with teachers suggests a social cement, a rite of passage, as wicked as it is, it exists and that one should handle it with responsibility. It's interesting that if Marcus could get his wife to notice him with alcohol, her comeback is due to one moment where he chose to be sober... and maybe there's a certain sternness, a strength in that sate that can take you further in life... and watching the quality of the directing, I was sure there was no alcohol involved during the filming.Think about it before calling the film an ode to alcohol? Off to bed now..."
The Ice Road,2021,5.6,"After a remote diamond mine collapses in far northern Canada, a 'big-rig' ice road driver must lead an impossible rescue mission over a frozen lake to save the trapped miners.","Yes it's not ""My Dinner with Andre"" or ""Mindwalk"", but is a Liam Neeson, Saturday afternoon beer drinking action movie. It's pure escapism from S-show that is America 2021."
The Tinder Swindler,2022,7.1,"Posing as a wealthy, jet-setting diamond mogul, he wooed women online, then conned them out of millions of dollars. Now some victims plan for payback.","I watched in disbelief. I know that there are swindlers and schemers out there. What amazed me was that the first woman that was interviewed agreed to fly on the perpetrator's private jet within hours of meeting him. She slept with him the same night. Subsequently, their relationship is mainly through calls and texts, and she believes that she is in a relationship. I believe if she had exercised some discretion, she wouldn't have been swindled from hundreds of thousands of dollars. Was she so quick to throw caution to the wind simply because he seemed like he had lots of money? Of course it's sad that people are being duped this way, but I'm having a hard time feeling sorry for these women."
Snake Eyes: G.I. Joe Origins,2021,5.4,"Snake Eyes, a tenacious loner, is welcomed into an ancient Japanese clan called the Arashikage, who teach him the ways of the ninja and provide him home. But when secrets from his past are revealed, his honor and allegiance will be tested.","Having grown up with the ""G. I. Joe"" cartoons on TV and always liked them, I must say that my expectations for this 2021 movie ""Snake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins"" weren't exactly sky high, given the previous live action movies based on the cartoons.But still, of course I sat down to watch this movie and see what writers Evan Spiliotopoulos, Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse would come up with.And while ""Snake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins"" certainly was a watchable movie, this was essentially a no-brainer. You just disconnect your brain, lean back and munch the popcorn while watching the action on the screen. In terms of proper contents for a deeper storyline or a fulfilling storyline, then ""Snake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins"" is not the movie you should watch. Nay, this was just mindless action with a ""G. I. Joe"" template dragged down over it to sell it to a wider audience.I must admit that I sit here with a feeling of this being a rather unnecessary and unfulfilling movie, now that the movie came to an end. Sure, the movie was a cheesy action flick and watchable enough for what it turned out to be. But this was by no means an outstanding movie from director Robert Schwentke.The action sequences in the movie are good, and they are what keeps the movie afloat. That, and also some nice visuals and special effects. But other than that, then this movie was a shallow shell.The cast ensemble was interesting, though, I will say that much. I am not familiar with Henry Golding, but he did a good job at bringing Snake Eyes to life on the screen. And actor Andrew Koji was definitely a good choice for Stormshadow. Now, it was really great to see the likes of Iko Uwais and Haruka Abe in the movie as well.I doubt that I will ever return to watch ""Snake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins"" a second time, because the storyline just barely had enough contents to support the first viewing.My rating of ""Snake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins"" lands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars."
Last Christmas,2019,6.5,"Kate is a young woman subscribed to bad decisions. Working as an elf in a year-round Christmas store is not good for the wannabe singer. However, she meets Tom there. Her life takes a new turn--that seems too good to be true.","I really want to say I liked Last Christmas - Henry Golding is disarmingly charming, the happiness is helping other people message is sweet. This is how a Christmas film should be....you laugh, cry, laugh some more ...with a theatre full of strangers who are doing exactly the same. Not ashamed to say I loved it."
Scenes of a Sexual Nature,2006,5.9,"Sex and love. Some seek it, some need it, some spurn it, and some pay for it, but we're all involved in it. Set on one afternoon on Hampstead Heath, London, this movie investigates the minutiae of seven couples. What makes us tick?","A sunny afternoon on Hamstead Heath in London sees couples everywhere. Some of them are breaking up with arguments others are breaking up with affection. Some see ogling others as a betrayal, others see it as part of life. Strangers are thrown together in a temporary moment while others come together for the first time in many years. Love and sex play a part in all of it as the sun warms the day in the background.It was the ensemble nature of the film that drew my attention to it despite the fact that it got mixed reviews. I didn't get round to it in the cinemas but when it came on television recently I managed to check it out. The mixed reviews I mentioned are perhaps understandable because the film itself is the same way in terms of content, quality and success. The ""plot"" doesn't really flow together because the only tangible connection between the couples is the location however as a device it has potential. The lack of a traditional narrative means that the film really relies heavily on the creation of characters and snapshots to paint a bigger picture of relationships and interactions that will come together thematically in the way that the specific characters do not. Here and there it does sort of do it but too often the scenes are just distracting as stand alone scenes, which is all well and good to some degree but it doesn't work as it needs to.I could forgive many of the specific scenes lacking meaning but, unlike some reviews, I do see the absence of a wider truth to be a bit of an issue and without this the individual scenes have a lot more weight put on them. Sadly few if any of them can really stand up to the pressure and mostly the film just comes across as fragmented and disjointed with the strongest scenes being amusing or mildly engaging while at worst they are so-so but just seem pointless and far too underdeveloped. It is a shame because the cast is impressive and they have the talent to do as much as the material could have asked of them and it is a shame that the material asks little of the majority. McGregor, Okonedo, Tate, Lester, Strong, McKee and Bonneville are the main people you will recognise but the rest of the cast are just as good (or rather, just as OK) although it is Rembauville-Nicolle that sticks in the mind for obvious reasons ¬ñ which is depressing when you think of the acting talent involved. It isn't their fault and I can understand why so many of them worked on the film for little money but the idea doesn't come through and mostly they are left to try and carry scenes with their performances but little else.Overall then this is a distracting film that offers intermittent pleasures and interest but mostly fails to offer much in the way of honesty and cohesion. Despite the material the cast do try hard to make it more than it is but with little time on screen and seemingly nobody pulling everyone together in the editing suite I'm afraid it is significantly less than the sum of its many parts."
Jay and Silent Bob Reboot,2019,5.6,Jay and Silent Bob inadvertently sign away their names and rights to the new Bluntman and Chronic movie. Now they head to Hollywood to stop the film from being made. Along the way Jay discovers that he is a father.,"There's just enough Nostalgia to make me finish it though I feel stupider for doing so. Bad acting, lazy script and jokes that just don't land that pretty much sums up this hopefully last outing"
Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard,2021,6.1,"The bodyguard, Michael Bryce, continues his friendship with assassin, Darius Kincaid, as they try to save Darius' wife Sonia.","My wife and I settled into a nice evening looking for light, funny entertainment, so we spun up this BluRay disc from our public library. We got almost halfway when I hit 'pause' and asked, ""Are you enjoying this movie?"" She wasn't and I had only gone that far because she was still in the room.On the surface the story has elements necessary to make an entertaining movie, an unlikely team of three have the task of tracking down the bad guys and saving the world. But we were overwhelmed right away by two big problems:First all the dialog is filled with filthy language, not just a little but seemingly the script tries to put as much filthy language as is possible. Just for the sake of filling the script with filthy language. All the way through the movie. For us it would be like trying to have a nice steak at a restaurant and the waiter coming by every 30 seconds and spraying pepper sauce into our faces. Now we're not prudes, but when dialog has such pervasive filthy language then soon all meaning goes away because we find ourselves wondering ""Why do they think so much filthy language is entertaining?""The second big problem is one scene after the other after the other with gun battles. From start to finish (I skipped around after the 45 minute mark to get a feel for how the second half of the movie is presented) all we get is shooting and more shooting. Just so much that soon all meaning of the story goes away.Now we realize some viewers really like this sort of stuff, they are entertained by it, but to us it is a mystery. There are so many good TV shows and movies, how can someone be entertained by this sort of movie? We can't comprehend it."
The Little Things,2021,6.3,A deputy sheriff and a sergeant search for a serial killer who's terrorizing Los Angeles.,"Joe Deacon, A Deputy Sherriff in a regional police force, is sent to LA to fetch some evidence for a case. In LA he is reunited with many former colleagues as he was a homicide detective there. He is also drawn into a perplexing serial killer case, the details of which are very familiar.Reasonably interesting, though had the potential to be brilliant. Started off well, with decent character development and an intriguing plot. Good casting and performances too. Denzel Washington puts in his usual solid performance, Rami Malek is good and Jered Leto does what he does best - act as a weird, off-the-wall character.However, just when this looks set to be heading for something fantastic, cracks start to appear. The plot is less watertight and plausible and then it suddenly takes a rather tangential direction. This direction could have been a masterstroke if handled correctly but unfortunately it isn't. The ending is quite the damp squib. It is dressed up to appear quite profound but it isn't.So quite disappointing in the end. If writer-director John Lee Hancock had stuck with the initial plot and made a tension-filled crime drama this could have been great. Instead he tries to take it in another direction and while this is more original, his plot is weak, making for an unsatisfying conclusion."
The Girlfriend Experience,,6.9,"Explores the relationships between exclusive escorts and their clients, for whom they provide far more than just sex. Known as GFEs, they are women who provide emotional and sexual relationships at a very high price.","I loved season 1 but I have no idea what they were thinking this season. It is boring as hell and I want the story line from season 1 back please. Season 2 is a mess.....it is uncomfortable and just plain boring to watch. Riley Keough in season 1 was so good. She is beautiful, dark, and mischievous. She really carried this show. Louisa Krause in season 2 is not suited for a part like this. I am so mad this show has been ruined."
The Worst Person in the World,2021,7.7,"The chronicles of four years in the life of Julie, a young woman who navigates the troubled waters of her love life and struggles to find her career path, leading her to take a realistic look at who she really is.","An achingly human & frighteningly accurate portrait of an entire generation's existential crisis, The Worst Person in the World observes millennial angst through a young woman's quest for love & meaning as she enters into her 30s without any idea about her identity & purpose in life. Crafted with flair & told with utmost honesty, this contemporary rom-com is one of the better films of the year.Co-written & directed by Joachim Trier, the story is narrated in chapters and covers her four years journey of love & enlightenment in which we see her throw herself into different career paths & new relationships yet never going all the way. While most episodes are interesting & aptly address the film's themes, few of them are way too brief and should've been either left out or integrated with others.The first half is lighthearted & brimming with a restless, radiant spirit while the later chapters deal with heavier themes and are treated with required seriousness. Renate Reinsve anchors the film with a performance that hits the right emotional notes and is thoroughly convincing. Anders Danielsen Lie & Herbert Nordrum also chip in with strong support and their chemistry with Reinsve is seamless & spot-on.Overall, The Worst Person in the World is a downright sincere & thoroughly engrossing effort that renders the humanity of its characters with authenticity & compassion. Heartbreaking yet not without hope, this Norwegian dramedy understands the dreaded existential cul-de-sac that comes from not knowing who you are or where you fit in as well as the the crushing feeling of playing a supporting role in your own life story."
The White Lotus,,8.0,The exploits of various guests and employees of a luxury resort over the span of a week.,"Reviewers say 'The White Lotus' is a polarizing show with mixed sentiments. Many praise its unique storytelling, dark humor, and social satire, highlighting themes of wealth and privilege. Performances by Jennifer Coolidge and Murray Bartlett are lauded, along with the cinematography, setting, and music. However, some find the characters unlikable and the plot lacking, criticizing the slow pace and shallow character development. Despite these criticisms, the show's ability to provoke thought and discussion is often noted."
Atonement,2007,7.8,Thirteen-year-old fledgling writer Briony Tallis irrevocably changes the course of several lives when she accuses her older sister's lover of a crime he did not commit.,"I saw a preview of this film yesterday and felt privileged to be one of the first people to see the film. It was also a pleasure to see a film before reading any other critical review or opinion. I am a great fan of Ian Mcewan and was concerned that it would not be possible to capture the subtleties and nuances of Mcewan's writing but I needn't have had any worries. The director, Joe Wright and screenplay writer Christopher Hampton have done a superb job and the complexities of the novel are superbly captured with real imagination. The story is set in three main areas, an English country house in 1935, war torn France 1940 and London 1940. The atmosphere in of all three are wonderfully captured by the director, cinematographer, costume design and score and I am sure that there are going to be some Oscar nominations for these. James McAvoy as lead man gives a tremendous performance of a restrained but passionate man. I was not as convinced by Keira Knightley's performance and am not sure that her acting has the mature edge to capture the social nuances of the times that McAvoy did so successfully. Do not see this film if you like fast paced films and rapid plot development! This is not a film for the pop video generation. If however you like character development and a plot that unravels at a pace that allows you to be immersed in the atmosphere of the film then I can highly recommend Atonement as one of the best films that I have seen this year."
Pride & Prejudice,2005,7.8,"When Elizabeth Bennet meets the handsome Mr. Darcy, she believes he is the last man she could ever marry, but as their lives become intertwined, she finds herself captivated by the man she has sworn to hate forever.","Reviewers say 'Pride and Prejudice' (2005) is lauded for its cinematography, scenery, and performances by Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen. Critics note deviations from Austen's novel, including dialogue and character changes. The modern interpretation and runtime are both celebrated and criticized. The chemistry between the leads and emotional impact are highlighted, though some find the portrayal less convincing than previous adaptations. Overall, it's an enjoyable yet imperfect adaptation."
We Broke Up,2021,5.2,"Longtime couple Lori and Doug break up just days before Lori's little sister Bea's wedding to Jayson. In order to not disrupt the fun, they decide to pretend they're still together until the weekend is over.","This was in the comedy section. Not only was it depressing, it never really went anywhere. The female lead (Lori) was totally unlikeable and I really couldn't figure out why the male lead (Doug) would stay with her anyway."
His Dark Materials,,7.8,A young girl is destined to liberate her world from the grip of the Magisterium which represses people's ties to magic and their animal spirits known as daemons.,"Reviewers say 'His Dark Materials' is lauded for its strong performances, particularly from Dafne Keen and Ruth Wilson, and its impressive visual effects and production design. However, some critics find the adaptation lacking in character development, pacing, and faithfulness to the original books. The series explores complex themes like identity and morality, though these are not always effectively conveyed. The show's visual style and world-building are often highlighted, but opinions on their translation from books to screen are mixed."
EDtv,1999,6.1,A video store clerk agrees to have his life filmed by a camera crew for a television show.,"EdTv is a comedy, but also a very serious movie: if you notice our reality in the present days, full of cameras watching us everywhere we go, and even the reality show programs, you will notice that the main thing in the movie is not only to entertain, but maybe also to alert people about the dangerous problems of all this stuff. Ed Pekurny is a regular guy who suddenly gets invited to be part of a reality show. He accepts,specially because he wants the money that the TV executives are going to pay him. Gradually, what starts being funny and even a nice way of popularity becomes a nightmare,with Ed not having any privacy at all,specially with his girlfriend Shari.I found the end of this movie very cool. Go watch it :)"
Preparations to Be Together for an Unknown Period of Time,2020,6.5,"M√°rta, a forty-year-old neurosurgeon, falls in love. She leaves her shining American career behind and returns to Budapest to start a new life with the man. But the love of her life claims they have never met before.",Thus is a superbly executed and beautifully acted psychological mystery involving a lonely Hungarian doctor and her relocation from the USA back to Hungary to follow through on a new romance. There are immediate complications and one quickly wonders if she has imagined the whole affair due to mental illness. The two leads deliver wonderfully understated performances and there are some erotic set pieces that are clever in conception and playful in their choreography. I was spellbound throughout the film and felt great empathy for the lead character and her anguished search for a resolution to the mystery at the heart of events.
The Matrix Resurrections,2021,5.6,"Return to a world of two realities: one, everyday life; the other, what lies behind it. To find out if his reality is a construct, to truly know himself, Mr. Anderson will have to choose to follow the white rabbit once more.","Reviewers say 'The Matrix Resurrections' delves into love, reality, and technology, emphasizing Neo and Trinity's bond. Critics commend the visual effects and action scenes but criticize its reliance on nostalgia and meta-references. Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss's return is lauded, yet new characters and plot points are deemed insufficient. The film is viewed as a mixed addition, with some appreciating its self-awareness and others lamenting its failure to match the original's innovation. Overall, 'The Matrix Resurrections' is a decent franchise installment, though it falls short of the first movie's impact."
Kimi,2022,6.3,An agoraphobic Seattle tech worker uncovers evidence of a crime.,"This was an entertaining hour and a half but its was missing something. There are some interesting characters, a nice enough plot line, a decent character reveal and an entertaining conclusion. Unfortunately, it felt a touch glossed over, simplified. A touch more complexity, a bit more depth would have made this something special. As it was, it's still worth a watch, but it won't wow you."
Girls,,7.4,A comedy about the experiences of a group of girls in their early 20s.,"I am a straight (if that matters...) 30-something guy and I just watched the first five episodes of HBO's ""GIRLS"". So in a nutshell:I really dig this show. I think it has an extremely unique vibe to it, that kinda reminds me of ""How to make it in America"" (with a pinch of Woody Allen). It's nothing like ""Sex and the City""... well it's about a group of Girlfriends, that happen to live in New York City and well... yes Sex is an issue. But still, it's nothing like ""SATC"". It's much more down-to-earth, realistic and... different. I like all the girls and their facets. The casting is great. Though they work with some (New York) clich√©s in the show, I really have the feeling that I know people like that from my own life and experiences. The early 20s, an age where you're on your own for the first time of your life, grown up but still clueless about life and what to expect from it. It's kind of an adventure to figure out who you are, what you want and where to go. I really feel that ""GIRLS"" makes a great job capturing that feeling. Lena Dunham, creator, director and protagonist of this show is crazy talented. People will hear (even more) from her in the future. Mark my words.Hopefully HBO won't axe this show as they did with ""How to make it..."". It's a great show and I really enjoy watching it."
House at the End of the Street,2012,5.5,"After moving with her mother to a small town, a teenager finds that an accident happened in the house at the end of the street. Things get more complicated when she befriends a boy. A double murder is not an accident.","I went to see HOUSE AT THE END OF THE STREET last night and didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped I would. The story is dull and predictable and the acting isn't rocksolid!Jennifer Lawrence played her role well though, she ""blows"" everyone away in this movie BUT, on the other hand, and I don't want to sound too negative, this flick wasn't a very hard nut for her to crack!The story ;Elissa (Lawrence) moves into a new home together with her mom Sarah(Elisabeth Shue) and finds out that the son of a murdered couple, who lived next door, still lives in the house where his parents were killed. The surrounding neigbours complain about him and tell Elissa that the boy is bad news! She wants to find out herself though and steps into his life...It's a not a very bad movie but skip the theatre and wait for it on bluray/DVD."
The Adam Project,2022,6.7,"After accidentally crash-landing in 2022, time-traveling fighter pilot Adam Reed teams up with his 12-year-old self for a mission to save the future.","This isn't going to win any Oscars, and it is far from a perfect time travel movie, but it was a fun ride. Kept my interest all the way through and had a good cast."
The Power of the Dog,2021,6.8,"Charismatic rancher Phil Burbank inspires fear and awe in those around him. When his brother brings home a new wife and her son, Phil torments them until he finds himself exposed to the possibility of love.","If one makes a character drama then one needs 2 things:1 Great characters. They succeeded somewhat in portraying true to life characters, with good acting performances.2 Intense drama. NONE is to be found though. What a bummer.So what we have here is a polished portrait of good actors in a story that simply never becomes a real human drama. Simply lacklustre. Kinda tedious. Such a pity of the waste of many good actors..."
Dune,2021,8.0,"Paul Atreides arrives on Arrakis after his father accepts the stewardship of the dangerous planet. However, chaos ensues after a betrayal as forces clash to control melange, a precious resource.","Reviewers say 'Dune' is visually stunning with impressive cinematography, special effects, and a powerful score. The film is praised for its world-building and immersive experience. However, criticisms include slow pacing, underdeveloped characters, and a lack of emotional resonance. Some feel the story is incomplete and lacks a satisfying conclusion due to it being Part One. Mixed opinions exist on casting choices and character portrayals. Despite these issues, many are excited for the sequel's potential."
Phoenix Rising,,7.2,Actress and activist Evan Rachel Wood's experience as a survivor of domestic abuse and her pursuit of justice,"Reviewers say 'Phoenix Rising' presents Evan Rachel Wood's harrowing account of alleged abuse, exploring psychological and sexual abuse, Hollywood power dynamics, and the quest for justice and healing. The documentary is lauded for its raw portrayal but criticized for being one-sided and manipulative. Authenticity and motivations are questioned, yet Wood is commended for her bravery. The film sparks discussions on broader industry abuse and survivor challenges."
Superintelligence,2020,5.5,"When an all-powerful Superintelligence chooses to study average Carol Peters, the fate of the world hangs in the balance. As the A.I. decides to enslave, save or destroy humanity, it's up to Carol to prove that people are worth saving.","This is a rom-com not a sci-fi movie. It's just a fun little romp, take it for what it's worth. I did take an entire star away for spelling Pike Place Market wrong. üòÅ"
The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It,2021,6.3,"Arne Cheyenne Johnson stabs and murders his landlord, claiming to be under demonic possession while Ed and Lorraine Warren investigate the case and try to prove his innocence.","Reviewers say 'The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It' receives mixed feedback. Many commend Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson for their strong performances, yet some criticize the film for its lack of scares and originality. Disappointments include a dull, predictable storyline and a decline in horror quality. Direction and writing are faulted for relying on familiar tropes. Still, some viewers enjoy suspenseful moments and the Warren characters' charm."
Icahn: The Restless Billionaire,2022,7.0,"Explores the fascinating contradictions at the heart of the famed financier, Carl Icahn. Amassing close to $20 billion dollars over the last half century and at the forefront of some of the most legendary business deals of our times.","He contacted me on April, 2024 , to join his Class and interduce him self as Carl Icahn ,
He said I can trust him picking the winning Stock ,
It was a Scam he told me to invest $110,000 In a Stock , the same day I bought the Stock it crashed and I lost all my money , it was a big Scam from him,
My Attorney is going after him ,
He is a very big Scam,
I tried to call him so many time he never answer the phone and keep tilling me I can leave a massage and he calls me back but he never did,
I still have all his class lesson, his phone number he used , I'm going to sue him for what he did to me.He is a big Scamer and Lier ,
And I hope he is not going to do what he did to me to some other people and steals their money."
Class Divide,2015,7.3,Documentary about class division and gentrification in the West Chelsea neighborhood of New York City and its effects on public housing.,"I been watching this movie over the last several days and this gives you the insight of Modern New York City especially the families that live in that area of Chelsea. At one time it was a gritty neighborhood which is now transform into a good community thanks to a school called Avenues that is across the Street from the housing projects where the poor folks live. They are the stars of film because they simply have ambitions of wanting to attend the school which sadly it cause $40,000 to attend. For the poor folks this is a opportunity for them to be part of the school that could help them lead to greater successes & plus get their parents out of the housing projects. The star of the film is Rose such sweet child of ambitions I sincerely hope one day will attend Avenues school. She may be nine or 10 now but I'm sure she'll one day attend that school."
Dan in Real Life,2007,6.8,A widower finds out the woman he fell in love with is his brother's girlfriend.,"The most satisfying element about ""Dan in Real Life"" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) makes sense and is beautifully realistic. The casting of Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche as Dan's love interest was a superb decision; she is exceptionally talented, intelligent, naturally attractive and, thank goodness, appropriately aged for the part! Had this movie been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a disaster.Another wonderful aspect about ""Dan in Real Life"" is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the ""frat pack"" formula: dumb chicks, chauvinistic guys, and sleazy jokes. ""Dan in Real Life"" is witty and has fun, intelligent laughs throughout. Whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing, the jokes from ""Dan in Real Life"" are more natural and clever, and involve some thinking on the part of the audience.My only problem with ""Dan in Real Life"" is that the rebellious, middle daughter is played too outrageously by actress Brittany Robertson. It's difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director. Either way, her character is unrealistic and annoying. But, this is only a minor flaw in the film, and does not take away from the story as a whole.All in all, ""Dan in Real Life"" is a great film, a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed-down comedies. The quality of the writing, directing, acting, and (especially) cinematography is excellent. It is simply a beautiful, light-hearted comedy."
Simple as Water,2021,6.9,A meditation on the elemental bonds of family told through portraits of four Syrian families in the aftermath of war.,"As long as we are surrounded by people who are against refugees, political asylums, immigrants in this world, we will have to continue to watch and feel the pain and suffering of families and children. They are JUST looking for a place of peace and comfort to live.It is incomprehensible that in the 21st century, there are people and groups that act and support men like Trump, Bashar Al-Assad, Bolsonaro, Putin, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong-un, Boris Johnson, Andrzej Duda, Sergio Mattarella, Nicol√°s Maduro who separate families in the name of power. Even sadder must be the wives and children of these empathic and mentally ill leaders.The documentary does not bring any new facts that we haven't seen in the news, media. It just follows the lives of Syrian refugees fighting for a place in the sun."
Heidi Fleiss: The Would-Be Madam of Crystal,,5.1,"A look at the creation of former Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss' latest venture, a Nevada-based male brothel called Heidi's Stud Farm, which caters to female client√®le.","If you are going to watch this expecting lots of steamy sex, think again. It mostly focuses on Heidi's downfall and attempts to rise back up again. She purchases some land in Nevada to build her Stud Farm to serve female clients and the focus is on her interactions with the locals and her own chaotic, lonely life. It is actually kind of sad and poignant. Not something you would expect from the Madam of Hollywood, who did business with some of the most powerful people in the industry. Now, she's alone and we see her flailing about, trying to resurrect past glories, shamelessly promoting herself, but it comes off as kind of pathetic. By the end, you are pretty certain she will not succeed in her original quest, but maybe she will find a little serentity along the way"
The Suicide Squad,2021,7.2,"Supervillains Harley Quinn, Bloodsport, Peacemaker, and a collection of nutty cons at Belle Reve prison join the super-secret, super-shady Task Force X as they are dropped off at the remote, enemy-infused island of Corto Maltese.","Reviewers say 'The Suicide Squad' is an improvement with praised humor, action, and gore. Margot Robbie and Idris Elba's performances are lauded. However, some find it tonally inconsistent and meandering. The R-rating allows for creative violence. Despite positive reviews, some find it overly long and lacking character development. Special and practical effects are highlighted. Overall, it's a fun yet flawed DC addition."
Reminiscence,2021,5.9,"Nick Bannister, a private investigator of the mind, navigates the alluring world of the past when his life is changed by new client Mae. A simple case becomes an obsession after she disappears and he fights to learn the truth about her.","Reviewers say 'Reminiscence' offers a dystopian sci-fi noir with a compelling premise about memory and lost love. While the concept is praised, the script is criticized for clich√©s and slow pacing. Performances by Jackman, Ferguson, and Newton receive mixed reviews, with some appreciating their efforts and others finding them underdeveloped. Cinematography and effects are decent but unexceptional. The film is ambitious yet hindered by its script and pacing."
Escape Room: Tournament of Champions,2021,5.7,"Six people unwillingly find themselves locked in another series of escape rooms, slowly uncovering what they have in common to survive. Joining forces with two of the original survivors, they soon discover they've all played the game before.","This film is still intense, but has less rooms than the first film. It's adequately thrilling."
The Batman,2022,7.8,"When a sadistic serial killer begins murdering key political figures in Gotham, the Batman is forced to investigate the city's hidden corruption and question his family's involvement.","Reviewers say 'The Batman' features intense violence, mature themes, and complex moral dilemmas, making it potentially sensitive for teenagers. The film explores dark Gotham City, delving into vengeance, justice, and trauma's psychological impact. Some find its pacing and length tedious, possibly losing younger audiences' attention. It incorporates contemporary politics and social commentary, which may be challenging for teens. Batman's portrayal as a flawed, human character rather than an infallible hero might also be a sensitive point for some viewers."
Derry Girls,,8.5,The personal exploits of a 16-year-old girl and her family and friends during the Troubles in the early 1990s in Northern Ireland.,"Reviewers say 'Derry Girls' is acclaimed for its humor, heart, and historical context set in 1990s Northern Ireland during the Troubles. It explores teenage challenges, friendship, and political turmoil's impact on daily life. Characters Erin, Orla, Clare, Michelle, and James are celebrated for their dynamic chemistry, adding comedic and emotional depth. Supporting roles like Sister Michael and Grandad Joe enhance the show's humor and relatability. The series balances laughter with poignant moments, making it both entertaining and thought-provoking."
Peacemaker,,8.3,"Picking up where The Suicide Squad (2021) left off, Peacemaker returns home after recovering from his encounter with Bloodsport - only to discover that his freedom comes at a price.","Reviewers say 'Peacemaker' is a standout superhero series with humor, action, and drama. John Cena's performance is praised for charm and depth. The show's irreverent tone and R-rated content are refreshing. James Gunn's direction and writing are acclaimed for balancing comedy with serious themes. The ensemble cast, especially Vigilante and Adebayo, delivers strong performances. Critics appreciate character development and complex themes, though some find humor and social commentary excessive. It's a fun, entertaining take on the superhero genre."
No Time to Die,2021,7.3,"James Bond has left active service. His peace is short-lived when Felix Leiter, an old friend from the CIA, turns up asking for help, leading Bond onto the trail of a mysterious villain armed with dangerous new technology.","Reviewers say 'No Time to Die' is a divisive film with mixed opinions. Many praise Daniel Craig's performance, noting emotional depth and physical intensity. Action sequences and stunts are standout elements. Criticisms include length, pacing issues, and plot execution. Some find Rami Malek's villain underwhelming. Bond's love interest and new characters receive mixed reactions. Despite criticisms, many appreciate it as a fitting conclusion to Craig's tenure, though some feel it falls short of the franchise's best entries."
The Courier,2020,7.2,Businessman Greville Wynne is asked by a Russian source to try to help put an end to the Cuban Missile Crisis.,"A surprisingly good watch, with it being nice to see Mr Cumberbatch in a role that isn't a Marvel green screen epic.I recommend this film."
The Invisible Man,2020,7.1,"When Cecilia's abusive ex takes his own life and leaves her his fortune, she suspects his death was a hoax. As a series of coincidences turn lethal, Cecilia works to prove that she is being hunted by someone nobody can see.",With the pandemic I think studios released the movies they were not in love with and are still holding on to their best movies for later this year or the beginning of next year. There was an abundance to stream but The Invisible Man was one of the few movies I thought was actually good.Elisabeth Moss had an excellent performance. Really making me feel the horror of the situations she was in. The concept was nice. It was executed well with some terrifying scenes. Not just seeing the horror but making you imagine the horror. There were some by the book scenes but the creators also did create some memorable unique scenes. Worth the watch.
The Invisible Man,,7.4,"A thief and conman is given the means to become invisible, and ends up working for a government agency.","I am rarely won over so quickly as I was with I-Man. It is not only intelligent but also very entertaining. Consider Hobbes & Darien. When first we meet their characters, we think ""These guys are going to kill each other!"" by the end of the third episode you think, ""I wish I had a friendship like those guys have.""The actors work so well off of each other, you can really believe that what you're seeing is real.With the entertaining, you also get the heart-warming. Darien's struggle with the loss of his brother, for example. Check out the episodes ""Johnny Apocalypse,"" and ""Ralph,"" for some of the more touching stories.Besides the excellent writing, stellar cast (Brandy Ledford not included, though you get to like her character but never to love her as you do Hobbes or Darien), great chemistry and a generally great show, you also have the more aesthetic pleasures. You have the lovely Misses Kenney and Ledford, and the gorgeous Misters Ventresca & Ben-Victor (If you like bald men, Ben-Victor is your man!). Plus the more humorously aesthetic ""Eberts"" and ""Borden (a.k.a. ""The Fat Man"").""Definitely check this show out. It's running on syndication and every Friday at 5/4c on Sci-Fi.~J."
Hollow Man,2000,5.9,"A brilliant scientist's discovery renders him invisible, but transforms him into an omnipotent, dangerous megalomaniac.","Hollow Man is a ride, baby. It isn't scary as the ads would have you believe, but I'll be dammed if it isn't one of the most entertaining horror flicks I've seen in a while. In this age of computer generated, digital effects I have a hard time telling good special effects from bad (they all start to look the same after a while), but this one has a few of the most impressive sequences I've ever seen on film. I assume this is one of the most special effect-intensive movies ever attempted (aside form the latest Star Wars), and they do dazzle, so it's a shame the story doesn't quite measure up. It starts to get a little tired in the third act, but what the hell, I was entertained.Aside form Kevin Bacon, there were no real stand-out performances in Hollow Man. The invisibility serum seems to bring on severe emotional instability in animals, so Bacon's character decides to try it out on himself. Problem is, Kevin is already nuttier than squirrel turds so this is not the smartest of decisions, but he runs the project, so he calls the shots. Mayhem ensues. This is a really clever idea for a horror film, and the smart ways the scientists think of to detect Bacon in his invisible form never ceases to impress. It's nice to see technology has finally made it so that they can do just about anything you can think of in film.Paul Verhoeven is what makes this movie most attractive for me. I really love his go-for-broke, over the top directing style, and it's put to good use in this one especially. He took a step in the right direction by distancing himself from hack-supreme Joe Esterhaus in the entertaining but flawed Starship Troopers, and now he's back on his feet again. I can just picture him screaming like a madman on set, frothing at the mouth for ""more blood, MORE BLOOD!"". He doesn't shy away from gore, violence, sex, or anything. He just jumps right in. I like that. This movie is worth about an 8/10 stars. Worth the price of admission for the effects alone. G'night!"
Ricky Gervais: Humanity,,8.0,Live performance of British comedian Ricky Gervais filmed in London's Eventim Apollo.,"Hard hitting, definitely not PC, a welcome in the age of the snowflake. His delivery and stage presence are as good as ever flowing seamlessly and the show seems to go by in a flash. One of the best stand up performances I've seen in recent memory. Great stuff."
Scenes from a Marriage,,8.0,"Television drama miniseries which re-examines the original's iconic depiction of love, hatred, desire, monogamy, marriage and divorce through the lens of a contemporary American couple, played by Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain.","""HBO's"" latest limited original series ""Scenes From a Marriage"" which was based on a 1973 Swedish Ingmar Bergman TV miniseries is brought to light in a modern day play like form from writer and director Hagai Levi just fine as he captures the right moments and small details of a married couple to be believed perfect. As all of us can relate and know people like married couples who have lived an open marriage or had affairs, and for what ever reason after many years have just called it a wrap or divorced. And you ask what was the problem were or were not they made for one another and this series highlights those very themes.The moments and scenes take place over years and many of the episode acts are done in the comfortable couple's home. The great brilliant series stars Oscar Isaac as Jonathan a college professor who's thoughtful and serious and plus he plays second fiddle to his high tech sales executive wife Mira(the super Jessica Chastain). Starting out the married couple talk out their lives and relationship in therapy, only things get complex with a new child on the way and an affair. The emotions and love go back and forth as the series scenes turn raw it's like watching tear jerking moments of a break away couple who are having problems letting go. As a viewer you feel honesty and tender times of sorrow.I'm not married still this is enough entertaining drama for me to watch, still I guess many married couples can relate to moments like these. The episodes try to capture realism and rage at it's best and the acting chemistry is top notch with Jessica and Isaac making this a must watch as acting talents are on display tour de force! The entry and exit scenes are climatic and eye opening, overall this is one eye opening revealing adult series to be watched as it's a showcase of how to open up with pain and love."
Ricky Gervais: SuperNature,,7.6,"Follows Ricky Gervais as he gives his take on the rules of comedy, spoiling his cat and debunks the supernatural, concluding that actual nature is super enough.",Welcome back Ricky! Just what I needed a good laugh and for you to not give a crap about who you offend to entertain. Thanks for calling out all the stupidity and hypocrisy. Just what we need in today's crazy world of what we live in.7/10.
Spiral: From the Book of Saw,2021,5.2,"In this new chapter from the Book of Saw, a detective and his partner investigate grisly murders that are eerily reminiscent of the past.","I'll keep this relatively short: It's a good movie worth watching, but if you've seen five thriller/horrors in your life and pay attention to small things, it's entirely predictable 30 minutes in. The traps aren't that great despite what others say. It's a fine movie on its own, though, and probably worth watching. Just don't expect to be blown away like some of these other reviewers."
Mr. Robot,,8.5,"Elliot, a brilliant but unstable cyber-security engineer and vigilante hacker, becomes a key figure in a complex game of global chaos when he and his shadowy allies try to take down the corrupt corporation his company is paid to protect.","Reviewers say 'Mr. Robot' is acclaimed for its intricate narrative, profound character studies, and exploration of mental health, societal constructs, and hacking. The show is lauded for its realistic hacking portrayal, innovative cinematography, and standout performances by Rami Malek and Christian Slater. Critics appreciate its unique storytelling, experimental episodes, and thought-provoking contemporary issues. However, some find the pacing slow and the plot convoluted, while others value its abstract and philosophical approach."
Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,2022,6.2,"Albus Dumbledore knows that Gellert Grindelwald is moving to take control of the wizarding world. Unable to stop him alone, he asks Newt Scamander to lead an intrepid team on a dangerous mission.","Reviewers say 'Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore' offers mixed reactions. Praised for visual effects and performances, especially Mads Mikkelsen and Jude Law, it faced criticism for slow pacing, disjointed plot, and weak character development. Mikkelsen's portrayal of Grindelwald sparked debate, with some missing Johnny Depp's intensity. Continuity issues and deviations from the Harry Potter canon were noted. Despite flaws, some view it as an improvement, providing enjoyable moments within the wizarding world."
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,,8.4,It follows people on the autism spectrum as they navigate the world of dating and relationships.,"Really, really wholesome and heartwarming. Loved the aus version, and the us version is just as good! It's been a while since I've seen some good non-toxic reality tv."
Starship Troopers,1997,7.3,"Humans, in a fascist militaristic future, wage war with giant alien bugs.","If ""Starship Troopers"" isn't the most epic science-fiction movie ever made, then I don't know what is! What is that you say? ""2001: A Space Odyssey""? ""Star Wars""? Well, perhaps, but they aren't nearly as entertaining as Paul Verhoeven's extravagant, unhinged and excessively violent dystopian saga. This film is probably the most cynical, yet simultaneously the most straight-faced parody in history. Look closely at the FedNet propaganda, the Aryan lead characters and their costumes, the careless sacrificing of the Infantry forces... This futuristic battle set in 2197 is a replay of WWII, but somehow Verhoeven succeeded in making us root for the fascist party! I honestly don't think there is much to write about ""Starship Troopers"", except that it's nearly perfect and brilliant from every possible angle. After the already amazing ""Robocop"" and ""Total Recall"", Verhoeven reached the ultimate in genius Sci-Fi. It's all there: the F/X, the humor, the cast, the bloodshed, the scenery, ... The only things you have to add yourself are beer and popcorn."
The Duchess,2008,6.9,"A chronicle of the life of 18th-century aristocrat Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, who was revered for her extravagant political and personal life.",It's 1774 England. Georgiana (Keira Knightley) is arranged by her mother Lady Spencer (Charlotte Rampling) to marry the older Duke of Devonshire William Cavendish (Ralph Fiennes). She is eager for high society but finds him personally cold. He brings in a girl who is probably his bastard child. He is bitter that Georgiana delivers him a girl. She becomes a popular figure. She befriends Lady Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell) who is desperate to get back her children from her abusive husband. The Duke starts an affair with Bess in a long line of many mistresses and he is able to get her back her children. Georgiana starts her own affair with Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper).This is a solid costume drama anchored by a powerful performance from Knightley. The other cast members also deliver led by Fiennes. He is a layered villain and a real human being. Atwell is also great as her character is caught up in an impossible situation. This is a slow deliberate burn. The beauty of the costumes hide an ugliness underneath it all.
Dolittle,2020,5.6,A physician who can talk to animals embarks on an adventure to find a legendary island with a young apprentice and a crew of strange pets.,Had to write a brief review as the level of ignorance regarding RDJ's accent is astounding.As a Welshman I can say his attempt at a Welsh accent is not a bad effort at all. Like many places around the UK we have regional variaions but RDJ does a passable version of a South Wales Valleys accent and that is no mean feat.As far as the plot is concerned you have to remember this is a family film that's full of CGI animals. Was it great? Not quite - but there was enough fun to enjoy if you could get past the the initial shock that Dolittle wasn't from England.Sadly it seems this was too far out of some peoples comfort zones and because of that they missed the hidden meanings of the film which circled around friends and friendship.
Venom: Let There Be Carnage,2021,5.9,"Eddie Brock attempts to reignite his career by interviewing serial killer Cletus Kasady, who becomes the host of the symbiote Carnage and escapes prison after a failed execution.","Reviewers say 'Venom: Let There Be Carnage' offers humor and strong performances, especially from Tom Hardy, with impressive visual effects and action sequences. However, criticisms include a weak script, lack of depth, and inconsistent tone. The film's reliance on humor and underdeveloped villains are noted, alongside the PG-13 rating limiting darker themes. Despite flaws, the mid-credits scene is appreciated for future potential."
Hustlers,2019,6.3,"Inspired by the viral New York Magazine article, ""Hustlers"" follows a crew of savvy former strip-club employees who band together to turn the tables on their Wall Street clients.","""Hustlers"" (2019 release; 110 min.) is ""Inspired By a True Story"", we are reminded at the beginning. As the movie opens, it is ""2007"" and an Asian-American girl named Dorothy is getting ready for work at a strip club. Then a Latina woman named Ramona makes her grand entrance and does a spectacular pole dance as Fiona Apple's ""Criminal"" blasts from the speakers. Duly impressed, Dorothy reaches out to Ramona for some dancing tips, and the two hit it off. We then go to ""2014"" where we see Dorothy being interviewed by a journalist... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Lorene Scafaria, whose ""Seeking a Friend For the End of the World"" some years ago was one of my favorite movies of that year. Here she takes a New York magazine article and turns it into a wild, wild movie. Beware: not much is left to the imagination. The grand entrance of Jennifer Lopez in that opening scene's pole dance is nothing short of stunning. In fact, the same can be said about Lopez's overall performance, which should be Oscar nomination-worthy, and certainly is a career-best performance. Lopez turned 50 this year, and looks about 35. She takes control of the movie, and requests, makes that demands, your attention. You are more than happy to give it to her. Constance Wu, Keke Palmer, and Lili Reinhardt round out the primary performers. Check out Cardi B and Lizzo (part of the strip gang). When a movie's principal set is a strip club, you can expect a lot of fist-pumping music, and the movie more than delivers on that level. In addition to the aforementioned Fiona, there are songs from Britney Spears, Janet Jackson (""Control"", of course), Fat Joe, Queen She, 50 Cent, and many, many more.""Hustlers"" premiered a few weeks ago at the Toronto International Film Festival to immediate acclaim, and was released wide last weekend (outperforming expectations at the box office). The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati in its second weekend of release was attended very nicely (a good 30 people in a small room). If you have an interest in seeing a gritty yet funny stripper drama starring an Oscar nomination-worthy Jennifer Lopez, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
A Karant√©n Z√≥na,2022,6.0,Nightmares submerge into reality and intertwine as we follow the everyday lives of ordinary people living in a parallel reality called The Quarantine Zone during the pandemic lockdown of 2020/21.,"Karant√©nz√≥na is a 2022 Hungarian sketch-film, containing 5 short stories, all set during the lockdown of the corona pandemic - and each comes with a surreal, absurd twist, in the style of Twilight Zone.The stories are fairly diverse.We have:a long-term married couple struggling to remain sane with each other,a single mother homeschooling her daughter and taking care of her ill father,a lonely old lady whose belongings keep disappearing,a young infuencer and her ambitious boyfriend starting their new life togetherand a man choosing total isolation in the solitude of his apartment.While not every story is equally captivating, they all very well encapsulate the absurdity, the banality and the horror of the situation a lot of people were forced to in in the past few years. Also when take into consideration that the movie is a work of a few independent artists, without any big names or millions of dollars in the budget, it's all the more fascinating. The technicalities are all stellar, it all looks and sounds splendid.If you have a HBO Max, look no further and watch it! Great achievement!"
Space Jam: A New Legacy,2021,4.5,"A rogue artificial intelligence kidnaps the son of famed basketball player LeBron James, who then has to work with the Looney Tunes to win a basketball game.","Space Jam was the epitome of the 90's child life. It was corny, Michael Jordan couldn't act, but it had its charm. This movie was absolutely atrocious. LeBron is so wooden it's just obnoxious. I can honestly say this was one of the worst movies ever made out side of the way they pieced together the other Warner brothers properties. Still would never watch again."
The Dog House,,8.7,"Observational documentary set inside Wood Green animal charity in Godmanchester. Following the work of staff, who are committed to matching their homeless dogs with prospective new owners.","Me and my girls just love this show.We all just love dogs and our youngest is leaning English in the nicest of ways - It's just the lovely family time in the couch, watching this."
Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,8.2,"With Spider-Man's identity now revealed, Peter asks Doctor Strange for help. When a spell goes wrong, dangerous foes from other worlds start to appear.","Reviewers say 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' is a fan-pleasing spectacle with a stellar cast and iconic villains. Emotional depth and Peter Parker's struggles are highlighted, yet the film faces criticism for nostalgia-driven plot holes and pacing issues. Despite overstuffed storylines and underdeveloped characters, it remains an entertaining, visually impressive Marvel entry, though not without its flaws in coherent storytelling."
The Gray Man,2022,6.5,"When the CIA's most skilled operative, whose true identity is known to none, accidentally uncovers dark agency secrets, a psychopathic former colleague puts a bounty on his head, setting off a global manhunt by international assassins.","It doesn't look like a cheap movie, but no chance that this movie had over two hundred million dollars in budget. It's a decent and enjoyable movie but it shouldn't cost that much. Spend your money on better things instead of this easily consumed but entertaining film. Companies like Netflix and Disney keep producing mediocre content when they have insane budgets. Do they spend every penny on the CGI and hire children to do the writing? The writing in Gray Man is not bad, but maybe we should expect more when they have an almost unlimited budget?The action is good some of the time. The actors did a great job and it looks legit when they fight. Some action scenes use way too much greenscreen which is a shame. I thought we had learned by now after Tom Cruise's success. But of course it is much easier to do some of these sequences in the computer (and safer).There are many location titles in this movie. Probably too many, but at least it becomes clear where we are. The environments are very nice, but the absolute best thing is neither the environments nor Ana De Armas, it's Ryan Gosling. Jesus, he's in phenomenal shape. Has he put on some weight for Barbie? It's great that he's back on the big screen. WFun to see him in an action role similar to James Bond or John Wick, and he does a great job. He's charismatic, good-looking, funny and has perfect comedic timing. Without Gosling this movie would've been a 5/10.Ana De Armas is also great in the film. She has proven to be fierce in both this and James Bond. Soon we will surely see her starring in her own action film."
House of Gucci,2021,6.6,"When Patrizia Reggiani, an outsider from humble beginnings, marries into the Gucci family, her unbridled ambition begins to unravel their legacy and triggers a reckless spiral of betrayal, decadence, revenge, and ultimately...murder.","A film so out of its mind that it is operating entirely on impulses, House of Gucci makes for a wild, inconsistent & unabashedly over-the-top biographical crime drama that chronicles the downfall of the Gucci family dynasty without any intent or interest and is surprisingly fuelled by absolutely unhinged performances, each functioning on a separate wavelength and pointed in a different direction.Directed by Ridley Scott, this tonal nightmare plays out like an (un)intentional parody of the Oscar-bait biopics and is far from the quality of work we expect from the filmmaker at helm. All its elements are at odds with each other, thus resulting in a film so bonkers & unpredictable in its approach & execution that it actually piques the curiosity in a way that's not just unusual or unexpected but also nonsensical.However, a story treatment this uneven & erratic can only carry on for a while before the appeal goes away and this one goes on for 157 long minutes, all of which is tediously paced. The characters themselves are mere caricatures and the ensemble cast is given the license to render them as such. But none of the actors are ever on the same level or looking for any kind of harmony even when sharing screen together.Overall, House of Gucci is inarguably the ""so bad it's good"" film of the year. Laced with irony, drowning in decadence and incongruous in each n every aspect, this overlong & overbearing train-wreck suffers from issues of its own makings and despite boasting an A-list ensemble, it doesn't utilise a shred of their talents. Inadvertently hilarious & downright mediocre, Ridley Scott's latest is what happens when the entire cast n crew is left unsupervised & goes amok."
American Splendor,2003,7.4,An original mix of fiction and reality illuminates the life of comic book hero everyman Harvey Pekar.,"Successfully innovative, American Splendor combines fiction and reality in a spellbinding and amusing way, winning awards at Cannes and Sundance, and proving its maxim that life is pretty complex (and endlessly fascinating) stuff . . .The story features Harvey Pekar, as himself, as the played by actor Paul Giamatti and as the comic book persona that he has created based on himself. Pekar is downbeat, depressed, in a dead end filing job, rather bitter. His best friend is a self-confessed nerd. Yet when the events of his life are epitomized in comic book snapshots they are intensely poignant, they seem to reach the disenfranchised, the dysfunctional within each of us. We follow him into a marriage that is as weird as he is. The originality of the material is reflected in its postmodern style of presentation, self-awareness of audience-manipulation blending seamlessly with entertainment and artistic delivery. Scenes are introduced and blended with comic book taglines, storyboarding, and even transitions from interloping set discussions with the real Pekar to the actor playing the scene under discussion. If it sounds pretentious, it's not ¬ñ simply because it works so well and in an unpretentious way. Lovingly created and very moving. Probably the first real classic of 2003 and not to be missed, and for lovers of jazz/blues a soundtrack collectors item.(Seeing it at the Edinburgh International Film Festival I also had the privilege of seeing the real life Pekar, his wife and adopted daughter together with Paul Giamatti, truly topping off a multi-media experience haha!)"
Post Mortem,2020,5.5,A post mortem photographer and a little girl confront ghosts in a haunted village after the First World War.,"Despite the actors and the never clear plot, especially at the end where it gets lost in big confusion, the whole entertains quite well........................."
French Exit,2020,5.9,An aging Manhattan socialite existing on the last of her inheritance moves to a small Paris apartment with her son and cat.,"I don't understand the reviews that trash this movie, primarily because the complaints seem to stem from the type of movie this is and disappointment that it isn't something else.Slight, subtle, art house-type movies typically appeal to a certain kind of moviegoer so I'm confused why this movie would even be something a viewer expecting outright comedy, big plots or themes or action - some of the complaints about the film - would ever select to watch. This would never appeal to my spouse, who prefers superhero movies. I, on the other hand, personally like subtle movies about reflection of one's life and choices, and the damage or outcomes that can result from those choices...which is what I felt this movie was about.Michelle Pfeiffer and Lucas Hedges, as mother and son - as well as the rest of the supporting cast (especially Valerie Mahaffey as Madame Reynard) - were great. All around good performances with a sprinkling of humor; I didn't expect belly laughs. Michelle Pfeiffer as Frances was very effective as a woman coming to terms with the vanity, superficiality, and na√Øvet√© of her younger years and the mistakes made in her marriage, with her finances, and with her now-adult son. She presents as strong but aloof, keeping people at a distance as a means to protect herself - only to find enjoyment and a family of sorts with a full house of strangers who have assembled around her in her quest to find a cat presumed to carry the spirit of her dead husband.For sure, not a lot goes on action-wise. Just Frances loosening up emotionally enough to come to terms with her current circumstances. Slight and bittersweet, but not horrible by any means."
Father of the Bride,2022,5.9,"A father comes to grips with his daughter's upcoming wedding through the prism of multiple relationships within a big, sprawling Cuban-American family.","Take a beloved movie - force fit, gender swaps, nationality and sexuality to appear inclusive. And at the end of the day - for the political cash grab using nostalgia to gain money.Literally the Covid - short reunion clip - of the original cast as if their characters had continued was much more entertaining that this.Add this to the list:
Ocean 8
Ghostbusters 2018
Home Sweat Home Alone
Etc.Miss the days movies were made with original ideas, heart and soul."
Clifford the Big Red Dog,2021,5.9,A young girl's love for a tiny puppy named Clifford makes the dog grow to an enormous size.,"I remember the books when I was a kid of Clifford the Big Red Dog, and after all the kids books being made into films, I was not surprised that Clifford was made.My only problem with this film is Jack Whitehall, he's not terrible but moments where he tries to be funny, he isn't. Trying to be Topher Grace and Zachery Levi mixed together and it doesn't get many laughs. The effects with Clifford are very done, really has you convinced. Darby Camp is a delight here, so was John Cleese and Russell Wong. If anybody read the books, I believe you'll feel like a kid again watching this."
Three Christs,2017,6.3,"Three Christs follows Dr. Alan Stone who is treating three paranoid schizophrenic patients at the Ypsilanti State Hospital in Michigan, each of whom believed they were Jesus Christ. What transpires is both comic and deeply moving.","This is reminiscent of cuckoo's nest but more dramatic and a bit less comedic. The cast, though, is what I loved about this movie. Excellent acting!!! It's a little slow at times, but be sure to watch this to the end!"
Spiderhead,2022,5.5,"In the near future, convicts are offered the chance to volunteer as medical subjects to shorten their sentence. One such subject for a new drug capable of generating feelings of love begins questioning the reality of his emotions.","Spiderhead starts very well, with a serious tone and lots of conversation, kinda similar to Ex Machina. However, the story doesn't holds itself well and the plot gets convuluted without much of a development for the characters.Though it starts with promise, ""Spiderhead"" is heavy weighted sci-fi stuff that doesn't intrigue much with it's elements due to weak development, and leaves it's mark as a disappointment, rather than being something impressive.My Rating : 5/10."
Spinster,2019,5.9,"After her partner breaks up with her on her 39th birthday, Gaby tackles her fears of loneliness as well as preconceptions of what it means for a woman to be single.","First off, the fact this movie has a 5.1 review score is ridiculous. This film is not so much a romcom as it is a realistic portrayal of how and where women can find value in different areas of their lives in the absence of romantic relationships. If is really well acted, and Chelsea Perretti hits all the right marks."
DC League of Super-Pets,2022,7.0,"Krypto the Super-Dog and Superman are inseparable best friends, sharing the same superpowers and fighting crime side by side in Metropolis. However, Krypto must master his own powers for a rescue mission when Superman is kidnapped.","So much character development and love able story all around, such a blast for a cartoon movie! Better than a lot of DC films this deserves any hype. Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart have collaborated at least 6 times which makes sense they are perfect together. I like how Kate McKinnon was in Wonder Woman 1982 and in this she's an ultimate villain. Furry greatness for most anyone!"
El caso Figo: El fichaje del siglo,2022,7.1,This documentary spotlights one of the most contentious deals in football history and the extraordinary player at the center of the storm: Lu√≠s Figo.,"If you are a supporter of one of the 2 biggest clubs in your country (for me Feyenoord vs ajax), you feel the betrayal when a player goes to the arch-rival. This documentary gives an interesting look behind the scenes."
Hab,2020,6.1,"The love of 34-year-old Dora's life, has broken up with her-or worse: he has remarried. Her only joy, the pastry shop she owns, also appears to be lost. She makes up her mind to get both her ex-boyfriend and her pastry shop back, even if it means she has to lie. Along the way, she meets other families, as well as her ex-boyfriend's new wife. These meetings make her re...Read all","Hab (Cream) is a brilliant film with a wonderful take on romance. Director Nora Lakos has achieved an impressive challenge, re-inventing the modern romance on the screen. Supporting by a wonderful cast, this film revisits the ideas we all have on romance, tackles love but also self-love, media and representation. The execution is simply magnificient and all the elements, from the original score, to the acting, production deisgn and acting is brilliant. An absolute must watch."
Irma Vep,,6.8,"Mira is an American movie star disillusioned by her career and recent breakup, who comes to France to star as Irma Vep in a remake of the French silent film classic, ""Les Vampires.""","WARNING: This review is written by a contributor that HASN'T viewed the whole series.Films about making films tend to have the odds stacked against them. The concept, aside from being grossly over represented, is pathed with potholes - the biggest one being that all involved find the subject way more interesting than the audience.Another obvious risk is that it will be perceived as an egotistic indulgence and that the end product ends up more of a show off than a show. There will also be a perceived amount of laziness, after reviewing thousands of possible topics - the decision was; to make a show about ""themselves"". In short; the execution must be spot on for there to be any praise worthy merit.So... plenty of risk taken here - how has the end product turned out? After the first episode - rather much as feared. Despite some good acting; pretty boring and rather self-indulgent. That's not saying it's worse than a lot of other stuff out there. It is, however, a bumpy ride over the potholes - of which few have been avoided.Irma Vep has started out painfully predictable - resulting in a recommendation that may seem obvious; if you have enjoyed other films/shows along the theme of making a ditto - chances are you will enjoy this. If not - chances are that you will feel the urge to utter something along the lines of ""pretentious rubbish"".After two episodes the issues of main concern, apart from the above mentioned, has to do with rhythm and pacing - the overall impression is beginning to feel choppy and bouts of boredom are showing up. It is stil hard to look past the aspect of self-indulgence. However... intricate threads of complexity are being woven in and they may come into play at a later stage (if not it would be further added indulgence). The best advice, possibly, is avoid at this stage; to wait until the whole series has aired, and then read the reviews.Irma Vep could go in two very different directions from here: The most likely being that it is a cul-de-sac of self indulgence. But t could also ""come together"" in a way that makes the, relatively painful, first episodes pay off at a later stage.It's not a great idea to write a review after a couple of episodes and this is a first impression - if any greatness develops as the series progresses; this review will be altered or taken down.FINAL EDIT (After E3)
After three episodes the self-indulgence is on the rise - rather than the decline - and this reviewer will be checking out. The few potential interesting threads that were out there have come to nothing and the ""please give me a break"" moments are on the rise.Thanks for your attention."
The Box,2009,5.6,"With the press of a button, a wooden box bestows riches and death.","The creator of Donnie Darko brings you a twilight zone themed tale of the oddest fashion. The film centers on a middle aged young couple living paycheck to paycheck in 1976. One day a mysterious box appears with a red button. Later on that day a spooky gentleman shows up and tells them that they have the choice to press the button and receive a million dollars but someone they don't know will die. It's a disturbing and provocative question suspensefully outlined in the trailer and TV spots. But let it be known that you just don't know what your in for until you see it. At times pretentious and a bit melodramatic the film is ultimately effective because of it's good performances and intriguing subject matter. It would be unfair to ruin any of the plot twists for you but lets just say the film will deliver on the aspects you expect it to and not completely fulfill others it begins to outline. There's a lot of apparent symbolism and subtext in the film which is both interesting and annoying as it wasn't so evident in his other superior film Donnie Darko. There isn't too much more to say without ruining the film for you. it's meant to inspire lots of cafe chatter afterwards. However, i'd also like to say It's shot well and has an appropriately aged look to it and it's worth a watch. Check it out."
Walk of Shame,2014,6.0,"A reporter's dream of becoming a news anchor is compromised after a one-night stand leaves her stranded in downtown L.A. without a phone, car, ID or money - and only 8 hours to make it to the most important job interview of her life.","This movie is far from a masterpiece. It's pretty corny at times, and also has a couple of racist moments that are just glossed over. But ultimately, I enjoyed it. While some parts are hard to believe, watching the main character wind up in bizarre situations was entertaining enough. If you're looking for a chill comedy and don't have Oscar level standards, give it a shot."
King Richard,2021,7.5,A look at how tennis superstars Venus and Serena Williams became who they are after the coaching from their father Richard.,"King RichardSome elements were good but to be honest much of the movie was made with the agreement and the involvement of Richard Williams and is quite an airbrushing of the history to make him appear in a good light.Alarm bells, you have to ask yourself why does a biographical movie start with Richard Williams being 38 years of age, practically middle aged, because what went before is either irrelevant or unsavoury.The movie started with a happy couple and 5 young girls, a close loving nuclear family, both parents working hard, one a nurse the other a security guard, looking out for their children but living in a rough part of town. However this film omitted to say he already had 5 children, that he abandoned, with another women whom he was divorced from. Of the 5 girls in the family that was shown only Venus and Serena were his and why they were chosen by him as money making machines. I might add he has as least 10 biological children in total as well as the three adopted ones shown here.The movie then leaves the impression they struggled to be recognised and inferred this was racially motivated. Venus was made at 4 and half to play tennis on the public courts as part of the ""master plan"" and as early as 7 she had already been recognised and was being coached locally. You can't be overlooked as a 7 year old, this is twaddle!The movie instigation is based on this remarkable ""insight"" by Richard that he ""foretold"" the greatness of these two children, perhaps even before they were born. Hardly remarkable, in reality most parents have a master plan and his detailed history seems to have been constructed retrospectively.Will Smith and Aunjanue Ellis, who played his wife held this together with the tennis, Venus and Serena playing minor roles. The whole movie was overly earnest where was the humour in all of this, Richard constantly said ""enjoy yourself"", but no one ever seemed to!Overall, the movie is fatally flawed, it is not quite the American dream comes good, the history is distorted, the racial elements exaggerated, the fight to have their talent recognised fabricated, the back story omitted etc etc.Overall, as entertainment it's a 6 outta 10, Will Smith was very good, as a historically accurate record is a 1 outta 10 from me."
One Percent More Humid,2017,5.6,A pair of childhood friends reunite during their summer break from college and deal with a traumatizing experience from their past.,"I like it .good acting. Dramatic plot 
Really good!"
The Lake House,2006,6.8,"A lonely doctor who once occupied an unusual lakeside house begins to exchange love letters with its former resident, a frustrated architect. They must try to unravel the mystery behind their extraordinary romance before it's too late.","Suspension of disbelief is a wonderful phenomenon. It's used in many genres effectively and why not in romantic film? Although the Lakehouse mailbox took on some magical qualities, the plot still worked for me on a deeper level. It's about connecting with your true soulmate when you feel isolated. Who hasn't felt alone at a crowded party? Or who hasn't feared if they wait too long that they may never find that special someone? It's a part of the human condition this film examines. I mean, look at the architecture of the Lake House itself. It's isolated yet beautiful in a Frank Lloyd Wright kind of way.This is a character-driven story. It was fueled by the solid performances of Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. They are so natural and comfortable together on screen. It's more than just physical attraction between two people and that's why the love story works. It's real chemistry between them. I believed these two could be walking along Lakeshore Drive holding hands together.I was rooting for these two characters to get together. They are likable. They have angst in their lives. They show vulnerability. Real human feelings. They are successful in their careers but there is still that void. In my opinion, they are the right fit for each other. It's the underlying themes of this movie that give it substance not the fact that some of the plot is a bit far-fetched. Love is illogical in many ways but when you find that certain someone, it's magical.David Auburn's screenplay is first-rate. It creates the right mood. It has emotion in each scene. He makes the story palpable. This kept me interested. I wanted to know what was going to happen next. What more can you ask for in a touching love story? I enjoyed it."
Mr. Harrigan's Phone,2022,6.0,"When Mr. Harrigan dies, Craig, the teen who befriended and did odd jobs for him, puts his smart phone in his pocket before burial. When the lonely youth sends his dead friend a message, he is shocked to get a return text.","When I saw the trailer for this film, I was kind of excited since it's based on a story for Stephen King, and the premise was interesting, plus the two main lead actors (Donald Sutherland, Jaeden Martell) are definitely great.As the story progress, I kept waiting for the cool parts to start happening, but sadly they hardly ever happened, and all we saw is a big indirect advertising campaign for iphone (not that Apple needs it), but seriously the whole movie is based on the iphone.Another thing that got me confused is how the movie's genre says ""horror"" but it has no such thing, it's very misleading, it's more of a drama thriller.I loved the parts when Craig was reading to Harrigan, and how their relationship got stronger, in spite of the vast difference between them.I guess the main message the film is trying to convey is the effect of modern technology (in this case the smartphone) on our lives, and how it completely disengage us from the real world, and end up controlling us and feeding us lies. And also to be careful what we wish for.""When the gods wish to punish us, they answer our prayers"". Oscar Wilde."
Una relazione,2021,5.8,"Alice and Tommaso have been together for many years. When they invite their friends to dinner, everyone thinks they'll announce they're getting married. Instead, they are breaking up.",
The Lost City,2022,6.1,A reclusive romance novelist on a book tour with her cover model gets swept up in a kidnapping attempt that lands them both in a cutthroat jungle adventure.,"I wasn't expecting to enjoy this, but on the whole, I did, some bits of it were pretty silly, but there were some nice moments, and a few bits that had me in stitches. Some of the sweeter, romance moments were maybe a little corny, but that's what was expected I guess.Nice special effects, it looks great, I loved the locations used. You can argue it had a somewhat old fashioned, maybe old school vibe about it, but sometimes you just need a bit of silliness in your life.Nicely acted, they all did a good job, Daniel Radcliffe was good fun, always enjoy his work.It really does make the most of Channing Tatum's looks, and it does work, he is ridiculously handsome, and there are several tongue in cheek moments, he seems like a good sport.7/10."
Tell Me You Love Me,,7.2,A drama about three couples and the therapist they share.,"Some people will have heard about this show because of its controversy. I did myself. Admittedly, I was intrigued because of the promise of sexual content on TV - HBO, nonetheless. Having now seen the first episode of ""Tell Me You Love Me"", I know what the show is actually about.If you're expecting ""porn TV"", think again. Yes, the show does have several moments of sexual contact, both oral and intercourse, but when they occur it is anything but arousing - instead it's uncomfortably realistic - down to moments of climax, the show does not flinch from showing the explicit.But soon enough, if you actually watch the show, you'll realise that this isn't what the show is about. Many people will make the mistake of thinking this show is about sex, but it's about relationships, and how sex is used to shield us from the problems of our relationships.Three different couples are the focus each dealing with different problems; one tries desperately for a baby, one's physical relationship is intense but unreliable in terms of commitment, and one married couple struggles to deal with the lack of sex in their lives. Both the issues raised in the show and the dialogue are uncannily realistic, to the point that you can't help but compare the relationships in the show with your own, and this can sometimes make for uncomfortable viewing - I'd strongly advise against watching this with your partner."
How to Be Single,2016,6.1,A group of young adults navigate love and relationships in New York City.,"A mixed cast out of established actors and ""Newcomers"" aka. ""Isn't that the guy from (insert show-name here)"" loosens up the mood and gives the general idea that the movie doesn't take itself too serious. Creative details like glowing numbers on bottles and texts in the air also contribute to this.Furthermore, multiple laugh out loud-moments. Which is always a plus!Rebel Wilson is hilarious. Everybody has to agree at least on that.Surprisingly not the most stereotypical cheesy wannabe perfect life- ending. A deeper meaning in said ending compliments the movie as a whole, without coming over as forced.Of course movies like that always sort of have this fakeness about them. I mean, everybody knows that you could never be able to afford this huge apartment in NYC nor experience a love story like that. But you don't watch these films to get realistic life-reviews. You want to simply look at pretty people partying, doubting existence and having sex. In a not weird way of course. ""How to be single"" will provide you with all three, without making you gag over the silly tackiness."
Minx,,7.6,"In 1970s Los Angeles, an earnest young feminist joins forces with a low-rent publisher to create the first erotic magazine for women.",2 episodes in and I love it. Short sharp episodes and love the 70s themes. Jake Johnson is great as Doug and Joyce reminds me of a young Diane Keaton. Lots of smutty humour.
The Newsroom,,8.6,"A newsroom undergoes some changes in its workings and morals as a new team is brought in, bringing unexpected results for its existing news anchor.","Reviewers say 'The Newsroom' is acclaimed for its sharp writing, timely narrative, and compelling performances, particularly Jeff Daniels as the seasoned news anchor. Key themes include the challenges of news delivery in the digital age, journalistic integrity, and corporate influence on media. Despite praise, some criticize the show for political bias, overly didactic dialogue, and a preachy tone. The cast receives mixed reactions, with certain actors deemed over-the-top. Nonetheless, many appreciate its attempt to address real-world events and engaging storytelling."
Doll & Em,,6.6,"A sitcom in which English actress Emily Mortimer heads to Hollywood, closely followed by best friend Dolly Wells as her assistant",If you'd like a gentler version of Fleabag or I May DestroyYou.
Uncharted,2022,6.3,"Street-smart Nathan Drake is recruited by seasoned treasure hunter Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan to recover a fortune amassed by Ferdinand Magellan, and lost 500 years ago by the House of Moncada.","Reviewers say 'Uncharted' captivates with its adventurous spirit, driven by orchestral music, high-octane action, and impressive visuals. The sound design and effects heighten immersion, while the charming banter between Nathan Drake and Victor Sullivan adds humor. Despite some criticisms regarding plot predictability, the film's fast-paced narrative and dynamic character interactions keep audiences engaged, making it an entertaining ride through various exotic locales."
Triangle of Sadness,2022,7.2,A fashion model celebrity couple join an eventful cruise for the super-rich.,"This is why I used to go to theaters - to watch thought provoking entertaining movies. While there may be little to no blood - this movie is brutal. No stone is left unturned as you move through society's expectations of class, money and sexual politics. This is not light breezy fun and is sure to turn your stomach just watching it at times. This is a return to an original script not based on some comic book or sequel of some long drawn out franchise. I mean you could watch another DC/Marvel movie but is there a point to that anymore? This is in my humble opinion the best movie of 2022 (so far)."
Ghostbusters: Afterlife,2021,7.0,"When a single mom and her two kids arrive in a small town, they begin to discover their connection to the original Ghostbusters and the secret legacy their grandfather left behind.","Reviewers say 'Ghostbusters: Afterlife' is a nostalgic sequel with mixed reactions. Fans love the original cast's return and franchise homage. Critics find it derivative, lacking originality, and overly reliant on fan service. New characters receive varied responses; some praise performances, others find them unengaging. Visual and practical effects are generally lauded, though some desire more spookiness. Pacing and plot structure draw mixed feedback, with some finding it engaging and others feeling it drags or rushes. Overall, it's an enjoyable yet flawed addition."
The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley,2019,7.2,"The story of Theranos, a multi-billion dollar tech company, its founder Elizabeth Holmes, the youngest self-made female billionaire, and the massive fraud that collapsed the company.","Grateful to see this story told, but the documentary is unnecessarily long, repetitive, and overstylized to make up for it."
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,2022,6.9,"Doctor Strange teams up with a mysterious teenage girl who can travel across multiverses, to battle other-universe versions of himself which threaten to wipe out the multiverse. They seek help from the Scarlet Witch, Wong and others.","Reviewers say 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness' garners mixed reactions. Visual effects, action scenes, and performances by Benedict Cumberbatch and Elizabeth Olsen are lauded. However, the plot, dialogue, and character arcs are criticized. Some find it overly reliant on fan service and cameos. Pacing and multiverse execution receive negative feedback, though horror elements and Raimi's direction are appreciated."
Free Guy,2021,7.1,"When Guy, a bank teller, learns that he is a non-player character in a bloodthirsty, open-world video game, he goes on to become the hero of the story and takes the responsibility of saving the world.","Ryan Reynolds is guy, a NPC living in the game Free City. He met Jodie Comer's character and discovers things about his world. There's also a real life part of the film, with Joe Keery, Jodie Comer again, and Taika Watiti.These are all great names. And with amazing direction, an original idea and great execution is what makes Free Guy such an endlessly entertaining film.This is a short review because i want to let you see it yourself and be amazed by how good Free Guy actually is.Did I enjoy it? Yes. Is it a flawless masterpiece? Maybe not. Did I smile throughout the whole film just because how fun it is? Hell yeah."
The Card Counter,2021,6.2,"William Tell is an ex-military interrogator living under the radar as a low-stakes gambler. When he encounters a young man looking to commit revenge against a mutual enemy, he takes him on the casino circuit to set him on a new path.","I thought this film was going to be about a blackjack player, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was more of a Texas Hold'em experience. The film was directed by the talented Paul Schrader and stars Oscar Issac as the gambler. It also features Willem Dafoe in a cameo. The Dafoe character is very shallow, and we have no idea about how he became the person he was. However, the character exploration of William is much better. Two other characters are also featured; Tiffany Hadish as La Linda, the romantic interest for William, and. Tye Sheridan as Cirk (as in jerk). Too much Abu Gharib torture crap and not enough pyscho-poker. At times, vaguely reminiscent of Taxi Driver due to the driven personalities of the similar protagonists, but Taxi Driver far more effective. A decent take on the miserable, lonely, depressing, and meaningless existence of gamblers, and how casinos are not exciting and fun places to be; they are quite the opposite. Family is far more important."
Death on the Nile,2022,6.3,"While on vacation on the Nile, Hercule Poirot must investigate the murder of a young heiress.","I don't always agree with the professional critics, but I have to say that I do agree this adaption, is, without a doubt, the most turgid and poorly executed Christie adaption that there has been.There is over an hour of the film before the mystery even begins and that interminable hour consists of exposition that leave the characters as two dimensional as when it started. And half of the characters seem shoveled in with no purpose whatsoever. E.g. Sophie Okonedo. She is a great actress. Perhaps the best in this cast. I strongly recommend people see her Hollow Crown and Hotel Rwanda. But her character (or that of the character's niece) in Death on the Nile is what? Serves what plot purpose? (Answer: none)The actual ""solving"" of the mystery has to be the most predictable Christie adaption ever. It is a outright ""Cui bono?"" It makes it clear this is written for very low brow audience."
Dollface,,7.3,"After breaking up with her longtime boyfriend, a woman tries to reconnect with the friends she lost during the relationship.",Consider this a palate cleanser after Two Broke Girls.
Relic Hunter,,6.5,"History Professor Sydney Fox and her linguistic assistant Nigel recover ancient artifacts from around the world, while battling rival hunters.","This show finished on the week before I graduated from high school in 2002, after knowing about it, I decided to watch this show that my high school teacher recommanded. Relic Hunter is about a woman name Sydney Fox(Tia Carrera) that is like Lara Croft and Indiana Jones combined, as she goes out with her associates to find old ancient relics that other people and historians want. This is fun at its best, and what I like about this show is that it gets it right for being a Tomb Raider wannabe. And the idea that Sydney never uses a gun.Thanks Mr. MacAulay"
Cruella,2021,7.3,"During the 1970s London punk rock revolution, young grifter Estella transforms herself into the raucous, revenge-bent Cruella de Vil.","Okay so cruella was actually kind of amazing. The cinematography and costuming were breathtakingly beautiful. The storyline took a few weird turns, but for the most part really worked. The characters were well cast and well acted. The Emma's slayed being maniacally deranged."
Jungle Cruise,2021,6.6,Based on Disneyland's theme park ride where a small riverboat takes a group of travelers through a jungle filled with dangerous animals and reptiles but with a supernatural element.,"Was going to give it a 5 if not for the talented Emily Blunt who always makes things better. As always chemistry is on point with whatever actor she teams up with and Johnson is no exception. It is mostly fun but the story is iffy and yes there is memories of Pirates and The Mummy all throughout. The rating here on IMDb is pretty much spot on, audience on RT has inflated it to over 90 which it is not. Just have fun with it. I feel like the sequel which they have announced will be just a money grab. I won't be in a rush to see it."
Black Widow,2021,6.6,Natasha Romanoff confronts the darker parts of her ledger when a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past arises.,"Reviewers say 'Black Widow' garners mixed reactions, highlighting strong performances by Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh, and impressive action scenes. Themes of feminism and Natasha Romanoff's backstory are well-received. However, pacing issues, a generic plot, and the portrayal of Taskmaster draw criticism. Some find the film entertaining yet formulaic, while others believe it doesn't meet Marvel's usual standards. The MCU timeline placement and connections to past events also receive varied feedback."
Skyscraper,2018,5.8,"A security expert must infiltrate a burning skyscraper, 225 stories above ground, when his family is trapped inside by criminals.","I'm going to start by saying it was a good idea about the skyscraper, how the producers do the design of it... But we have to be serious in some of the scene ... how can he jump from the crane to the building and then in other scen he can't jump like 7ft 
The little boy almost doesn't appear in all the movie... He says like 10 lines and that's it
In the first scenes they try to make real the fact of breath the smoke in putting the wet towels but in the last part after being like 4 hours in that building they look like they're breathing pure oxygen like they were in a forest"
Thor: Love and Thunder,2022,6.1,"Thor enlists the help of Valkyrie, Korg and ex-girlfriend Jane Foster to fight Gorr the God Butcher, who intends to make the gods extinct.","Reviewers say 'Thor: Love and Thunder' is lauded for its humor, action, and Christian Bale's performance. Criticisms include over-the-top comedy, inconsistent tone, and underutilized characters. The film continues 'Thor: Ragnarok's' style but struggles with balancing humor and serious themes. Visuals and lead chemistry are appreciated, yet some find the plot rushed and humor excessive. Jane Foster's introduction as Mighty Thor is generally well-received, though her arc feels underdeveloped. The film is entertaining but less impactful than previous Thor movies."
Eternals,2021,6.2,"The saga of the Eternals, a race of immortal beings who lived on Earth and shaped its history and civilizations.","Reviewers say 'Eternals' is visually stunning with impressive effects and a diverse cast delivering compelling performances. However, the film faces criticism for its cluttered story, underdeveloped characters, and erratic pacing. Some feel it struggles to balance ambitious themes and new characters. Action sequences, though visually impressive, are less engaging than other Marvel films. Despite issues, many appreciate its attempt to explore new narrative territories within the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
Loki,,8.2,The mercurial villain Loki resumes his role as the God of Mischief in a new series that takes place after the events of ‚ÄúAvengers: Endgame.‚Äù,"Reviewers say 'Loki' is acclaimed for its intricate narrative, character depth, and Tom Hiddleston's performance. The series excels in merging time travel, mythology, and sci-fi, with standout visual effects and a strong score. The Loki-Mobius dynamic is celebrated for its humor and chemistry. However, some critique pacing, character arcs, and Loki's villainous portrayal. Overall, 'Loki' is seen as a valuable and entertaining Marvel addition."
Disenchanted,2022,5.6,"Fifteen years after her happily ever after, Giselle questions her happiness, inadvertently turning the lives of those in the real world and Andalasia upside down in the process.","My main issue with the film is it could've been better, there were some interesting ideas presented rather than just rehashing the original in a dulled down way as most sequels do, the cast were great although writing-wise the character development from the first film had basically vanished and the new characters were somewhat forgettable, still some funny moments but not as memorable as the original, similarly the songs were not as memorable as the original either, lots of abandoned plot threads and characters that had no role in the story but were just kind of there, it feels unfair to compare this to the original since that was over 14 years ago, time flies, but I just think there wasn't really a reason to make a sequel to the first EnchantedEven so, as far as sequels go it's not the worst, the aforementioned positives stood out for me, the sets were beautiful and costume design was excellent, and I liked some of the ideas the sequel was leading into but the execution just fell flat for me, felt very rushed, sense of scale gone, the animated sequences were almost unnecessary this time as they didn't even involve much movement or expression, and it's a scathing indictment of both Disney's gradual attempts to abandon animation as a medium (despite it being so crucial to their past success) and the conditions animators have to work under, with very little pay or suitable hours, especially compared with the animated sequences of the first film.All in all it ironically kinda lives up to the Disney tradition of making a memorable, iconic blockbuster film about a princess and then having the direct-to-video sequel being kind of underwhelming, I'd rate this a 6 or a 5 under other circumstances but because I feel like it was close to being a better film and just didn't reach that, and because it doesn't live up to the original, I think 4 is kind of appropriate, Disney needs to pick up their slack, they're becoming too complacent."
What If...?,,7.3,"Exploring pivotal moments from the Marvel Cinematic Universe and turning them on their head, leading the audience into uncharted territory.","Reviewers say 'What If?' offers fresh takes on Marvel characters with praised animation and voice acting. However, the series garners mixed reviews; some episodes are celebrated for creativity and emotional impact, while others are criticized for being rushed, inconsistent, or shallow. Common complaints include uneven quality and underdeveloped plots. Despite these flaws, many appreciate its innovative concept and potential for new MCU narratives."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,2019,6.4,The surviving Resistance faces the First Order once again.,"Reviewers say 'Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker' garners mixed reactions, with praise for its nostalgic elements, special effects, and emotional moments. However, it faces criticism for incoherent storytelling, inconsistent character development, and over-reliance on fan service. Some argue it doesn't match the original trilogy's legacy, while others see it as a flawed yet fitting conclusion to the Skywalker saga. The film's handling of established lore and its attempts to reconcile the sequel trilogy are contentious points."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,,7.7,"Four 18-year-old freshman roommates at Essex College in Vermont. A bundle of contradictions and hormones, these sexually active college girls are equal parts lovable and infuriating.","I wasn't sure at first if I was going to like this, but then I was hooked by episode 4!! Loved the character development and where the story is headed. Hopefully will get picked up for a season 2!"
WandaVision,,7.9,"Blends the style of classic sitcoms with the MCU, in which Wanda Maximoff and Vision - two super-powered beings living their ideal suburban lives - begin to suspect that everything is not as it seems.","Reviewers say 'WandaVision' is lauded for its innovative fusion of classic sitcom elements and MCU lore, featuring strong performances by Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany. The show's deep dive into grief and trauma, alongside its genre-bending narrative, garners acclaim. However, some criticize its slow pacing, inconsistent tone, and sitcom format, which feels gimmicky. The ambitious storytelling occasionally outpaces execution, resulting in a disjointed experience and underutilized supporting cast. Despite mixed opinions, 'WandaVision' is widely seen as a daring and experimental MCU entry."
The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special,,6.9,"Star-Lord, Drax, Rocket, Mantis, and Groot engage in some spirited shenanigans in an all-new original special created for Disney+.","Reviewers say 'The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special' offers humor, heartwarming moments, and beloved characters, with fans praising Drax and Mantis's comedic dynamic and festive atmosphere. However, some critics deem the plot simplistic and the special shallow. Musical numbers elicit mixed reactions, and visual effects, especially Groot's appearance, spark debate. It's considered a fun, though non-essential, Marvel Cinematic Universe addition."
At Middleton,2013,6.5,Two parents fall in love over the course of a single day while playing hooky from their children's college tour.,"""By the time the afternoon bell rings you will have fallen in love. I guarantee it."" George Hartman (Garcia) and his son arrive at Middleton College for a tour. While there he meets Edith Martin (Farmiga) who is doing the same with her daughter. The two begin talking and soon strike up a fast friendship that over the course of the day evolves into something that makes them question everything. I'll start by saying I wasn't really excited about watching this. I expected a basic love story with out much substance. What I did find was I liked it much more then I expected. While the movie is really nothing more then two people talking for an hour and a half it was actually entertaining to watch. The best way to really describe what happens in this is to compare it to the Before Sunrise trilogy. This has the same feel. Two people meet and we watch their relationship grow over a few hours. The most entertaining aspect of the movie is watching how the roles of the children and parents switch. The parents have the college experiences and the kids stress about everything else. Overall, if you liked the Before Sunrise movies then you will like this as well. Better then I expected, it was very romantic and a very real love story. I give this a B+."
Spider-Man: Een nieuw universum,2018,8.4,Teen Miles Morales becomes the Spider-Man of his universe and must join with five spider-powered individuals from other dimensions to stop a threat for all realities.,"Reviewers say 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is acclaimed for its innovative animation and unique visual effects. The exploration of the multiverse and diverse Spider-Man characters is praised for originality. Character development, especially Miles Morales and Peter Parker, adds depth. However, some criticize pacing, plot inconsistencies, and over-reliance on visuals. Political and social themes receive mixed feedback. Voice acting and soundtrack are divisive, with some appreciating performances and others finding them lacking."
Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,2016,5.8,Five sisters in 19th century England must cope with the pressures to marry while protecting themselves from a growing population of zombies.,"Well, first time for accident I saw the trailer I was shocked, I used to really love Jane Austen's adaptation movies, because love her work. But this was different and trailer was kind of too much for me.Nevertheless, I felt curiosity about it. And then I saw it. I must confess that I had seen ""Pride and Prejudice""'s Joe Wright (2005) like thousands of times and zombies don't bother me so why not? well the movie was just Lovely! Seen this girls as a powerful warriors, seen our beloved Lizzie fight it against zombies without fear, with grace and elegance was great! There are some things make me doubt but is refreshing, have some action, some brains and of course Mr. Darcy the personification of charming prince doesn't disappoint is sexy in his own way.The landscapes are beautiful, some great actors around and zombies are OK. It's not the movie that will change your life but if you are a big fan you're going to smile you'll thrill every time Mr. Darcy and Lizzie's eyes meet and with every interaction. it doesn't matter if are zombies, plants, aliens or whatever. This is one of the biggest love stories of all times."
Black Adam,2022,6.2,"Nearly 5,000 years after he was bestowed with the almighty powers of the Egyptian gods--and imprisoned just as quickly--Black Adam is freed from his earthly tomb, ready to unleash his unique form of justice on the modern world.","Reviewers say 'Black Adam' features strong action sequences, special effects, and a fun introduction of the Justice Society. Critics note the generic plot, lack of character development, and over-reliance on CGI. Positive reviews commend entertaining moments, humor, and DCEU revitalization potential. Negative reviews criticize pacing, dialogue, and superficial theme treatment. The film is seen as an average superhero entry, with some praising its differentiation from Marvel films."
Down with Love,2003,6.3,"In 1962 New York City, love blossoms between a playboy journalist and a feminist advice author.","Barbara (Renee Zellweger) has just written a book called Down With Love. She leaves Maine and lands in New York City, where her book is about to hit the shelves. Unfortunately, the male executives at her publishing house have doubts about the new tome and are not forking over any marketing money. The lone woman at Banner publishing, Vicki, takes Barbara under her wing and they work to get the nonfiction title some fame. First, they decide to ask Catcher Block (Ewan McGregor), a prominent male writer for Know magazine, to do a cover story for the book. He postpones the interview again and again. In the meantime, Vicki and Barbara get the book mentioned on the Ed Sullivan show. Soon, copies of DWL are flying out of the bookstores, mainly because the book empowers women to think more about themselves and less about attracting a man. Catcher spies a picture of Barbara in a bookstore window and knows he has to meet her. However, since he is a notorious ladies man, he assumes the identity of an astronaut named Zip Martin. Naturally, he plays the perfect gentleman when he begins to take Barbara out on the town. How long will it be until Barbara discovers the truth? And, will she have fallen for the guy first? Romantic comedy fans everywhere should love this film. It is a takeoff of the old Doris and Rock movies that are so delightfully fun and full of clean mischief. Zellweger and McGregor are a joy in their roles as the smitten couple. The rest of the cast, including a cameo by Tony Randall, are great, too. The look of the film is nice, as are the costumes and the Big Apple setting. If you love crazy, contrived, comic love tales, get this one tonight. You will bask in its take-me-out-of-my-blues delivery."
Emma,1996,6.6,"While matchmaking for friends and neighbours, a young 19th Century Englishwoman nearly misses her own chance at love.","Emma (1996)I like Gwyneth Paltrow, and I love Jane Austen. (That sounds bad. Sorry Gwyneth.)And this is a great movie for its writing, and a stiff and imperfect movie for its acting. And for Austen fans (and fans is an understatement for some of them) this is almost awful movie. Awful if you love sublime writing and can't stand to see it so wooden.Paltrow is good. She's pretty. She's appropriately upright. But she insists on ""delivering"" her lines. She has them memorized, yes. But she doesn't inhabit the character. And Emma, the character, is one of the best of all literature, filled with sassy individualism and social blindness due to ordinary teenage arrogance. The material is there, and it's a great story (if you like early 19th Century melodramas bordering on soap opera of the highest level).So, it's not a terrible presentation of the movie, but it is, to be sure, a presentation. I honestly think (and don't tremble in rage here) that Alisha Silverstone in ""Clueless"" gets the spirit of Emma much closer. There is of course a gap of sensibilities here that I'm ignoring‚Äîa girl in 1995 (Silverstone) is no match for a girl in Austen's time. I'll leave that one vague.About ""Emma"" it's worth saying that the sets and costumes are so convincing you don't really think about them. Everything is brightly lit (which I suppose is a reasonable choice, though it flattens the film emotionally as opposed to, say, the Merchant-Ivory approach). The whole spectacle is spread before the camera lovingly, if a bit predictably.In the end it's Austen who wins. The writing, both in the specific dialog and in the general plot outline, are delicate and witty and insightful. Nothing sensational here, just drawing room observation at its best. Kudos for that much, and a reasonable translation to film. It's Austen who wins all those stars."
My Salinger Year,2020,6.5,"A college grad takes a clerical job working for the literary agent of the renowned, reclusive writer J.D. Salinger.","This film starts off a bit slow and hard to follow until you start to feel you are back in that time of your life when you had your first notable job. The story unfolds and you start to care about the depth of the cast. The music accompanies the scenes nicely. The images of New York are always appreciated by me. This is a gentle movie for those who appreciate writers, books and agents."
Sex Education,,8.2,A teenage boy with a sex-therapist mother teams up with a high-school classmate to set up an underground sex-therapy clinic at school.,"Reviewers say 'Sex Education' is lauded for its authentic portrayal of teenage experiences, addressing themes like sexuality and self-discovery. The show is celebrated for its empathetic handling of LGBTQ+ issues and emphasis on communication. However, Season 4 faces criticism for an overcrowded cast, underdeveloped storylines, and a shift towards drama. Despite this, earlier seasons are praised for their wit and meaningful exploration of teenage challenges."
A Hollywood Christmas,,5.2,A successful Christmas movie director begins living her own Christmas movie when a handsome network exec shows up threatening to halt production on her latest film.,"This movie is awful! The actors are terrible. I'm looking forward to Hollywood getting their act together ... there needs to be better writing at least. And less annoying characters and less corny acting and noises, the squeaky sidekick was the most annoying a awful character but they were all pretty bad. It felt like a hallmark lifetime corny movie. Why would you think this is good enough for the big screen!!?? Cmon, where are the next Scorsese!? I don't see any around in this generation. So sad. These people need to go back to school. I'm very disappointed at this movie and the time I took to watch it, be warned it was not good."
Morbius,2022,5.1,"Biochemist Michael Morbius tries to cure himself of a rare blood disease, but he inadvertently infects himself with a form of vampirism instead.","Reviewers say 'Morbius' has been met with mixed reactions, highlighting both its flaws and merits. Critics point to a weak script, poor character development, and underwhelming performances, especially Jared Leto's lead role. The film is faulted for its pacing issues, plot inconsistencies, and subpar special effects. Some argue its PG-13 rating limits darker genre exploration. Conversely, a few reviewers appreciate its entertaining moments, solid CGI, and potential within the Marvel universe."
The Nanny Diaries,2007,6.2,"A college graduate goes to work as a nanny for a rich New York family. Ensconced in their home, she has to juggle their dysfunction, a new romance, and the spoiled brat in her charge.","When this movie was unceremoniously yanked back in April 2007, right before its initially scheduled release, I thought it must be pretty bad. I had enjoyed the book, and so was already disappointed. But I decided to see it anyway, just out of curiosity. At first, I found myself finding fault...like when the preschool doors just open up and small children pour out of it onto the street. Like that's going to happen in an urban area ANYWHERE in this country what with all the fear of kidnapping we have these days. That and a few other little niggly details bothered me at first, but as the movie went on, I found myself caring about the characters; enjoying the story. It's not like the book, but that's probably good. I don't think the book is written in a way that would translate well to the big screen. The ending was a bit happier than the book, but in this kind of movie, the happy ending was welcome. I found myself enjoying this movie in spite of my own predisposition to be underwhelmed by it. It's not going to win any Oscars or anything, but I thought it a find effort for all involved, particularly Laura Linney, Paul Giamatti, and Scarlet Johansen!"
The Road,2009,7.2,"In a dangerous post-apocalyptic world, an ailing father defends his son as they slowly travel to the sea.","By Zach Copeland ""The Road"" Takes Fresh Approach to Post-Apocalyptic Genre Ever since God flooded out the entire human race in the early pages of Genesis, literature has abounded with stories of the apocalypse. For generation after generation, from The Book of Revelations to The Stand, we have obsessed over the end of the world, how it will come to pass, and what, if anything, we can do to stop it. Now that humankind has reached a point where the End could conceivably happen in an afternoon, our glimpses into this theoretical future are all the more intriguing. And they've never been more important.The Road, directed by John Hillcoat (The Proposition) and based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy (No Country For Old Men), is a dark, poignant story of a father and son journeying through a post-apocalyptic wasteland, withstanding harsh weather, malnutrition, and under the constant threat of marauders, thieves and cannibals. Their goal is simple: to carry on.Those looking to sink their teeth into mindless disaster-porn (not that there's anything wrong with that) can get their fix elsewhere. The Road is a smaller, more penetrating film that draws strength from its intimacy and its ability to do so much with so little.Viggo Mortensen gives an emotional tour de force as the embattled father; look for him on the red carpet come March. Watching children act is oftentimes painful for me, but I thought Kodi Smit-McPhee was impressive and genuine as the son, and takes on the task of being in literally every scene with rare fearlessness. Charlize Theron, Robert Duvall, and Guy Pearce give small but highly memorable performances, Duvall in particular, whose portrayal of a withered old man journeying all alone will haunt you.The desolate environment in which the story takes place is itself a character, foreign yet eerily familiar, and so perfectly conceptualized that it matches ‚Äì heck, surpasses the standard of realism set by films such as 28 Days Later and Children of Men. Shot throughout four states, including at the site of the Mount St. Helens eruption, Hillcoat and cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe (The Others, The Sea Inside) paint a backdrop that is altogether beautiful and devastating.They say that every generation since the dawn of man has feared the End, and while this may be true, not every generation has seen what our modern technology is capable of. The Road is a dark looking glass into our future, and what it is likely to become if our primal nature is left unchecked.Early in the film, the son looks at his father and asks him, ""We're the good guys, right?"" The father's response is in the affirmative, but as their situation become increasingly desperate, that sense of morality we think to be ingrained is put to the test. Hillcoat does a masterful job of portraying human beings as what we are and always have been. He holds up a mirror to the world and hypnotizes you with it.As far as post-apocalyptic movies go, The Road is hands-down one of the best ever made. Despite its raw, gritty facade, which will understandably be a turn-off for many theatergoers, the story underneath has a sense of serenity that everyone can relate to.The Road opens everywhere on November 25.

FOMO: Fear of Missing Out,2019,6.6,"Gerg√∂ and his teenage friends are into three things: partying, sex, and their online following. One night, at a party, Lilla falls victim to the boys. A dare gets out of hand and the youngsters' world changes forever overnight.","A story about cruelty, showmanship, huge mistakes, profound cowardice of teens. A party, a provocation from friends, a rape. And the consequences. The realism of situation, the good acting of young actors, the poetic end are basic virtues of this cold and precise portrait of an age and society, in fair way."
North by Northwest,1959,8.3,"A New York City advertising executive goes on the run after being mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies, and falls for a woman whose loyalties he begins to doubt.","Reviewers say 'North by Northwest' is acclaimed for its suspenseful, comedic, and romantic elements, highlighting Alfred Hitchcock's directorial prowess. Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint deliver standout performances, while the screenplay's wit and twists captivate audiences. Iconic scenes, Bernard Herrmann's score, and Robert Burks' cinematography are lauded. Despite minor critiques on plot and character depth, it remains a timeless classic."
Here Are the Young Men,2020,4.7,"Dublin teenagers Matthew, nihilistic Rez, and the deranged Kearney, leave school to a social vacuum of drinking and drugs, falling into shocking acts of transgression.","Engaging story about the dark decent of a group of boys. Some very solid acting from the main cast, especially from Dean-Charles Chapman. You really did believe his character was going through the crisis in the movie. Unlike many other reviewers, I actually enjoyed the absurd meta dream sequences. They were an interesting way to present the themes and troubles of the young men, adding a black humor element. The film was shot was like a music video, with a lot of beautiful effects and vibrant colors contrasting the dark content of violence, vandalism, drug binging, suicide, rape and even murder. Unfortunately, it lacks some more substance into why one of the main characters does what they do. Needed more background and exploration on downward spiral of mental illness and motivation. The film's message gets even more lost towards the last act. Although the story ending was somewhat satisfying, it still left a bad taste. But you definitely can't hate on Chapman for trying to sell the story, fantastic acting. Still worth watching."
Parks and Recreation,,8.6,The absurd antics of an Indiana town's public officials as they pursue sundry projects to make their city a better place.,"Reviewers say 'Parks and Recreation' is celebrated for its humor, heartwarming moments, and political satire. The show features well-developed characters like Leslie Knope, Ron Swanson, and April Ludgate. The ensemble cast's chemistry and character growth are highlighted. It balances comedy with meaningful storytelling, addressing real-life issues and promoting community engagement. Despite some criticisms about certain characters and comparisons to 'The Office,' it is praised for its memorable catchphrases, iconic characters, and positivity. The mockumentary style and character evolution are noted strengths."
100 Foot Wave,,8.1,"The globe-trotting adventures of big wave surfer Garrett McNamara, his family, and fellow surfers.","Rarely does television bring me to tears. This series has done so several times. Tears of joy, defeat, agony, and fear. I have long wanted to FEEL what it is like to big wave surf - the power, speed, exhilaration, physicality, and fright. I finely have an inkling, due to the superb cinematography, deft editing and sound design, and sublime Philip Glass score. Glass' music raises this documentary filmmaking from excellent to extraordinary.I usually watch movies and television with calm attention. Throughout '100 Foot Wave,' however, I often found myself cheering, clapping, and gasping at the screen.Bravo!"
France,2021,5.9,"A celebrity journalist, juggling her busy career and personal life, has her life over-turned by a freak car accident.","No plot, attempts at a storyline. Completely all over the place. What a waste of hours! Neither the main plot nor the plot adds up to anything. Love affair seems cringy. Husband-wife and even the filial relationship seems so fake. One story moves onto another with no relation in between as if this were the attempt of a photographer to bring together a scrapbook of images. And to be honest, even the images are not that great. So, don't waste your time."
And Just Like That...,,5.6,"The series follows Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte as they navigate the journey from the complicated reality of life and friendship in their 30s to the even more complicated reality of life and friendship in their 50s.","It felt pretty nostalgic watching this and I don't think the writing is as bad as people are saying.However, what ruined the show for me was the ""wokeness"" that just felt so forced and made me cringe. I think representation in film is important, but this is just over-the-top with too much focus on gender / racism / identity / discrimination. Doesn't feel natural. And that Che Diaz character who is supposed to add a humorous touch to the show is just so unfunny I almost couldn't handle it."
Celeste & Jesse Forever,2012,6.6,A divorcing couple tries to maintain their friendship while they both pursue other people.,"¬®At last love wins. You guys are lucky to be best friends.¬®Celeste and Jesse Forever is an authentic romantic comedy directed by Lee Toland Krieger (winner of the Independent Spirit Award in 2010 for the screenplay of The Vicious Kind) and written by first timers Rashida Jones and Will McCormack. They are mostly known for their acting abilities, but they did receive an Independent Spirit nomination for their collaboration in this screenplay. Rashida Jones also stars in this film and McCormack has a supporting role as well. The story feels real and authentic and despite the fact that it stars Andy Samberg this is not as much as a comedy as it is a romantic drama. This is a very different role than what Samberg has us used to and he gives a very convincing performance alongside Rashida Jones who really delivers here. This may be her best performance to date. What I enjoyed most about their characters is that they were deeply flawed and vulnerable towards each other, but despite that they still managed to be really likable. I thought it was a very honest portrayal about two best friends who fall in love with each other at a very young age and have problems making the transition to adulthood together. In a way this is a very different romantic comedy since it begins sort of upside down with the romantic montage at the beginning of the movie and the disintegration of their relationship from then on. I really was surprised with the opening of the film since I really didn't know what this movie was about. The movie transitions nicely from being serious at times to being more playful at others, but it's all handled in a very authentic and believable way.The movie begins with a romantic montage between Jesse (Andy Sandberg) and Celeste (Rashida Jones), two best friends in love with each other with a nice indie soundtrack in the background. When the story begins we are surprised to discover that the two friends aren't actually in a relationship anymore, since they have been separated for 6 months and are planning on getting divorced after six years of marriage. You wouldn't know that if you were an outsider because the couple seems to get along with each other perfectly. Jesse and Celeste remain close friends and spend almost all day talking to each other. Jesse also happens to be living in Celeste's guest house as he is currently unemployed and seems to be a bit of a slacker. Celeste on the other hand is a successful trend forecaster who has recently written a book on the matter. It seems that the main issue between them during their marriage was that Jesse was a little too childish and irresponsible. Anyway, they seem to get along better now as friends. They spend a lot of time with their friends, Beth (Ari Graynor) and Tucker (Eric Christian Olsen) who are engaged, and think that the two should work out their issues. Celeste is currently working for an important client, a pop artist sensation named Riley (Emma Roberts), along with her partner Scott (Elijah Wood). Their friendship is put to the test when Jesse begins dating another woman and Celeste struggles to let go of feelings she thought weren't there anymore.I really enjoyed this film because it tackled the issues of best friends and breakup in a very authentic and real way. Rashida Jones gives a strong performance although she did go a little over the top with her reaction over Jesse dating someone else. She plays this character that thinks is so successful and smarter than everyone else. That is basically what hurt her relationship with Jesse since she considers him a slacker who seems to be heading nowhere with his life. She feels like Jesse is too immature for her, but at the same time that is what she loves about him because when the two are together they do a lot of childish things together. Their relationship is complicated, and the film depicts it in a very authentic way. This is an enjoyable indie romantic drama that is definitely worth your time. Rashida Jones should get some stronger roles offered her way because she's a talented actress and proved here that she can carry a movie. This is a strong emotional film that will leave you with a smile on your face and at the same time a sense of nostalgia. I agree with Mary Pols from TIME magazine where she said ¬®I'd rather watch five divorce movies like this than one more featuring Katherine Heigl getting married.¬® Break up can be really hard and this movie shows it in an authentic way.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
Little Women,2019,7.8,"In 19th century Massachusetts, the March sisters--Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy--on the threshold of womanhood, go through many ups and downs in life and endeavor to make important decisions about their futures.","This was very good. By all means a well made, well written and shot adaptation. But for me it didn't even come close to the '94 version with Winona Ryder. Each character was phenomenal in that old version, especially Claire Danes as Beth and Christian Bale as Laurie. Also the unforgettable Winona Ryder, of course, and Susan Sarandon. Kirsten Dunst as Amy...oh my goodness, absolutely exquisite.
Even though I enjoyed watching the new version, my preference remains firmly with the old. Though more simply told, perhaps, without flashbacks back and forth and fancy effects, to me it was richer in emotions and with much more memorable, more 'colorful' characters.
I enjoyed watching Amy in the new version, I just didn't understand why she was never little?... She was this mature woman both as a kid and an adult...very strange.
Anyway, you won't regret watching this, for sure. I just doubt I'll ever see it again. Whereas the '94 version I could watch another ten times, with pleasure. I guess that says it all."
Drive My Car,2021,7.5,A renowned stage actor and director learns to cope with a big personal loss when he receives an offer to direct a production of Uncle Vanya in Hiroshima.,"A story about love, loss, grief, trauma, acceptance & healing that's rendered on screen with the care, attention & understanding it deserves, Drive My Car makes its 3-hour runtime feel insignificant by narrating a thoroughly engrossing drama that could only work if it is allowed to unravel at its own pace and makes for an emotionally crippling journey that benefits from sincere inputs from its cast.Co-written & directed by Ryusuke Hamaguchi, the opening credits surface around the 40th minute mark coz that's when the main story actually begins but what its extended prologue does in the meantime is it silently acquaints us with our protagonist's emotional state, inner turmoil & abounding emptiness within, which in effect allows us to sympathise with him & his actions on a much deeper & more intimate level.What's impressive about Hamaguchi's storytelling is that he gives ample breathing room to his characters and allows them to express themselves at their own comfort. Also, he makes those moments earned through the quiet spaces in between. The story shifts gear once the stage director & the young chauffeur assigned to him start interacting about their past lives and the nuanced tone of their performances makes it even more immersive.Overall, Drive My Car never hurries through any of its motions and requires patience on the viewers' part but it is worth the effort, for the end result is rewarding & stimulating on more levels than one. Anchored by Hamaguchi's steady direction and strengthened by authentic work from its cast, this Japanese road drama isn't for all but for those who can relate to its emotional journey, the film will prove to be a profoundly personal & therapeutic experience."
Jackass Forever,2022,6.8,"After 11 years, the Jackass crew is back for another crusade.","Out of all the Jackass movies, this is definitely the worst. It felt like they needed a quick pay check and decided to recycle their classic stunts to make some easy cash. Some of it was funny but nothing we haven't seen before. 5 stars."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,,8.3,"The professional and personal lives of the 1980s Los Angeles Lakers, one of sports' most revered and dominant dynasties - a team that defined an era, both on and off the court.","The decision to cancel the show is still mindbogglng to me. I thought they received positive reviews from critics and fans.Anyway, I really enjoyed the show. I might be biased as I'm a big Lakers' fan. But I think the combinaton of well established stars (Reilly, Brody, Clarke) and the least known ones did work. I really like Quincy Isaiah acting as Magic, it's perfect. The different pace between first and second season might be confusing but it's not a major flaw. The cinematography is also very good and it fits the narrative of the show. It's Lakers, 1980's Lakers, the showtime.Again, I'm still annoyed with the show cancellation. I thought there could be more saucy stories or plots to be developed in the following seasons."
They Came Together,2014,5.6,"Molly owns a quaint little sweet shop. Joel works for a gigantic candy company threatening to shut her down. How they meet, fall in love, break up and get back together is hilariously recounted in this rom-com spoof.","A small business owner (Amy Poehler) is about to lose her shop to a major corporate development.This film seems to get a bad rap, with people saying it is not a good satire or parody. I respectfully, and strongly, disagree. So many movie conventions are turned on their head. Obviously, the traditional romantic comedy blueprint, but even more than that. And some moments had me laughing out loud (literally).Although ""Wet Hot American Summer"" is considered a modern classic by some, I think ""They Came Together"" is the superior film. It's more mature, more consistent. Maybe it will take a few years, but I see this becoming a cult film."
Licorice Pizza,2021,7.1,"A young man and a young woman grow up, run around, and fall in love in the San Fernando Valley, 1973.","I love this movie but can't explain why, left the cinema same way I felt after watching ""Once Upon A Time In Hollywood"". Don't really know what to say apart from I enjoyed it. Was it the era it's based in, was it the chemistry the characters shared, was it the way it was filmed, the dialogues, or was it the idyll charm Alana and Gary created? I don't know. It felt like the writers just started writing with no actual plot line, let the story flow and develop on it's own, because I can tell you what happened in the movie but don't really know what the movie's about yet it was still perfect the way it was. Felt like just watching life unfold for the characters. It wasn't complicated, at no point do you feel the script was altered to make it more witty, funny or dramatic, everything was just natural. I think more movies like this should be made. I wasn't around in the 70's, but movies like this make it feel like I'm right there with them; nostalgia to a time I never knew. Come to think of it, maybe that's why I do love it."
Jurassic World: Dominion,2022,5.6,"Four years after the destruction of Isla Nublar, Biosyn operatives attempt to track down Maisie Lockwood, while Dr Ellie Sattler investigates a genetically engineered swarm of giant insects.","Reviewers say 'Jurassic World: Dominion' offers a nostalgic reunion and impressive CGI, but suffers from a weak storyline and over-reliance on nostalgia. The convoluted plot, inconsistent pacing, and underdeveloped characters are criticized. Despite enjoyable action sequences, many find it fails to match the original 'Jurassic Park'. The blend of old and new elements is both praised and faulted, making it a decent yet flawed franchise conclusion."
The Mighty Ducks,1992,6.6,A self-centered Minnesota lawyer is sentenced to community service coaching a rag tag youth hockey team.,"The Mighty Ducks (aka as the Champions), is one of the great Disney movies I have seen. Not your typical fairytale, but a rugged kids adventure, which also goes into that winning is not everything, but that being in a team and playing as a team is the most important part of any sport and is good measure for a person's life.Aggressive trial lawyer Gordon Bombay has never lost a case. But when he's sentenced to a community service assignment, he must coach a ragtag team of peewee hockey players who can't skate, can't score and can't win. First he teaches the hapless team everything about winning and they teach him that winning is not everything. Watch the pucks fly as they battle their way to the most important game of their lives!This film is a great story for young up and coming sports ¬ëpeople' to watch and learn that winning is not the be all and end all of sport. Sure there are some people such as Coach Reilly, because they are not true sports lovers. Instead they treat sport as a serious event, not something that as Gordon Bombay says should be ¬ëfun'. In Australia, and my part of this country, we have Aussie Rules football, which again is a very team orientated sport. Although it can have some extraordinary individuals that play, the theme is still the same, that a team has to stick together and try as hard as it can.This movie has a very young and funny cast, with some old heads thrown in for good team balance. The obvious star is Emilio Estevez, who stars as Gordon Bombay. While he is a very aggressive character in the beginning, Gordon brings his knowledge and experience to a group of young kids that would make any sports coach proud. Estevez has had a good movie career, with some of his more well known movies being The Breakfast Club, St. Elmo's Fire, and an unaccredited role in Mission Impossible . The other main star is a very young Joshua Jackson who portrayed Charlie Conway, a good ice-hockey player, who reminds his coach a lot of himself as a young peewee hockey player. Jackson has made a name for himself in Hollywood starring in films such as Cruel Intentions, the disappointing Skulls and the popular TV drama, `Dawson's Creek'.Other cast members also include the rival coach of the Hawks Ice-Hockey team, Coach Reilly  played by veteran actor Lane Smith.  He also starred in another great film I saw recently, which happened to be on another popular sport, that of  golf, the film being `The Legend of Bagger Vance'. All the characters that are on the Mighty ducks team are likeable people. The team consists of a fat kid, a silent kid, a nice kid, a wiseacre kid, a figure-skating princess, and a tough kid. The whole formula works for me anyway.I thought that this film had some impressive Ice-Hockey scenes that looked real, though I will never know if they are real or not. Ice-Hockey is a demanding sport and this movie shows that this is the case, with heavy bumps and unrelenting pressure on players. It was good to see that this sport has both males and females playing together, again the movie shows how well the two can gel.So, if you think that sport is not your thing, but want to give it a go, perhaps this film is what you need to watch. Although this isn't the most talented group of athletes to take the ice, and in the beginning the Ducks do really ¬ësuck', they prove that with some good coaching guidance and team camaraderie, anything is possible if you put your mind to it.QUACK QUACK QUACK ¬ñ Go the Ducks!Rating: 8/10 or 4 Stars"
Top Gun: Maverick,2022,8.2,"The story involves Maverick confronting his past while training a group of younger Top Gun graduates, including the son of his deceased best friend, for a dangerous mission.","Reviewers say 'Top Gun: Maverick' is lauded for its exhilarating aerial scenes, nostalgic appeal, and standout performances by Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer. However, it is criticized for its predictable storyline, reliance on clich√©s, and insufficient character development. Some appreciate the blend of new and classic elements, while others view it as overly dependent on fan service and nostalgia. The film is generally seen as an entertaining, and high-octane experience."
D2: The Mighty Ducks,1994,6.1,Can Gordon's team win the Junior Goodwill Games in California in spite of all the set-backs?,"Rising like a phoenix from the ashes, D2 spreads its wings and soars to new heights of artistic merit.  D2 is the rarest of sequels, a sequel that is truly better than the original.  All of the jagged edges in the original film's plot have been streamlined, and the new ground being broken, (Self-Doubt, Conquering your fears, Sexual Identity) fit in seamlessly, giving this film a more robust feel, similar to that of Chunky Soup.  Emilio Estevez (In his star-making role) plays coach Bombay with a smoldering fury that makes it very clear that he is Martin Sheen's favorite son.  The rest of the cast is equally brilliant, especially the ducks themselves, whose performances are so real, you cant help believing that they are truly kids.  The direction is bold yet beautiful, and instantly recalls that of the early german surrealists.  The electronic score by Goblin is eerily effective in creating suspense in both the game and locker room scenes, and lets the viewer know that this isnt a game anymore, and that national pride is on the line.  A masterpiece of baroque visuals and dry wit, D2 is a most worthy rental upon your next excursion to the video store."
The Purge: Election Year,2016,6.0,Senator Charlie Roan and her head of security must survive an annual night of terror where all crime is legal.,"Am another person who didn't care at all for 'The Purge' from 2013. It wasn't completely unwatchable with a couple of reasonable performances and decent production values but was so tension and suspense-free and full of irritating characters, illogical character behaviours, a dull pace, a cheesy script and tired clich√©s.Had seen and heard numerous times people saying that 'The Purge: Anarchy' was a much better film. Will admit that due to disliking 'The Purge' so much, part of me was very unsure as to whether to watch 'The Purge: Anarchy' and very nearly didn't watch it. Seeing it, it was indeed a much better film. Decided too to see 'The Purge: Election Year' to see whether the series would continue to improve or whether it would wear thin. Having watched it, 'The Purge: Election Year' is far from great and has major flaws but it was not a bad watch, as far as 'The Purge' films go it is an easy second best, the best being 'Anarchy'.Visually, the slick and gritty look suits the film well and the effects and such are not as sloppy as before. It's ominously and not overbearingly scored and assured enough, while boasting enough, though with much room for more, fun, tension, eeriness and shocks. 'The Purge: Election Year' starts quite well and elaborates upon what happens before and approaches it from a different angle instead of being a re-hash.Frank Grillo is a fully committed lead, although his character was far better written in 'Anarchy'. Elizabeth Mitchell matches him with dignity and professionalism and their chemistry gives some urgency and heart. Mykelti Williamson is good fun.However, the story execution doesn't feel fresh, with tired clich√©s, very variable attempts at twists and too many parts that don't ring true and not always plausible. The character development is still wafer thin, with the villains being ciphers that are not threating and actually being pretty stupid and a few characters don't serve much point. None of the characters are quite as annoying as those in 'The Purge', but the questionable and illogical decision making and behaviours remain still.Dialogue continues to be rather weak, lacking tautness and being awkward and silly, complete with rather heavy-handed and over-emphasised political elements. Would have liked more tension and suspense, while they are here there is not enough of either, and tighter pacing would have helped, the middle act does drag.Overall, not much special but has its moments. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
Take Me Home Tonight,2011,6.3,"Four years after graduation, an awkward high school genius uses his sister's boyfriend's Labor Day party as the perfect opportunity to make his move on his high school crush.","If you didn't know any better, you'd actually think you were watching an 80s movie with Take Me Home Tonight. While not delivering the strong emotional depth of a John Hughes film, it still possesses the same qualities in its zany humor, incredible retro soundtrack and at its heart as Matt Franklin (Topher Grace) leaves his position at a lab and much to his father's disapproval begins working at a video store where Matt's young life crisis takes a bigger turn when his twin sister (Anna Faris) gets engaged, his best friend (Dan Fogler) gets fired from his job and Matt's high school crush, Tori Frederking (Teresa Palmer), comes back into his life. In true, hilarious 80s fashion, the ensemble is thrust into a crazy night of partying, mischief and self-discovery. It is a simple, unoriginal story that seems almost contained, but yet is this great adventure with characters you feel a connection to. With what seems like the perfect cast, it is only a movie of this styling (a homage to the great films of the 80s) that can have absolutely no point and still be enjoyable. From the awkward moments to those that are more sentimental, this film is just a fun time that is more or less forgettable but you have a great time with it!"
A Million Ways to Die in the West,2014,6.1,"As a cowardly farmer begins to fall for the mysterious new woman in town, he must put his newly-found courage to the test when her husband, a notorious gun-slinger, announces his arrival.","I seem to be in the minority here and probably a different age group, the upper one. Raised on westerns, my favourite source of drama in films, I have avoided this movie because of poor reviews and poor box office. I watched it last night, mainly to see Charlize Theron and was amazed how much I loved it. It opened with majestic scenes of what I took to be Monument Valley, used to such great success by John Ford in his classic westerns with John Wayne. My thoughts went almost immediately to Blazzing Saddles for comparisons, although it is much cruder but I'm used to that now in modern entertainment. Strangely I don't usually like vulgarity in humour but for some reason I overlooked it in this movie. That may be
due to the likeable performances from Seth MacFarlane and Theron. Amongst all the sillyness is a completely straight performance by Liam Neeson playing his best violent persona which is another reason why I found it worked. I never realised MacFarlane was the same actor who made Ted, which I really didn't like and for me the crude humour in that was everything I don't like about modern entertainment. Why I forgave him that for this picture is a riddle. Still, I really didn't want this film to finish. I loved the relationship build-up between MacFarlane and Theron and the supporting actors, the violent gags and the cinematography were terrific. Perhaps you have to be an old time western fan to enjoy and sadly it's a bygone genre to modern audiences judging by other comments here. 9 stars from me for the most entertaining movie of the year for me so far."
The Bonfire of the Vanities,1990,5.6,"After his mistress runs over a young teen, a Wall Street hotshot sees his life unravel in the spotlight and attracts the interest of a down-and-out reporter.","I think this is a well-crafted movie. It is an intriguing story, nicely filmed with interesting NYC locations (you will even see the former WTC towers in a few shots, which now seem poignant yet oddly sobering).I LOVE the performances: everyone comes across as quite compelling and convincing in their respective roles. (The only part that didn't work for me was when Tom Hank's character goes a little wacko with that shotgun in his apartment, but I guess I can forgive that minor deviation.)The story seems very much like a fable... and it brings to mind the old saying that every fable has its grain of truth.Go see it. It's better than critics would have you believe. (I haven't read the book, but I intend to shortly)."
Ambulance,2022,6.1,Two robbers steal an ambulance after their heist goes awry.,"Michael Bay is a great action director but he's no story teller.Stereotypical gunho cops who are outwitted by 2 criminals driving a heavy ambulance carrying 4 people ,even though they drive souped up Ford Mustangs.Good start but it goes on way too long.Also the camerawork made me go dizzy."
The World's End,2013,6.9,Five friends who reunite in an attempt to top their epic pub crawl from twenty years earlier unwittingly become humanity's only hope for survival.,"Saw it at a midnight premier last night (free Cornettos were given out!) and myself and the rest of the audience were laughing throughout, having a thoroughly enjoyable time. I thought it was great, definitely on a par with Hot Fuzz, though - to me - not quite as good as Shaun of the Dead, which is fair enough as it is one of my all-time favourites. It is definitely a worthy close to the ""trilogy"" though, and it stands up well against the other two.Amongst the highlights were seeing another former Bond actor, even if it was in a small role, along with various other regulars from the past films and Spaced - Tyres, Julia Deaking (Marsha), Bill Nighy's voice, Mark Heap, et al.With a plot as ludicrous as this one the film relies on the strength of it's leads to succeed, and they pull it off admirably. I liked that there was a role reversal of Pegg and Frost's usual character dynamic, with Frost especially noteworthy in his performance. The lads have clearly come a long way over the years. Pegg is clearly having a whale of a time, and carries us the audience along with him. Having such a talented group of back-up actors in Marsan, Considine and Freeman helps massively too.I feel they missed a trick by not using the line ""You've got blue on you"", though."
Marry Me,2022,6.1,"Music superstars Kat Valdez and Bastian are getting married before a global audience of fans. But when Kat learns, seconds before her vows, that Bastian has been unfaithful, she instead decides to marry Charlie, a stranger in the crowd.","Marry Me (2022) is a movie my wife and I saw in the movie theatre together. The storyline follows a famous pop singer about to get married when on the day of her public wedding she discovers her fianc√© cheated on her. She decides to spontaneously marry a man in the audience instead. While seemingly improbable the pop star and every day school teacher to try to make their relationship work despite very different lifestyles.This movie is directed by Kat Coiro (She-Hulk) and stars Jennifer Lopez (U-Turn), Owen Wilson (Bottle Rocket), Sarah Silverman (School of Rock),
John Bradley (Game of Thrones) and Maluma (Encanto).The storyline for this is fairly straightforward but well modernized. Wilson and Lopez deliver strong and believable performances without being too cheesy and awkward. The comedic content is inconsistent but fun and the final few scenes do a good job of creating doubt and then triumph (as you'd expect in this genre).Overall this is a fun, feel good date movie that is worth a viewing. I would score this a 6.5-7/10 and recommend seeing it once."
Secret Headquarters,2022,5.2,"While hanging out after school, Charlie and his friends discover the headquarters of the world's most powerful superhero hidden beneath his home. When villains attack, they must team up to defend the headquarters and save the world.","This is a PG kids movie along the lines of Spy Kids so it should be rated as such. Had some laughs and the kids enjoyed it. It's a 7, The people comparing it to Iron Man should give their head a shake. It's a kids movie and not a bad one."
The Informant,,8.0,"In Communist Hungary in 1985, Geri is eager to start his first year of college. But his plans are interrupted when the State Security blackmails him into spying on Zsolt Sz√°va, a radical pro-democracy leader.","Surprisingly I was Hooked from the very first minute. Great cast, plot and really good production. Despite very active show season, this one is one of the best this year. Highly recommended:)"
The Northman,2022,7.0,A young Viking prince is on a quest to avenge his father's murder.,"Well, the movie's cover/poster definitely was interesting enough to catch my attention. And I figured that with the movie's 7.8 rating on IMDb, in this writing moment, then I would be in for something grand here.And I will admit that I was excited to see what writers Sj√≥n and Robert Eggers had in store for me here with the 2 hours and 17 minutes that the movie ran for.However, I must say that while ""The Northman"" was watchable, it was ultimately just another run-of-the-mill Viking-inspired movie, for better or worse. Sure, it was a watchable movie and entertaining enough for what it was. But don't get your hopes up for this one. If you've seen other Viking movies, or TV series for that matter, then you already know what you are in for here. Yeah, director Robert Eggers didn't deviate much from the how-to-make-a-Viking-saga-movie blueprint.Visually then ""The Northman"" was interesting, as it definitely felt like an era-appropriate movie. I did like the props, costumes, sets, scenery, etc., because it definitely looked and felt like what is usually associated with the Vikings era.""The Northman"" has a good cast ensemble, with the likes of Alexander Skarsg√•rd, Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, Ethan Hawke and even Willem Dafoe. All great talents, sure, but some of them do raise a wondering sensation as to why they were cast for a Viking movie. But on the other hand, I will say that casting Icelandic singer Bj√∂rk for the movie, despite being a minor role and appearance, was just phenomenal.Something that didn't sit well with me in ""The Northman"", was the fact that it was English language based. Sure, I understand that from a wider appeal to the audience approach. But it just feels wrong having Vikings speak English, it just takes away from the atmosphere and the believability. And also the supernatural aspects were somewhat baffling to me. Sure, I understand that the Valkyries are a part of Norse lore, but having a pale woman with retainers on her teeth screaming and sitting on a flying horse just doesn't really work.I was expecting more than just your average generic Viking movie from director Robert Eggers, and I was somewhat disappointed when the movie just turned out to be a run-of-the-mill Viking movie. It could and should have been so much more, especially for a production of this magnitude.While ""The Northman"" is watchable and entertaining enough for what it turned out to be, then this is hardly a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time.My rating of ""The Northman"" lands on a six out of ten stars. It is the atmosphere, the brutality in the movie, and some of the performances that managed to snag the rating up from five to a six star rating for me."
Iliza Shlesinger: Hot Forever,,6.6,Iliza Shlesinger talks about different topics. She starts from every girl's ugly bra to how all adult men need to own a box spring.,".... Now she's only funny to her base.There's no ""edge"" here. No ""sharp"" wit. She gets on stage and then proceeds to speak as fast as she possibly can, and repeat the same lines at least 4 times... over and over. As if repeating a rather dull ""joke"" makes it funnier. It doesn't. The speed at which she speaks almost makes it seem she as if she just wants to get it over with as quickly as possible. Her comedic timing is REALLY lacking in this special.I think she may be suffering from a glass bubble. She's risen to the level where of course she has fans. Fans that will follow her regardless of what she says/creates - ""fangurlz"". So, who turns out to those ""run up"" shows where she is testing new jokes.... those fans obviously. Which, I'd guess, are mostly women around 40. So which jokes ""work"" or not in these ""test"" shows is all based on these audiences of predominantly older ""fangurlz"". And that is glaringly obvious in this special. It's a special which is nearly entirely geared towards women 40 or older.Now, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. But it does kill off the non-40-year-old female fans she may have had. 30 minute bits about bras just isn't funny to me. I'll never understand why audiences seemingly ""roar"" just because she does some silly voice. A flat ""joke"" delivered in a silly voice is still a flat ""joke.""When she started her career she was fantastic and mixing things up and making ANY audience member laugh. She timed delivery, and took breaths, so things could be ingested as opposed to rattling off line after line. Now, she's just focusing on speed and making older women laugh. This special is really rather poor, that is unless you're a ""fangurl.""I had a VERY hard time finding much humor in this special... probably I'm not an older woman who is down on men and finds bras funny."
Spencer,2021,6.5,"Diana Spencer, struggling with mental-health problems during her Christmas holidays with the Royal Family at their Sandringham estate in Norfolk, England, decides to end her decade-long marriage to Prince Charles.","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)""I knew absolutely nothing about this movie beforehand. I heard/read extraordinarily positive reactions that definitely elevated my expectations. And my actual knowledge about Princess Diana and her life was and still is extremely basic. Spencer is one of those rare examples where going into it completely blind didn't work in my favor at all. I found myself trying to look for something to grab on to, and despite some genuinely outstanding technical attributes, Steven Knight's (Locked Down) screenplay doesn't offer me enough to hold my attention.Spencer is undoubtedly a fictional character piece that only stands on its feet due to one of the year's most mesmerizing lead performances. Kristen Stewart (Underwater), an actress who still gets a lot of unfair hate despite her clear evolution to one of the most underrated actors working today, delivers a career-defining portrayal of Princess Diana that viewers will hardly forget about. I can't recall the last time I witnessed an actor completely disappearing into their role. A true masterclass worthy of every single award. The rest of the cast is also superb.Technically, I also have little to complain about. Pablo Larra√≠n's (Jackie) distinct direction adequately fits the frustrating, claustrophobic story, and I love how Claire Mathon's (Portrait of a Lady on Fire) moves between the intimate close-ups and gorgeous wide shots. As expected, costume and production design look fabulous, but Jonny Greenwood's (You Were Never Really Here) score didn't work for me. The mix of jazz with high-tension sequences becomes too uncanny, distracting the viewers from the narrative, which leads me to my main issue.For someone with my knowledge and expectations, Spencer becomes one of those ""nothing happens"" films that usually surprises viewers with its unique storytelling approach. I'm all-in for this type of work, but outside of Stewart's display, I struggled to feel captivated by whatever was going on. A supposedly consistently interesting character study transformed into an overlong, repetitive one-woman show, where I couldn't figure out what it was aiming for. I understand the purpose of making the audience feel how Diana felt during her marriage and living within British Royalty, but Larra√≠n's execution somehow fails to leave me emotionally satisfied.A second viewing will probably improve and strengthen my opinion about the movie. For now, I feel very mixed about Spencer, but I'll leave this as a positive review trusting that I'll gradually enjoy it more after each viewing.""Rating: B-"
Don't Worry Darling,2022,6.3,"While her husband leaves home every day to work in a top secret facility, a young 1950s housewife begins to question her life when she notices strange behavior from the other wives in the neighborhood.","Reviewers say 'Don't Worry Darling' is a 1950s-set psychological thriller with themes of control and reality. Florence Pugh and Chris Pine deliver strong performances, and the film boasts striking cinematography. However, critics find issues with plot coherence, pacing, and social commentary depth. Direction and screenplay receive mixed reviews, with some praising atmosphere and others deeming it derivative. Behind-the-scenes drama also affects perceptions, leading to varied opinions on the film's quality."
Elvis,2022,7.3,"The life of American music icon Elvis Presley, from his childhood to becoming a rock and movie star in the 1950s while maintaining a complex relationship with his manager, Colonel Tom Parker.","Firstly Austin Butler was great , he could actually be Elvis as he looked so much like him and clearly worked hard to do Elvis justice , but I didn't really enjoy the movie but can't put my finger on why , the Main actors did a good job but I couldn't really get an emotional connection with them or the story line until the very end , I thought the legend Tom Hanks had too much of a part to play and Elvis didn't get enough , the story seemed to bounce all over the place and to me just felt and bit disjointed , Im no movie critic or expert so I recommend seeing it as lots have really raved about it but I woo the be watching it again."
"Szia, √âletem!",2022,6.5,A burnt-out writer's life is turned upside down when his never-before-seen son walks into his life.,"My wife and i didnt expect much when we started this movie. We were wrong. A simple but charming story, the actors are very decent and the chemistry between the father and child is excellent. The flow of the movie is very much on point, we never once felt bored. 10 minutes into the movie and were already hooked. Althoug the story was already told 100 times before, still felt refreshing. I believe most of the jokes are aimed at hungarian audience, but it can be fun in other languages too. We laughed a lot and also got emotional at some point. This movie is a great a choice to get away from the mass produced hollywood movies."
That '90s Show,,6.3,"Now it's 1995, Leia Forman is visiting her grandparents for the summer where she bonds with a new generation of Point Place, WI, kids under the watchful eye of Kitty and the stern glare of Red.","Reviewers say 'That '90s Show' receives mixed reception, highlighting nostalgic returns of Red and Kitty, whose performances are consistently enjoyable. Criticisms target the new cast, deemed less charming and lacking chemistry compared to the original series. Disappointments arise from the show's failure to authentically capture the 1990s, with outdated costumes, dialogue, and cultural references. The writing is often criticized for being uninspired, lacking the humor and depth of 'That '70s Show'. Despite these issues, some find enjoyment in lighter moments and see potential for future growth."
Luckiest Girl Alive,2022,6.4,"A woman in New York, who seems to have things under control, is faced with a trauma that makes her life unravel.","I have to say, I had my fair share of the doubt during the first 30 minutes or so, because it started off as a typical rom com with a quirky protagonist.But I'm glad I gave it a chance, because once it picks up, it's done masterfully. I was afraid at some point it would slide to ""who done it"" kind of a thriller, but fortunately that never happened.That is not to say there isn't mystery. It's just properly balanced, so it never feels over the top. Characters are believable and much more nuanced than you typically get in this type of dramas.We all heard a stories like this, but they are rarely explored respectfully and without going over the top. However, this movie manages to do it.I'm glad the writers didn't go for twists and turns, but stayed true to the message they wanted to deliver. And it is a message we all need to hear."
Gabriel Iglesias: Stadium Fluffy,,7.1,"Features Gabriel ""Fluffy"" Iglesias as he talks about growing up in Los Angeles, an attempt at extortion towards him, and where he holds the record for receiving the highest fine on stage.","I saw Stadium Fluffy last night, and I simply enjoyed it... And that's not necessarily a great compliment. When I watch a Fluffy show, I know it will be nothing but big laughs the entire show. You're going to bust out laughing the whole show. So, if you merely just enjoyed it, then it's somewhat of a disappointment compared to his previous work.The venue itself (Dodger Stadium) was basically also a star of the show. So Gabiel needed great material that was worthy of the great venue. That material simply did not live up to it... at times. A lot of the show was hit or miss with the impact of the jokes.I did notice that more of Gabriel's stories were just that... Stories, not jokes. I expected more rapid fire jokes in his stories. But at times they were few and far between in Stadium Fluffy. I don't mind Gabriel telling us stories about his life. After all, that's what his stand-up material is based off. That's his bread and butter and he should stick to that formula. But all I ask is to be more consistent about the funny delivery of those stories.Good entertainment, but not Fluffy's best."
Enola Holmes 2,2022,6.8,"Now a detective-for-hire, Enola Holmes takes on her first official case to find a missing girl as the sparks of a dangerous conspiracy ignite a mystery that requires the help of friends - and Sherlock himself - to unravel.","Enola Holmes, now a Private Detective in her own right is employed to search for a missing girl.It's good, for the most part I enjoyed it, as with the first, I wish I'd kept it for boxing day tea, it would have been the perfect family adventure. It's very, very similar to the first, if you enjoyed that, I'm sure you'll enjoy this, if you hated it, there's nothing dissimilar here, more of the same.Good storyline, very imaginative and creative, very good production values too, it looked pretty great I thought.A shame that Mycroft didn't appear, I enjoyed his character in the first film, it did allow Sherlock to get more focus, and that was great, but perhaps also some of the problem, when Cavill is on screen as Sherlock Holmes, he does overtake, it was him I wanted to see more of.Enola herself, I liked her more than I did in the first film, I look forward to seeing her develop even further in the third.6/10."
We're the Millers: The Miller Makeovers,,7.1,One of 9 Behind the Scenes DVD extras from the release of We're the Millers 2,
Iliza Shlesinger: Freezing Hot,,6.8,"Smart and brazen comedian Iliza Shlesinger applies her fresh, laugh-out-loud perspective to the universal struggles between men and women.","In this special Iliza's act was really well put together and very funny. Unlike her special War Paint there seemed to be fewer long, unfunny bits, and some of the more repetitive parts from that special were toned down (the weird goat/sheep noises).So far this has been her peak, and it deserves to be watched."
Suits,,8.4,"On the run from a drug deal gone bad, brilliant college dropout Mike Ross finds himself working with Harvey Specter, one of New York City's best lawyers.","Reviewers say 'Suits' is lauded for its witty dialogue, sharp writing, and dynamic performances, especially from Gabriel Macht and Patrick J. Adams. Ambition, power, and redemption themes captivate, though some find characters one-dimensional and plots predictable. The unrealistic premise and key character departures are criticized, yet the blend of drama, humor, and legal maneuvering is appreciated. The ensemble cast and character development are strengths, but reliance on shouting matches and unrealistic scenarios are noted flaws."
Murder Mystery 2,2023,5.7,Full-time detectives Nick and Audrey are struggling to get their private eye agency off the ground. They find themselves at the center of international abduction when their friend Maharaja is kidnapped at his own lavish wedding.,"Adam is still going strong in all facets of his career and actually getting a bit of long deserved recognition of late (Mark Twain Award). His comedy is universally loved even in the most basic of regurgitated Hollywood plots. This is another case of that. This builds more on the action side of the couple's escapades but delivers in the standard laughs ten fold. Anniston proves once again she is a terrific match for an on screen love interest for Sandler. Their chemistry is never missing a beat. The story becomes just a backdrop for their antics to shine. While some of the forced modern rhetoric is grating at times, the film is a solid comedy. Know what you're getting and it's a fun time."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery,2022,7.1,"Tech billionaire Miles Bron invites his friends for a getaway on his private Greek island. When someone turns up dead, Detective Benoit Blanc is put on the case.","The long-awaited sequel to Knives Out is here, and although it's still a good time, it feels like a let down overall.The first film told such a unique and superb mystery that wrapped layers upon layers on top of each other. Meanwhile, Glass Onion tells a story that feels incredibly basic in comparison.The main problem with this film is that although it's a mystery film, it doesn't give you the tools to solve the mystery. Instead the film walks through the plot and witholds infomation to have big reveals, rather than giving you the clues to work it out yourself.Daniel Craig was fun the the cast was good overall, with Ed Norton being a big standout. Some characters felt wasted sadly.Overall, a fun but underwhelming time."

Blockbuster,,5.1,"This comedy set in the last Blockbuster Video in America explores what, and who, makes a small business succeed.","I couldn't even make it through the first episode. It just really wasn't funny to me at all. It didn't bring back any nostalgic feelings of renting videos. But then again, blockbuster in my opinion is the least nostalgic of any place that I rented videos. Once blockbuster became big, it felt more corporate. Video update, AV Video, and others are much more nostalgic, as someone who grew up in the late 80s, 90s and early 2000s. I was very disappointed because I love shows like superstore, parks and rec, the office, Brooklyn 99 (aside from the newest season which I couldn't stand), etc. This just felt poorly written. The lead actor is not a good fit for the role at all and I couldn't relate with the teenagers at all. Melissa fumero is also one of my least favorite Brooklyn 99 actresses. I had high hopes, but sadly, I cannot continue with this show."
Your Place or Mine,2023,5.7,Two long-distance best friends change each other's lives when she decides to pursue a lifelong dream and he volunteers to keep an eye on her teenage son.,"I enjoyed this romantic comedy starring Reese Witherspoon and Ashton Kutcher...maybe because I am of a similar age? I loved the Cars heavy soundtrack and how it was tied into the storyline with Peter Coleman's father. I thought it was slightly different for a romantic comedy in that our two romantic leads have little to no time together in the whole film...and yet their love story is believable as they have been friends for twenty years! I did like the very Pillowtalk approach of having a split screen depicting the two in their very contrasting lives.I enjoyed the humor and droll delivery of Tig Nataro and the quirky lines by Steven Zahn as the unpaid billionaire gardener/neighbor who is playing ""the long game"". ""Begonias while you're Be-gone?""But my favorite character was actually Minka played by Zoe Chao...beautiful with great comedic timing!If you are a romantic comedy fan, I say give this a watch...you just might find, like me, that you enjoy it."
Nyugati nyaral√°s,2022,5.7,"Gyuri Maurer's family is about to go on holiday, but instead of four passports, only three arrive. Instead of heading west with a German car and the accompanying papers, they will be tourists coming from the west.","Full-scope and very entertaining demo of the 1980s Hungary. Surely not WW2 epic or a zillion dollar production sci-fi but is really worth an evening, funny and nostalgic panoramic view of a holiday by Lake Balaton, with little action and much humor added. All packed into easily digestible 90mins. Costumes, scenery, characters all right in place. Even with a careful attention to the grins, typical phrases and for sure near-to-oldtimer cars. A must-see for Hungarian people ages 35 and up, but also strongly recommended below that, starting with older teenagers. Just that they know how different their childhood is compared to what the 'old folks' around them had."
Im Westen nichts Neues,2022,7.8,A young German soldier's eagerness to serve his country quickly fades when he witnesses the horrors of combat on the Western Front during World War I.,"A fascinating film with potential that was never fully achieved. ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" does not rely solely on shock value to disturb its audience; instead, it uses the horrors of war to sober them with facts and dismal realities. The film's story was worth telling; it left an impression long after the credits rolled. It dealt with many weighty themes, including a young man's journey through war, the difficulties of combat, the cruelty of desperation, and the value of friendship and camaraderie, all of which were handled with grace and artistry. Furthermore, it boasted first-rate production values, breathtaking visuals, a terrific score (although maybe a tad bit over the top), and stellar acting. Although there is much to praise about the film, ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is ultimately hampered by its drawn-out length, the plot dragging in spots, and several confusing moments. All the pieces were in place for ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" to be the best picture of the year, and in some respects, it is. Fans of the genre, or anyone who appreciates a well-made film, should not miss this film despite its limitations.Rating: 7.5/10 (Impressive)"

The School for Good and Evil,2022,5.9,Best friends Sophie and Agatha find themselves on opposing sides of an epic battle when they're swept away into an enchanted school where aspiring heroes and villains are trained to protect the balance between Good and Evil.,"That 2:30mins of my life I will never get back. I don't even know where to start, there wasn't a SINGLE good thing about the movie (if you can even call it that) . Putting famous actors in it didn't even help, if anything it made it worse because we were watching people we KNOW to be good at their work get turned into a joke with movies like this. You money Hungry producers don't even know how to make movies anymore. The plot was extremely rushed, there was NO character building, NO EXPLAINATIONS to Anything. Cheesiest, most predictable ""Plot Twist"" ever, not ONE likable character, Trash film ."
Space Force,,6.7,The people tasked with creating a sixth branch of the armed services: The Space Force.,"""Space Force"" trade marked by Netflix before the United State government, this Steve Carell comedy is surprising. Not a particular fan of Carell's typical low-brow comedy, but somehow this contemporary comedic vehicle retains a wry intellectual wit about it, probably greatly helped along with the dynamism between Carell and award-winning actor, John Malkovich. The fresh take and parody of America's newest military branch has delightful scenes that pit science versus human intuition along with a decent rather unique set of family dynamics. Each episode somehow incorporates a sensitive and powerful emotive message and performance by Carell. An entertaining and actually captivating series that easy and fun to watch along with a heartful storyline."
The Crew,,6.5,Life in the garage swerves off track for a NASCAR crew chief and his tight-knit racing team when a new boss steps in and shakes things up.,"I like the show being about NASCAR. The cameos from real drivers are so great. A funny show. I love Kevin James, some of the material is a little familiar, but it's a good familiar."
The Redeem Team,2022,7.4,"Follows the story of the 2008 U.S. Olympic Men's Basketball team and how ""The Redeem Team"" set a new standard for American basketball.","The NBA represents the best of the best in basketball. Every kid with a gaming console knows it. So when America gets beaten at one of their own national sport, it's incredibly humbling, and embarrassing.The Redeem Team tells a gripping behind-the-scenes look at how individual superstars came together as a team, so that the American flag, and anthem, could return back to the gold medal podium. The leadership, the stepping up, the discipline, the pride of the country over individual egos... all for America... is an incredible story put together brilliantly in this documentary.A very good sports documentary indeed that's more than worth your time."
Egy√ºtt kezdt√ºk,2022,6.4,"A coming of age story, in flashback, of a group of high school students graduating in 2011. Each will take a different path from here on.","Honestly it's such a vibe. Presents the tipical Hungarian holiday perfectly, summer feeling, nostalgia. I loved it a lot. Really Hungarian, but in the good way, surprisingly. The jokes, the characters, all of it is just so comforting and so relatable as a Hungarian (but I think for every Easter/middle European person). The videography is so beautiful too. Mucsi and Kany√≥ Kata owned the show. I haven't laughed this much in a Hungarian movie since Bu√©k (2018). It definitely deserves more attention. It's really cool it's on Netflix now, maybe that will get it some more hype. I think you should give it a try!"
Wanderlust,2012,5.6,"Rattled by sudden unemployment, a Manhattan couple surveys alternative living options, ultimately deciding to experiment with living on a rural commune where free love rules.",There are a lot of scenes in this movie that I laughed out loud at. Paul Rudd is incredible at creating very uncomfortably funny moments with his awkwardness. Key and Peele are also in this movie and both have some pretty funny roles. I don't understand the bad ratings for this because I found it to be a fun film to watch. They have some reoccurring jokes that hit just enough to not be overdone as well. Everyone did a good job acting as well.
The Shawshank Redemption,1994,9.3,"A banker convicted of uxoricide forms a friendship over a quarter century with a hardened convict, while maintaining his innocence and trying to remain hopeful through simple compassion.","Reviewers say 'The Shawshank Redemption' is celebrated for its themes of hope and friendship, with exceptional performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Its portrayal of human spirit and institutional corruption is impactful. However, some find it overly sentimental and predictable, lacking originality. A few question its status among the greatest films due to its conventional narrative and lack of technical innovation. Its emotional resonance and timeless message remain widely acclaimed."
Dave Chappelle: The Closer,,7.9,"As he closes out his slate of comedy specials, Dave takes the stage to try and set the record straight; and get a few things off his chest.",I get why Dave is taking a break; the world is becoming a stranger place; i just hope we can all do better in the future.

The Mother,2023,5.6,"While fleeing from dangerous assailants, an assassin comes out of hiding to protect the daughter she left earlier in life.","Right, an action thriller starring Jennifer Lopez, I can't really claim that I was particularly harboring much of any grand expectations to the movie as I stumbled upon it on Netflix. In fact, I had actually never heard about the movie prior to sitting down to watch it.The synopsis for the movie seemed fair enough, and I will say that writers Misha Green, Andrea Berloff and Peter Craig put together a fair enough script and storyline for the movie. It wasn't exactly a story that brought much innovation with it, but I will say that ""The Mother"" was sufficiently entertaining for a single viewing. And it should be noted that the storyline was actually somewhat clich√© and generic, which made it rather predictable.The pacing of the narrative throughout the 115 minutes that the movie ran for was okay. The movie did feel a bit sluggish at times, and could perhaps have benefitted from a more efficient trim in the editing room.The acting performances in the movie were fair enough, and Jennifer Lopez actually fared adequately enough in the movie and in this type of genre. So she has the ability to perform outside of romantic comedies. She was joined on the screen by Omari Hardwick and Joseph Fiennes, as the only familiar faces among the cast list for me.All in all, ""The Mother"" is a watchable movie, entertaining enough for what it turned out to be. Just don't expect to be in for anything that haven't already been done or seen in the genre before. However, it is a movie that ultimately doesn't have enough meat on it to support more than just a single viewing. And the movie's predictability sort of stole away from both the action and thriller aspects of the script.My rating of director Niki Caro's 2023 action thriller ""The Mother"" lands on a five out of ten stars."
#Sohav√©getnem√©r√∂s,2016,5.6,"Wellhello is a Hungarian music band whose song combine the stories of the movie.

Fast & Furious 9,2021,5.2,Dom and the crew must take on an international terrorist who turns out to be Dom and Mia's estranged brother.,"Reviewers say 'F9' offers thrilling action and signature car chases, but faces criticism for its unrealistic plot and exaggerated stunts. The film's exploration of Dom's backstory and reintroduction of characters receive mixed feedback. While some praise the action sequences and character interactions, others find it less coherent than previous installments. Overall, 'F9' is seen as entertaining yet flawed, appealing to fans for its escapist value while disappointing those seeking a more logical narrative."

Extraction,2020,6.8,"Tyler Rake, a fearless black market mercenary, embarks on the most deadly extraction of his career when he's enlisted to rescue the kidnapped son of an imprisoned international crime lord.","The latest Netflix original film to arrive on the streaming service. Extraction sees Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth), a black market mercenary, embark on the most deadly extraction of his career when he's enlisted to rescue the kidnapped son (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) of an imprisoned international crime lord.As much as their originals are hit and miss and the sheer amount of content they release being ridiculous, there is no question that Netflix allow pure filmmaker freedom without the restrictions and interference of Hollywood influence as here the film is allowed to make full use of its 18 rating and not have the burden of setting up or continuing a franchise. Though generic and cliche in its story telling, the action and stunt work are an absolute blast to witness and make this a step up from what I was expecting.The film's 2 hour runtime may have some filler sequences around the middle section, but the 1st and 3rd acts are fast paced and frantic, throwing you right into the situation, the film knows exactly what it wants and sets out to deliver it. The race against time and constant improvisation of the extraction itself makes for a consistently engaging watch, though the film does brush over motivations (the villain here is especially lacklustre) and character back story, with Tyler solely relying on a few flashbacks and essentially an exposition interview with the kid he is protecting, so that we get more of his story.However what this basic premise does allow for is to be filled with brutal, well choreographed and creative action. This film delivers one of the best set pieces of this year, with a phenomenal one-take style 15 minute sequence, which goes from a car chase, to a building assault to a lorry chase, it's absolute controlled chaos. As a fan of John Wick, The Raid etc. it was excellent to see their influence on the choreography, the camerawork never is too shaky or quick cutting meaning it is easy to follow and witness every stab, punch, kick in their bone crunching and visceral glory. The shootouts sound great and are intense, always ending in bloody results, especially the finale sequence.It's good seeing Hemsworth in a grittier, darker non-Thor/MIB role and he delivers here in a more somber and focused role, though also channels some of the action hero vibe of the 80/90's that this film is going for. Jaiswal is also good here as the kid thrown into this life or death situation, he is never irritating or acts unrealistically at all (which is the case with kids in these types of films at times). Randeep Hooda has an intimidating screen presence as someone working for the kid's father and David Harbour gives an enthusiastic performance, though his character's section does stall the plot pacing.Extraction is a fun watch to turn your brain off for 2 hours and was actually better than I expected. The action is bloody, visceral and frantic with some brilliant practical effects and choreography and the cast give good performances. The film does suffer from several cliches and genre traits and lack of character depth, but honestly from a purely entertainment perspective this does the job."
Sarah Silverman: A Speck of Dust,,6.9,"In her first comedy special post-health scare, Sarah Silverman shares a mix of fun facts, sad truths and yeah-she-just-went-there moments.","Sarah Silverman delivers a compelling, funny routine which closes with her personal medical emergency. First, she starts off the show with metal detectors and death threat. While the audience laughed heartily, I felt a little discombobulated. It's the times we live in and that particular issue is hard to laugh at. Although if I was in the audience, the laughing could be quite cathartic. Anyways, she quickly moves on. With complaining Jew and laser hair removal, the routine builds up well. There is good flow and consistent laughs. Of course, there is plenty of abortion jokes amid the present political climate. At one point, she asks for any religious audience members and only one Lutheran volunteered. The medical emergency is quite funny and there is a fun video proof of its reality to close out the special. In the end, this is standard Silverman comedy with her deadpan delivery and outrageous material. It is a solid one hour show."
Hustle,2022,7.3,A basketball scout discovers a phenomenal street ball player while in Spain and sees the prospect as his opportunity to get back into the NBA.,"If you're like me and enjoy feel good sports movies you will enjoy this. Seems like years since anyone got one right. The way it ends is a little bit flat, but still enjoyable.I know some bag on him, but I'm enjoying this new era Adam Sandler. He pulls it off."
Iliza: Confirmed Kills,,6.6,"Iliza Shlesinger performs in this standup talking about dating, feminism and some of the intricacies associated with being a woman in the 21st century.","I was not familiar with Iliza Shlesinger before I watched this. This was my first time watching her work. She was exceptionally funny in this special for Netflix. Covering topics ranging from Party Goblins, mermaids, ugly giants, the differences between the generations and the sexes; the special was a fast paced roller coaster of laughs. Iliza's humor seems to both understand and hate her status as a millennial. Due to this her humor definitely strikes a cord for a younger audience. The special ends with a hilarious Shark Tank bit. I was really impressed with her intensity throughout. The way she punctuates her jokes with screams at just the right moments reminds me of Sam Kinison. Her use of exaggerated body language and frequently acting out her jokes reminds me of Sebastion Maniscalco. She is a commanding comedic performer and I look forward to watching her other specials."
6 Underground,2019,6.1,It follows a group of people who fake their deaths and decide to form a vigilante team in order to stage a coup d'√©tat against a ruthless dictator.,"This is a typical modern Michael Bay film, it's all style over substance. Leave your brain at the door and you might enjoy it, I wish I did but I didn't.I'll give you a quick example of what to expect while trying to explain why I couldn't bring myself to enjoy this film. Opening scene is a 15 minute car chase through a city. Firstly, the vehicle they choose to use as a getaway vehicle is a bright neon green Alfa Romeo that sticks out in the crowd like a sore thumb driving a bright neon green sports car would. Why would anyone choose this as a getaway vehicle instead of a car with a paint job a bit more inconspicuous I hear you ask? Because it's a Michael Bay film that's why, and it's all about style remember? Secondly, every car and bike that crashes during the chase produces enough sparks and fire to rival the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics, plus the sounds they make when they crash are the most ridiculous Transformers sounding noises I have ever heard outside of a Transformers movie. And lastly, the bright neon green sports car gets scratched up by another vehicle and the drivers side mirror gets knocked off, but the next shot it's back on again, then it's off, then it's on, and it switches between broken and not broken a dozen or so times before someone decided that for continuity sake we better just stick to one or the other and thankfully they chose to go with the broken one. Pretty sloppy filmmaking really, and this is all in the opening 15 - 20 minutes, and unfortunately I can't turn my brain off enough to enjoy a film like that.Other things that I didn't like about the film, the overall story is laughable and makes absolutely no sense at all, and when I say no sense I'm not being hyperbolic I mean it makes no sense, from the people he chooses to join his team to the way he recruits them to the missions they do it's all so ludicrous, if you allow yourself to question its logic for even one second then the entire thing falls apart. It's got your typical Michael Bay hit or miss humor along with other ""Bayerisms"" that we've come to expect from him, like the over use of quick cuts during action sequences, low angle shots of women in short skirts, so much slow motion that if the slow motion parts were at normal speed I reckon the film would be about half an hour shorter than it is, and scenes that are meant to be emotional and pull on your heart strings but because every character has no depth to them they end up having about as much emotional impact as a carpet cleaning commercial does.What I did like. CGI people getting hit by cars and caught in explosions and thrown around and stuff, it was completely overused but the first few times it happened it looked quite good, especially people getting side swiped by vehicles. Some of the bad guy kills were well done. I enjoyed most of the banter between Ryan Reynolds and the non Ryan Reynolds actors, it was funny and was just Ryan Reynolds being your typical Ryan Reynolds which is good if you like Ryan Reynolds and I like Ryan Reynolds. Who doesn't like Ryan Reynolds? Hugh Jackman that's who, the Canadian fraud.It really is just a film full of loud noises, bright colors, explosions and little of anything else."
When We First Met,2018,6.4,"Noah meets Avery at a Halloween party and falls in love but gets friend-zoned. 3 years later, she's engaged to someone else. Noah returns in a time machine to fix things.","Honestly, I went into this movie with low expectations, and I came out pleasantly surprised and amused. I like Adam Devine, especially his work in Workaholics, and find him quite funny. Alexandra Daddario, in my most humble opinion, is such a total BABE; so fine omg. Anyway, I digress; this movie was just super wholesome and left you with a good warm feeling when you finished it. Sure it was cliche at moments and you could basically predict the plot if you're an avid movie watcher, but I don't think that takes away from the movie in general. If you came into this movie expecting an oscar-winning crazy complex contemporary movie that made you really think about it's major themes and underlying messages then I'm sorry but you're going to be sorely disappointed. However, if you go into this movie with an open mind, a fun mood, and some popcorn, I believe you will come to enjoy this movie for what it is: a Wholesome Feelgood Romcom."
Triple Frontier,2019,6.5,"Loyalties are tested when five friends and former special forces operatives reunite to take down a South American drug lord, unleashing a chain of unintended consequences.","Five ex-military veterans reunite to rip off a drug lord, but like every other robbery in movie history, it does not go as planned. Despite a sturdy premise, ""Triple Frontier"" is curiously inert, shallow and un-involving. Despite a strong cast (Affleck, Isaac, Hunnam, Pascal and Hedlund) it feels like the characters are flimsy and inconsistent. The most tension filled scene is the robbery itself, which surprisingly happens early on into the run time. The length of the film is also a bit challenging at times and seems to drag on. As a result, it is a film that is competently made so you are not really seeing a bad film 'per se', but then it is also an uninspired film, so you won't see anything that goes above mediocre for most of its run time. It felt like there was a lot of potential here, but somewhere along the way it got lost and we ended up with its shadow instead.Rating: 6+"
Wine Country,2019,5.5,"During a vacation to Napa Valley, a group of long time friends reunite and revisit past choices in this hilarious and heartfelt comedy from director Amy Poehler.","This film tells the story of six friends who go to Napa Valley for a holiday.The scenery and the house are both beautiful. However, that's pretty much the end of the good points. The pace is very slow, and the jokes are not funny. The art show scene falls completely flat and is completely lost on me. The characters aren't having fun, and the viewers aren't either."
Like Father,2018,6.1,"After she's left at the altar, a workaholic advertising executive ends up on her Caribbean honeymoon cruise with her estranged father.","Yes, yes, it's good publicity for Royal Caribbean, you know that within a few minutes. Best to move on and enjoy the great characters, nicely acted, playing out a story that's not always as predictable as it could be, against great scenery. Faint praise? Not really, this is firmly a genre piece, but the characters are more nuanced than usual, with Grammer's Harry especially interesting. We enjoyed it loads and found it rather touching."
Extraction 2,2023,7.0,"After barely surviving his grievous wounds from his mission in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Tyler Rake is back, and his team is ready to take on their next mission.","'Extraction 2' is the kind of movie I call a ""time-killer"". Say you have 2 hours until a dinner you're looking forward to and you want the time to pass quickly, you put on 'Extraction 2' and before you know it it's time for dinner. You then proceed to never think about the film again for the rest of your life, because there is absolutely nothing memorable about it. There's no problem with these types of movies, we need them. But you can't get angry at people finding them instantly forgettable. There's no true emotional depth to them, try as they may.It is worth noting that there is an incredible ""single-take"" scene early in this film that was done phenomenally well. The work that must've gone into pulling it off, I can't even imagine. It's the highlight of the movie by a comfortable margin. The only problem I find with these scenes is that it takes me about 6 minutes to click onto the fact I'm watching a ""single-take"".The film has a decent villain and the pacing is pretty good. It's an above average action movie and worth your time for sure if this is your kind of thing. 7/10."
Date Night,2010,6.3,"In New York City, a case of mistaken identity turns a bored married couple's attempt at a glamorous and romantic evening into something more thrilling and dangerous.","Predictable? Sure, this ain't a comedy that pretends to be more than a vehicle for the comedic abilities of the very likable Tina Fey and the sometimes over-the-top (but not so much in this movie) Steve Carrell.Aside from the surprising cameos in this show, there aren't much surprises. This is one of those movies where there's a couple that's been in a somewhat fixed circle of boredom in their lives. Heck, even their regular date nights have been very predictable.Steve and Tina are the Fosters; upon finding out that one of their closest couple friends are splitting up, they try to spice things up by having a date in the city. In a case of mistaken identity, their would-be date night winds up an action-filled, sometimes funny evening. Except for a few scenes, this movie isn't anything innovative; but it's still nice to see Steve and Tina play likable characters.The producers of this flick know what they have in these two actors, and the movie is enough to give their comedic and acting chops (nothing like Steve's nice acting ability in Dan in Real Life) a little flexing. With this knowledge, I still recommend this movie to those who want to enjoy a little break from the action-3D-filled movies out there now. A little date with your significant other watching this movie would be good."
Asteroid City,2023,6.4,World-changing events spectacularly disrupt the annual Asteroid Day celebration in an American desert town.,"Wes Anderson has always been a favorite director of mine. I have seen all his movies - but for me, the magic is gone.I feel like The Grand Budapest Hotel was his masterpiece. Where every aspect that makes his films special was at its peak. The characters, the cast, the sets and, of course, the visuals were up to an 11. His craft was perfected - and it's one of my top 5 films of all time.When I saw Isle of Dogs, I started to feel full. I felt like I had seen Wes's style a bit too much. And now this.I feel that Asteroid City is pretty bland. The visuals are fantastic - but we've seen this all before. Instead of a compelling lead who has an interesting problem to solve - we get several bland characters who are quirky, and that's it. The acting is great though. But it's not that funny nor intriguing.We were eight friends who saw this film together. Every one of us was pretty bored after a while. One of us really liked it though - but she had only seen 50% of a Wes Anderson film before. The rest of us felt... full."
Bo Burnham: Make Happy,,8.3,"Bo Burnham tackles life, death, sexuality, hypocrisy, mental illness and Pringles cans in his dazzling new stand-up special.","I know I said I wasn't posting another review for a while, but I have a couple days free so here you are.I've been following Bo Burnham since ""words words words"" and ever since 2010 his work has only improved (I'll have to rewatch ""what""). It's clear to me that he is an extremely intelligent person who understands humanity.He injects personal more ""serious"" elements into his act which actually resonate with me a lot. He touches on mental health/illness which is something that has affected me for a long time, he touches upon this among other things.All the songs are great, I especially enjoyed the country song, it's perfect satire and commentary on modern music as a whole, not just country music.I could talk about Bo Burnham for ages but I'm not going to. He's one of the most intelligent celebrities working today, I feel this way about a few comedians funnily enough.Before you go, if you don't mind answering I have a genuine question... Are you happy?"
Andrew Schulz: Infamous,,7.6,"Andrew Schulz delivers his latest comedy special INFAMOUS, a daring, raw performance filmed during his 10 month sold-out' ""Infamous Tour"" at The Paramount in Austin. TX.","Outstanding...Might be a bit hard to follow for people un-familiar with American pop-culture and politics lately, but I absolutely loved it. He is dedicated, whitty with fast-mind."
The 355,2022,5.6,"When a top-secret weapon falls into mercenary hands, a wild-card C.I.A. agent joins forces with three international agents on a mission to retrieve it, while staying a step ahead of a mysterious woman who's tracking their every move.","Wanna carve out two hours for this sucker? I've seen worse. I've seen Anna.Imagine a world where wanted killers weave though bustling marketplaces brandishing weapons in plain view, attacking victims, and disappearing before anyone's the wiser. Or a hacker who puts Mr. Robot to shame, instantly and effortlessly breaking into a network with every live security camera in a major European city, just by twiddling her fingers over a keyboard. Welcome to The 355.""It's a movie,"" you say. Of course. One must suspend disbelief for a hot minute. But that becomes quite a chore when you're given one believable character out of four. The tired espionage tropes become exhausted, and a comprehensive plot summary can be deduced after 30 minutes, less if you're keen on these things. Action sequences quick cut like a movie trailer. Stock villains. Cringe subtext. The litany of cinema transgressions runs long. And the chuckles and groans filling the theatre were proof.But I've been harsh. The protagonists get decent backstory treatment and are forced to make difficult choices. The sound and music amp up the excitement nicely. There's some chemistry between the cast, and they do the best with what they're given. While Chastain seems out of place here, I'll shrug and acknowledge the effort since not much else was believable. And I wasn't bored watching it. I guess it comes down to how bored you are before you decide to watch it."
The Last Thing He Wanted,2020,4.4,A veteran D.C. journalist loses the thread of her own narrative when a guilt-propelled errand for her father thrusts her from byline to unwitting subject in the very story she's trying to break. Adapted from Joan Didion's namesake novel.,Im usually not a look at my phone while watching a movie kind of person but from the beginning of there movie I found myself looking at my phone. Buy the time out was over I thought that maybe I missed a few key parts because I had no idea what the movie was all about. Came to see what others thought and I see that I didn't miss anything because others were just as confused as I was. This movie feels like they forgot to shoot some scenes that told more of the story. Maybe there's more answers in the book This was based off of.
"Pamela, a Love Story",2023,7.2,"Follows the life of pop culture icon Pamela Anderson, including never-before-seen archival footage and personal journals.","I think a lot of people out there can relate to her and her life. Not that they are famous etc, but the human stuff every human goes through. All the hardship, trauma, childhood, love, career and life etc.This documentary was really good, and better than I thought it would be.Pamela is such a sweetheart, she is such a lovely person. This was the first documentary that I had seen about her. I had no idea that she is this down-to-earth sweetheart.As she is telling her story and going through all the stuff that she went through, you can sense those emotions too. When she was telling the stories about her having fun, you felt joy watching this and when she told the dark stories of hardship, you felt sadness.I love that we got to see that soft side of her.100% I recommend you see this!"
The Out-Laws,2023,5.4,"A straight-laced bank manager about to marry the love of his life. When his bank is held up by infamous Ghost Bandits during his wedding week, he believes his future in-laws who just arrived in town, are the infamous Out-Laws.","I gave this comedy a chance because of the great casting with Pierce Brosnan, Ellen Barkin, Nina Dobrev and Michael Rooker, but even they couldn't save this mess. The chemistry between Dobrev and Devine wasn't convincing, mainly because Devine can't really act. Unless you're a fan of Adam Devine and Blake Anderson and their infantile humor in Workaholics, you probably will cringe and eyeroll your way through the lame comedy, which is pretty much spot on with the Workaholics series. It feels like a bunch of failed SNL sketches. The entire writing is cliched and predictable, and the directing does nothing to elevate the already irritating comedy and generic story. Had they cast someone actually funny, like a Kevin Hart, this would've been more enjoyable. If you're into snot-nose barf-up comedy, this may be for you, and all the pre-teens out there, but not for mentally stable and mature audiences. The bogus 10/10 reviews are funnier."
The Dukes of Hazzard,2005,5.1,"Cousins Bo, Luke, and Daisy Duke, and their uncle Jesse, egg on the authorities of Hazzard County, Boss Hogg and Sheriff Coltrane.","Jefferson Davis 'Boss' Hogg (Burt Reynolds) intends to make a fortune by strip-mining Hazzard Count for its coal, but when moonshiners Bo and Luke Duke (Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville) get wind of his nefarious plan, they decide to throw a spanner in the works, with a little help from Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson), cousin Daisy (Jessica Simpson), and Wonder Woman (Lynda Carter).I was never really a fan of the TV series of The Dukes of Hazzard, despite hailing from the South (of England, that is), so I'm not going to complain about this big screen adaptation crapping all over my childhood memories. I am, however, going to complain that the film lacks charm, a decent plot, memorable performances and any real sense of fun, director Jay Chandrasekhar merely going through the motions, delivering what he expects fans want to see, but doing so with seemingly little love, imagination or enthusiasm.Knoxville and Scott might get top billing as good ol' boys Bo and Luke, moonshine runners and general troublemakers of Hazzard County, but the real stars of the film are General Lee, their muscle car, which is involved in numerous silly chase scenes in which the vehicle continues to function despite preposterous chassis knackering jumps and crashes, and Jessica Simpson as delectable Daisy Duke, whose bodywork is absolutely stunning and who, I imagine, handles like a dream."
The Bubble,2022,4.7,A group of actors and actresses stuck inside a pandemic bubble at a hotel attempt to complete a film.,"Watched this film at Paris theater in NYC aka the Netflix Theater. Without spoiling much, I will just that this film is not very funny. Contrary, it's long, it's got too many characters, the storyline is very vague and confusing, and the jokes are not there. Judd Apatow was bragging about finishing the script in 8 weeks, and honestly it really felt so."
The Good Place,,8.2,"Eleanor Shellstrop, a deceased saleswoman who lived a morally corrupt life, finds herself in a heaven-like afterlife in a case of mistaken identity and tries to hide her past in order to stay there.","The Good Place isn't the best comedy show, but it might be the most creative and thought-provoking. It's very special."
Heart of Stone,2023,5.7,An intelligence operative for a shadowy global peacekeeping agency races to stop a hacker from stealing its most valuable and dangerous weapon.,"Like every other action film that Netflix release, this is a 5 at best. Another live action computer game, awful far fetched plot , terrible acting and nothing more than a 2 hour time filler at best. Whoever keeps commissioning films for Netflix needs to leave as it's the same drivel over and over again. 6 Underground, Red Notice blah blah blah, all the same glossy, style over substance rubbish. They must think that it's just teenage boys that watch Netflix as every so called action move is catered for them. I dread to think how much this cost but what a waste. A Waste of time and subscription."
Paradise,2023,6.3,"After his wife is forced to give up 40 years of her life as payment for an insurance debt, a man desperately searches for a way to get them back.","It's hard for me to understand how Netflix can allow complete amateurs write movie scripts.They do it again and again. How can this be a sustainable business model? Put 15 million dollars in a movie based on a script that any 16 years old could have written better.I mean look at this mess of a script. What is this? Apart from the premise, which is not completely new but interesting, it is just complete garbage. There are no character build ups, there is no interesting dramatic goal, there are not story steps, there isn't even a central conflict, it's just a huge chaos all over the place.None of the characters come even close to touching us. The antagonist has one single encounter with the hero, where they both say one sentence, no conflict. We never learn what motivates her.The hero saves a woman that doesn't wanna be saved. His wife. Well, it's said that she is his wife, but we never really come to believe it, as there is zero chemistry between them. They tell each other ""I love"" you three times in a car, but there is no feeling, it's worse than in a soap opera. Two sex scenes (hello Netflix) add nothing to the chemistry. The actress isn't very convincing, but it's not only her fault. Maybe the makers should have watched some love movies to learn how to establish a bond between a loving couple, especially as this is - or rather should have been - the central motivator of the hero, saving his wife's life.That's his mission. Unfortunately, she doesn't rally wanna be saved and seems to have given in to her fate. Then she changes her mind and wants to be saved. Then she changes her mind again, because it would mean to harm an innocent person. Then she changes her mind again and almost kills the innocent girl, sleeps with her husband, and finally decides to betray her husband and take the lifetime of the girl, and also break up with the guy who sacrificed his life for her and get pregnant from another guy that appeared out of nowhere (is this the new ""female empowerment""?). Frustrated, her now ex-husband joins the terrorist to kill some more people. Why? We never really learn.It's so bizarre, that it's almost funny. The script actually reminded me of Tommy Wiseau's 2003 film The Room, widely considered the worst film ever made. In this film the actor changes his mind sometimes twice within a scene.I wonder if the producers come to Netflix with a script so bad, or if the script is okay but Netflix ruins it with their developer team, because they want it to fit their algorithm or whatever.It's depressing, because the premise would have offered so much potential. For example, only the rich can afford the costly life-time transfer process, and they take it from the poor. Was that too political for Netflix? Why was this huge potential theme never harvested in the movie? Isn't that what's happening right now on this planet, that only the rich can afford top medical care?Well, but ignoring reality and promoting escapism seems to be the new thing on Netflix, so I guess the filmmakers ran into heavy resistance there. Sad.Netflix used to be cool, now it's more and more turning into a drug to numb down the oppressed workforce."
Oppenheimer,2023,8.3,"A dramatization of the life story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who had a large hand in the development of the atomic bombs that brought an end to World War II.","Reviewers say 'Oppenheimer' by Christopher Nolan is a complex biopic delving into J. Robert Oppenheimer's role in atomic bomb development. Themes of moral dilemmas, scientific responsibility, and nuclear impact are prominent. Cillian Murphy's performance, technical aspects, and historical accuracy receive praise. However, some find the pacing slow, narrative disjointed, and runtime excessive. Critics also note a lack of emotional depth and underdeveloped characters. Despite these issues, Nolan's direction, visual style, and thought-provoking nature are widely appreciated."
Drive,2011,7.8,A mysterious Hollywood action film stuntman gets in trouble with gangsters when he tries to help his neighbor's husband rob a pawn shop while serving as his getaway driver.,"After a summer of cheap thrills, Drive delivers thrills on the cheap. With a budget Michael Bay might have allocated for a single effects sequence in Transformers 3, Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn made one of the best movies of the year. Following Bronson and Valhalla Rising, Refn crafts his most polished, commercial work yet, while retaining all the ambiguity and unbridled aggression of his tough-as-nails art house pictures.Bearing thematic resemblance to Darren Aronofsky's recent output, Drive is like Black Swan in overdrive. The film pins its headlights on the dark implications of unchecked obsession and good intentions gone haywire. That dangerous duality ‚Äì humanity on the razor's edge of animal brutality ‚Äì is played to unnerving perfection by Ryan Gosling.Rightly among the most reliable names on the Hollywood marquee, the star of Drive plays a crucible of a character. A friendly, fatherly figure to his neighbor (Carey Mulligan) and her young son, he's decidedly less so when the two are threatened. A sort of oblique, ultraviolent superhero, the driver leaps to defend the innocent with bloody determination. If the first half of Drive plays as drama, the second is straight up revenge fare.Playing on the juxtaposition of calm and calamity, Refn keeps us on our toes throughout. Quiet moments stretch into suffocating silence, and the explosive violence that inevitably shatters it practically tears the frame in half. The audio is expertly mixed; you'll want to see Drive loud. From its roaring engines and visceral blows to its curt dialogue, the film is an altar to the power of great sound design.In truth, Drive isn't pervasively violent, though its most excruciatingly effective moments leave a memory trail like tire streaks on a sunbaked highway. At the heart of the story is a compelling, surprisingly tender romance. Carey Mulligan has proved herself a similarly reliable talent to Gosling, and has worked in recent years with the likes of Michael Mann, Oliver Stone, and Mark Romanek.Her fragile character's relationship with the driver is subtle and nuanced in a manner atypical of thriller convention. They're not family, they're not even sleeping together. Drive is not a sexy film. Refn fetishizes neither cars nor women; if The Fast and the Furious is the sleek exterior curves of an automobile, Drive is the greasy, undulating pistons. And it's utilitarian at a lean 100 minutes.The rest of the small cast also impresses. Albert Brooks plays against type as a cutthroat crime lord, and a note-perfect Ron Perlman plays his meathead partner. Bryan Cranston of TV's Breaking Bad has a small role too, as employer and confidant to Gosling's character. Their relationships shuffle as lines are drawn and redrawn, but none of them comes away unscathed by the film's end.Drive is either the explosive end to a lukewarm summer movie season or an early autumn adrenaline rush. In machismo, it far outpaces its hundred million dollar competition, leaving overwrought tales of lesser heroes like Thor and Green Lantern in the dust. Its troubled characters, and the bonds of desperation that link them, elevate the film above its genre trappings and shield it from disposable entertainment status.Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive is an anomaly. It's like a 1200 horsepower hybrid. And it's one of the best movies of 2011."
Bullet Train,2022,7.3,Five assassins aboard a swiftly-moving bullet train find out that their missions have something in common.,"This is a highly entertaining action-comedy that oozes style. It's extremely fun and a bit on the outrageous side, not meant to be taken too seriously. It's filled with funny and memorable moments. The action is awesome, well-shot and clear, which is no surprise coming from the guy who directed John Wick, Atomic Blonde and Deadpool 2.There are a ton of characters and I like them all. The cast does such a great job, especially Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. I remember first seeing Brian Tyree Henry in Atlanta and really enjoying that role. Since then, he has taken on vastly different roles and killed all of them. And I already thought Aaron Taylor-Johnson is a great actor, but the way he completely transforms into his character is remarkable. To the point where you don't see Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Literally. I didn't realize it was him until the credits rolled.If I had to come up with negatives, I would say it's a bit hectic at times, but not enough to take me out of it. And the story borders on being convoluted, but I was able to follow it all so I'll call it intricate instead.I had a great time with this movie and would definitely watch it again, although I'll be turning on subtitles since some dialogue is hard to understand in a Snatch kind of way.EDIT: On second viewing, my negatives disappeared. And a couple things that stood out even more: The music is beastly and Brad Pitt's facial expressions in the reaction shots are priceless.(3 viewings, early screening UltraScreen 8/2/2022, UltraScreen 8/17/2022, 8/6/2025)"
Kodachrome,2017,6.8,"Set during the final days of the admired photo development system known as Kodachrome, a father and son hit the road in order to reach the Kansas photo lab before it closes its doors for good.","How much does a movie's originality in terms of storyline play into it's ultimate, overall quality? Should a film be seen only in terms of the movies that have come before it?From it's title and poster to the actual film itself, Kodachrome sets itself up to be THAT kind of a road trip movie. The kind that features Hollywood jaw lines gazing into the setting sun as your quintessential bright red convertible speeds through a quiet countryside. This is accompanied with that melodious Indie track that rounds out the scene. Kodachrome is most definitely about something; it has meaning, it has purpose. The performances are affecting. The direction is largely unobtrusive and contents itself with letting the script do all the talking, exuding a tenderness that pervades and persists throughout the entire film.Yet, all of these accomplishments are left denied by the aforementioned screenplay which not only resorts to a fundamental premise that is unoriginal but dialogue that routinely divulges into the perceived cliches of the 'road trip' movie. Characters repeatedly break into melancholy monologues about love, life and art, making biting observations on the human condition. From afar, the plot unfurls predictably and there is nary a moment where the viewer is surprised. Also, as a movie where the narrative is driven by the praise for tradition film format and analog technology, and despite having been aptly shot in 35mm film, photography as an art form itself does not play a more central role in dictating the nature of the storytelling. Given it's narrative simplicity, the experience could have been unique if the origins and vitality of preserving the old art form were entwined into the story, serving as an effective case for the preservation of the film format.While these are my qualms with the movie, there is no denying that it is constructed with care and an eye for detail that could easily have been left out. The characters are fairly well realized through whom the movie commendably balances the humour with the drama. The performances manage to convey the gravity of the story and the simple confidence with which the movie progresses is sure to engage most viewers. Ultimately, Kodachrome stands as an undemanding, welcoming road trip movie; you won't feel new feelings, but you will revisit old ones, much the same way you might look at some personal Kodak photograph of old."
The Flash,2023,6.6,"Barry Allen uses his super speed to change the past, but his attempt to save his family creates a world without super heroes, forcing him to race for his life in order to save the future.","Reviewers say 'The Flash' offers strong performances, especially from Ezra Miller and Michael Keaton, and nostalgic fan service. Praised for humor, action sequences, and themes like time travel and multiverse, it entertains. However, subpar CGI and a convoluted, rushed plot receive criticism. Some find the story hard to follow, while others appreciate its simplicity. Overall, 'The Flash' is an entertaining yet flawed DC Universe addition with varied viewer enjoyment."
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,2023,5.9,"The film continues the story of teenage Billy Batson who, upon reciting the magic word ""SHAZAM!"", is transformed into his adult superhero alter ego, Shazam.","Reviewers say 'Shazam! Fury of the Gods' garners mixed reviews, highlighting a convoluted plot and underdeveloped villains. Critics point to an inconsistent tone, reliance on tired tropes, and slow pacing. However, the film is praised for its humor, charming characters, and impressive visual effects. Zachary Levi's performance as Shazam stands out, along with enjoyable family dynamics and heartwarming moments. Despite its flaws, the film's commitment to fun and self-awareness is appreciated."
The First Purge,2018,5.2,"America's third political party, the New Founding Fathers of America, comes to power and conducts an experiment: no laws for 12 hours on Staten Island. No one has to stay on the island, but $5,000 is given to anyone who does.","Reviewers say 'The First Purge' delves into class disparity, racial tension, and governmental manipulation, offering socio-political commentary. Many praise its deeper exploration of the Purge concept, though criticisms arise over its predictable plot and underdeveloped characters. The film's violence and gore are noted as excessive, and its handling of racial themes is controversial. Despite these issues, some view it as an improvement over prior films, appreciating its action sequences and character development attempts."
Sarah Silverman: Someone You Love,,6.2,"Follows New England native Sarah Silverman, showcasing her fearless chutzpah.","It had been a while since I made contact with any of Sarah's contents, but I was aware that she became much more political in the recent years while doing her podcast. I was kinda expecting that she would try and emphasize political points in this special... BUT NO, NOT AT ALL! Sarah delivers flawlessly joke after joke in the most inventive, unexpected and refreshingly childish ways; her essence hasn't changed a bit, It's only gotten better... Things are just a little bit different (but in a very good way): Her entire experience and maturity is displayed at all times. I did, in fact, laugh out loud with 80% of the jokes. Her body language has become one of her sharpest and funniest assets. I genuinely felt proud of her for assembling such course of ideas onto this special. I definitely say go for it. Great job, Sarah and her team!"
Worth,2020,6.8,"An attorney in Washington D.C. battles against cynicism, bureaucracy and politics to help the victims of 9/11.","It's set from 2001 to 2003 in Washington, D. C. and New York City and tells the story of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund through the eyes of its Special Master, Kenneth Feinberg. The movie is ""based on"" Feinberg's book, ""What is Life worth""?The movie opens by setting up Kenneth Feinberg's (Michael Keaton) bona fides as an expert on compensation for loss of life from a sudden loss of life by accident or violence. After 9/11, Feinberg, a longtime Democrat who had worked for Ted Kennedy, is asked by Attorney General John Ashcroft (Victor Slezak) to be the Special Master for the compensation fund. Feinberg welcomes the invitation, and with the help of his assistant, Camille Biros (Amy Ryan), and staffers Priya Khundi (Shunori Ramanathan) and Darryl Barnes (Ato Blankson-Wood), begins the process of meeting the claimants.Initially, Feinberg is an insensitive number-cruncher who alienates the relatives of those who lost family members. We hear snippets of many stories of victims and follow a few more extended stories. These include the gay partner of a victim who does not fit the ""formula"" because Virginia, where they lived, did not recognize civil unions. Another involved the widow and children of a firefighter who had other children the widow presumably did not know about. Other characters are critics of the Fund's rules, Charles Wolf (Stanley Tucci), and a lawyer representing only the highest-income families, Lee Quinn (Tate Donovan).The storyline follows Feinberg's transition to greater empathy and the challenge to get at least 80% of the claimants to sign on to the Fund by the deadline.At some levels, this is a heartwarming story of growing empathy. However, I wondered what the real Kenneth Feinberg thought of his depiction. In the beginning, he's a tone-deaf bureaucrat, which seems odd for someone reputed to be an expert in compensation cases that requires meetings with survivors. This rattled my believability gauge, which is always crucial for me in biopics. In addition, I found Keaton's ""Boston"" accent more distracting than reinforcing. And the ending surge to the finish line seemed a bit pat.But I found the story engaging and a good reminder of the chaos and myriad stories that emerged from 9/11."
School of Rock,2003,7.2,"After being kicked out of his rock band, Dewey Finn becomes a substitute teacher of an uptight elementary private school, only to try and turn his class into a rock band.","After being fired from his own band, the guitar player Dewey Finn (Jack Black) needs to raise some money to pay for his rent and his bills. When his friend and school teacher Ned Schneebly (Mike White) is called to a temporary work in an expensive private school, Dewey pretends to be Ned and accepts the job. He finds talented young musicians in his class, and he decides to form a rock-and-roll band with the students and win a competition called ""Battle of Bands"" to raise the prize and be recognized in the show business.""The School of Rock"" is a very funny and politically incorrect comedy tailored for Jack Black. He steals the movie and rocks in the role of a rock-and-roll lover, who dreams to be successful as a guitar player. Most of the lines belong to him, and I believe this movie is his best individual performance in his successful career. Joan Cusack is excellent as usual, and Miranda Cosgrove seems to have potential and be a great promise as actress. The soundtrack is a great homage to rock-and-roll, with many classics including Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"". The DVD is full of worthwhile Extras, and in the end this film is an excellent funny entertainment. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Escola de Rock"" (""School of Rock"")"
Twisted Metal,,7.3,An outsider must deliver a mysterious package across a post-apocalyptic wasteland in exchange for a better life.,"A fun romping stomping show, based on a videogame series (which I didn't know going into it) so was clueless as to what it was but with a good crew it was worth a try. I just finished binging all 10 episodes in one sitting, so this deserves a solid 9/10 from me.It had minimal downtime, basically a hoot to watch, and the actors did a great job, especially the character Sweet Tooth, voiced by Will Arnett while embodied by Joe Seanoa, a wwe wrestler wearing a clown mask. He easily stole every scene he was in.The cgi and action scenes could have been better, but you can't expect MCU 200 million dollar budget effects from a TV show based on a video game, so with the budget they had they did well enough that it didn't feel to o campy.Certainly recommend giving it a go."
The Covenant,2023,7.5,"During the war in Afghanistan, a local interpreter risks his own life to carry an injured sergeant across miles of grueling terrain.","I no idea how strongly Guy Ritchie genuinely feels about the grave wrongs that the US and UK military have done to interpreters in both Afghanistan and Iraq in recent conflicts but, if The Covenent is anything to go by, he's pretty pissed. And rightly so. The promises made to these individuals in an effort to get them to behave against the best interests of both them and their families needed to be honoured. In this story and in many real life cases, they weren't. That is shameful.Jake Gyllenhaal is his usual reliable self, turning in a performance dripping in both commitment and duty. He's a good man and he's gonna do the right thing, no matter how far that necessitates he goes. Dar Salim - a new name to me - is an utter revelation as Ahmed, the bitter but pragmatic interpreter who puts his life on the line countless times to...yes, do the right thing.The impact that war and each other have on these men's lives is at the very heart of this story. Though not based on any real incident to the best of my knowledge, this movie is testament to many real life situations that I have no doubt still keep men awake at night. It's an important movie and almost certainly a career high for all involved."
Love at First Sight,2023,6.8,"Two strangers connect on a flight to London, only to be separated by a twist of fate. A reunion seems improbable, but love has a way of defying the odds.","Just a sweet, well made rom com. I haven't seen anything like this in a while. I tend to watch a lot edgier films. But every once in a while it's a nice break to watch something that's a bit on the predictable side.I thought the acting was above average. I especially like the fact the the female lead wasn't over the top beautiful. She was charming and had a girl-nextt-door quality. I'm a guy so I couldn't tell you if the male lead was handsome or not. But overall, I thought all the stars were quite good.If you're in the mood for something that's fairly predictable, give this one a shot. You won't be disappointed."
The Tomorrow War,2021,6.6,A family man travels to the year 2051 to join a global war against a deadly alien species.,"Reviewers say 'The Tomorrow War' is an entertaining sci-fi action film with impressive CGI and strong performances, especially from Chris Pratt and JK Simmons. However, critics note plot holes, clich√©s, and a lack of originality. Described as a fun, popcorn-style movie, it has flaws like sentimentality, predictable twists, and a lengthy runtime. Despite mixed opinions, it serves as a decent summer blockbuster for escapist entertainment."
Magyar√°zat mindenre,2023,7.3,"Abel is a high school student struggling to focus on his final exams, while being hopelessly in love with his best friend Janka.","Although the synopsis emphasizes the love story, the film is mostly about the problems of a divided society and how a small mishap goes a long way when it gets political. All this is beautifully embedded in a school-leaving story about love, exams and family relations. The story is very Hungarian, but it can be equally interesting for international audiences, especially for those where political divisions are taking a toll on all parts of society.The film was made with a very low budget, practically no funding, but the brilliant acting and the captivating story really makes you forget about this fact. Definitely recommended (just as the previous two films of G√°bor Reisz)."
Whitney Cummings: Can I Touch It?,,6.5,"In her fourth stand-up special, Whitney Cummings returns to her hometown of Washington, D.C., and riffs on modern feminism, relationships, technology and, of course, sex robots. She also brings a very special guest to say hi.","I am really big fan of Whitney and I really couldn't wait to watch this show, but it was really boring. I couldn't believe that someone funny like her is telling so stupid jokes. I hope next one is better."
The Tick,,7.4,"In a world where superheroes have been real for decades, an accountant with no superpowers comes to realize his city is owned by a super villain. As he struggles to uncover this conspiracy, he falls in league with a strange blue superhero.","Reviewers say 'The Tick' is lauded for its humor, character development, and nostalgic elements, with standout performances by Peter Serafinowicz and Griffin Newman. However, some criticize the darker tone, departure from campy humor, and early episode pacing. Foul language and a less likable Arthur also draw ire. Despite these issues, many find the series enjoyable for its comedy-action blend."
House of Cards,,8.6,A Congressman works with his equally conniving wife to exact revenge on the people who betrayed him.,"Reviewers say 'House of Cards' is acclaimed for its gripping political drama, exceptional acting, especially Kevin Spacey's Frank Underwood, and innovative storytelling. The series is lauded for sharp writing, engaging plot, and complex characters. However, criticisms arise regarding quality decline post-Spacey, with Season 6 notably panned. Some express disappointment in political commentary and perceived bias. Despite these issues, 'House of Cards' remains influential in the political drama genre."
Meg 2: The Trench,2023,5.0,"A research team's journey into the depths of the ocean turns into chaos when a mining operation forces them into a battle for survival, facing off against Megalodons and relentless environmental marauders.","Personally, I was surprised that Jason Statham decided to make a sequel to the Meg. Most likely because I did not think the Meg was his type of movie. Not exactly Crank on water or anything. The film is an obvious cash cow but worth the money. No need to put any thought into how stupid this movie its cause it's met to be the opposite of smart. Its entertaining as hell and does not slow down long enough for me to point out the plot holes and the science mistakes. A perfect Tie-in to Shark Week. I went into this baby knowing that I was going to like it and I came out loving every minute of it. It's not met to be Shakespeare but it's definitely a fun experience."
The Subtle Art of Not Giving a #@%!,2023,5.9,"The film will explore society's obsessions with the pursuit of happiness and will be presented by Mark Manson alongside Disappointment Panda, a character from the book whose superpower is to tell people the harsh truth.","Manson tries to convey to us practical wisdom from his life and the modern era that is controversial and confusing.His narrative is one of first world drama where he discovers himself. It's okay, but not very well thought out or scientifically backed. I think one would do much better watching an Alain de Botton TED Talk.True some ideas are better placed in a motion picture narrative. Here the Director has used a mixture of 1980s BBC clips and B-grade acting scenes. It just hasn't cut the mustard for this critical reviewer.For a better experience I'd suggest 'Ravi Patel's Pursuit of Happiness' (2020)"
Infinite Storm,2022,5.3,"When a climber gets caught in a blizzard, she encounters a stranded stranger and must get them both down the mountain before nightfall.",The story had a lot of potential. I get the theme of the story. But the pace was too slow and not much happens in the story. It was difficult staying focused and keeping my attention which considering I like slow burn movies means even this was too slow for me. I think another reviewer said it best that it needs more content in the story. Naomi Watts is a great actress and that has never been in doubt. But even she couldn't rescue this film.
Shaq,,7.7,It showcases the life of the Lakers champion O'Neal from sports phenom to cultural figure.,"Director Robert Alexander and producer Peter Berg offer the latest glimpse into the career of the basketball star, the rise of the second Lakers dynasty and more.Because nobody paused and said, ""Do we really need this?"" there must have been a two- or three-month period in which they were sitting down with a different documentary crew every other day to retell the same stories about the Showtime Lakers, the Buss family and the transition from the '80s Lakers dynasty into the '90s Lakers dynasty led by Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.A purely practical level - and I'm a practical guy - the four-part Shaq is completely unnecessary. The second and third episodes of Shaq recount the same Lakers saga covered in the middle episodes of Legacy, but with fewer voices and much less candor and depth. Most of the first episode is dedicated to the early chapters of Shaquille O'Neal's life and his tenure with the Orlando Magic, previously chronicled in the middle-tier ESPN 30 for 30 film This Magic Moment.Only the fourth episode, from his trade to the Heat to his current tenure as a television talking head and relentless commercial pitchman, is ""new"" and features some of the more emotional elements in the series. But it covers 18 years of terrain in 45 rushed minutes, and its ""Hey, Shaq became a businessman!"" revelations are near-identical, by design, to the similar chapter in They Call Me Magic. Anyway, it's not like Shaquille."
Hidden Strike,2023,5.4,"Two ex-special forces soldiers must escort a group of civilians along Baghdad's ""Highway of Death"" to the safety of the Green Zone.","80' style plot? Check. Schlocky dialog? Check. Bad CGI? Check. World's greatest martial artist showing he still has it? Check. Pro wrestler-slash-action star whipping up on the bad guys? Check. It was cheesy and campy and I liked it! Expecting a thought provoking thriller? Go see a Christopher Nolan film. Want a Friday night popcorn / check brain at door movie that's just fun to watch? Stop browsing what's new to stream and enjoy this guilty pleasure. Jackie Chan and John Cena have some surprisingly good and funny chemistry. Much better than I expected, but then I didn't have super high expectations. Glad I didn't, because this film delivered."
Mortal Engines,2018,6.1,"In a post-apocalyptic world where cities ride on wheels and consume each other to survive, two people meet in London and try to stop a conspiracy.","I enjoyed this movie mostly for the novel concept. Something really upsetting has happened to the Earth, there is some mention of a 60-minute war, perhaps nuclear. Now, at least 1000 years into the future, or as one character says, 1700 years after the big destruction, cities large and small are on very, very large traction devices, they travel the landscape and gobble up smaller cities for the food and supplies. The featured city is London with its many levels, the lowest for grunt work and the highest for the elite.So the hook here isn't unlike many other fantasy movies, there is always one powerful man who wants to be all-powerful. And there are one or two ordinary people who need to stop him. Here it is a female and a male, 30-ish young adults.The movie is loaded with action, especially the last third or so. It is entertaining as a futuristic action flick, I suppose one could draw parables about the human condition and caring for each other. I watched it on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped.The disc has a number of very interesting extras showing how they built the sets and made certain parts of the movie."
Best. Christmas. Ever!,2023,4.4,Friendships are put to the ultimate test over a boastful holiday newsletter.,"Pinche Netflix you got me good on this one. The plot is caca. I still do not understand why I actually watched the whole thing. I guess i so bad that you keep on watching waiting on something to happen. And it kinda does, but holly cow, I'm still trying to figure out what in the world I watched. Starts decently, I digged the set up of the story and the characters but, really? And truste me, Im a very easy customer when it comes to consuming entertainment, but this movie is ridiculous. Please Netflix: I need back my hour and twenty minutes I spent watching this movie, plus the time i spent looking for something to watch."
What's Your Number?,2011,6.1,A woman looks back at the past nineteen men she's had relationships with in her life and wonders if one of them might be her one true love.,"For a typical romantic comedy, ""What's Your Number"" sort of surprised me, as it was just a tad more than your average movie of this sort.What initially made me watch it was Anna Faris (playing Ally), because she usually makes funny comedies, and I have always found her acting to be enjoyable, and her selection of characters is usually great as well. Her performance in ""What's Your Number"", however, wasn't her best performance in her career, in my opinion. It wasn't bad either, it was just that she are better off in straight comedies in my opinion, not these romantic comedies. But hey, we all have different likes and dislikes.Working with Farris was Chris Evans (playing Collin), whom I can't claim to be a big fan of. I think I have only seen him in the previous couple of superhero movies that he did. And I think he was better cut out for action movies of that sort compared to the romantic comedies. I will say that Farris and Evans did have a certain good amount of on-screen chemistry that worked out well enough.As for the story in ""What's Your Number"", well it is basically your average standard run-of-the-mill plot line here. An unlikely couple starting out as strangers, then eventually becoming closer and closer, until they realize that the right one was right there in front of them all along. So nothing new to be seen here in that department. The plot did thicken with the layer added when the story was given the part with how many sexual partners does a woman have in her lifetime. That aspect was kind of fun and did add some pretty awkward situations here and there.For a comedy, there wasn't all that many laughs throughout this movie. The best scene, and the best laugh (for me), was the very last phone call that Ally got while they were in the apartment. That cracked me up.""What's Your Number"" isn't a boring movie, and it does have some more substance compared to other romantic comedies. However, I think you have to be a woman to fully appreciate this movie. As a guy, I can now say that I have seen it, and it is doubtful that I will be putting the movie on a second time, unless wifey wants to watch it again."
Lost in Space,1998,5.2,The Robinson family was going into space to fight for a chance for humanity. Now they are fighting to live long enough to find a way home.,"I watched Lost In Space recently after not having seen it in a while, and felt the desire to post a quick review of this movie.When it came out, it seemed that everyone wanted to jump on the bandwagon of panning this movie. It seems people felt that the acting was not up to par, the script was almost laughable, the FX shots were cheesy and this was just generally a bad movie.They didn't get it.I would never have considered myself a fan of the original TV series, though I do remember in my teens watching it on British TV on a Sunday afternoon when there was little else to do, often with lunch. Let's be honest here; it was hokey, campy and its relationship to ""science fiction"" as a genre started and stopped at the spacecraft and the robot. The rest was filler. Given that though, the original pilot was actually pretty dark; obviously a failed attempt at a very serious TV series that was degenerated to a comedy by the public impression that Irwin Allen could not produce a serious show.And so we come to the movie. If you go into this expecting a campy sci-fi series bought up to date you'll be disappointed. Similarly if you go in expecting a serious movie more along the lines of the original pilot you'll also be disappointed. However, if all you want is to be entertained for two hours and not think too hard about the science, this is about as good as a typical summer blockbuster gets. It's a comic-book rendition of the concepts laid out in the pilot, and it shows.While the script is sometimes a little ""off"", the well established actors such as Mimi Rogers, Gary Oldman and William Hurt chew up the material and create a charged and enjoyable atmosphere. Gary Oldman especially whips out yet another character who's intelligent, thoughtful and utterly evil. A comic-book stereotype if ever there was one and I can't think of anyone else who could've pulled it off quite so well.Although the pacing trips a couple of times throughout the movie, the story generally moves along at a rapid and enjoyable clip. Don't expect good science from this; there isn't much here for the real science geek... but while the science may not be perfect it's at least not so glaringly and annoyingly wrong as in Armageddon for example which I can't sit and enjoy due to the stunningly bad science especially in ""Act Two"" of that movie (right after takeoff).I truly feel that this movie could've been the start of a reasonably enjoyable franchise, but there were too many people who were ready to pan it because it wasn't what they expected. Granted, the trailers probably had much to do with that since they either made the movie out to be a campy takeoff of the TV show, or a serious Sci-Fi movie. This is neither, but put in perspective of being a comic book in and of itself, this is actually a highly enjoyable movie for anyone who just enjoys the pleasure of being told an engaging and enjoyable story.I doubt there will ever be a sequel to this movie for all the reasons I detailed above; for a start the actors are getting older and are no longer the people as portrayed in this movie, the children especially. However, if there were ever a sequel then I know I would be first in line at the theatre to see it. Yes, I enjoyed it that much.On that note, I usually find children in movies distracting and detracting from the rest of the movie. However, Lacey Chabert and and Jack Johnson do a wonderful job of being both fun to watch and a believable pair of siblings who mask their true affection for each other in barbs and insults... I know, I have younger siblings as well!Take a chance; sit down with some popcorn and someone you love... if you have kids then there's nothing here that will really negatively affect them either. Let the world melt away and just enjoy this movie as it was meant to be enjoyed; as a comic-book bought to life. You might find it better than many other movies that tried the same formula."
Warcraft: The Beginning,2016,6.7,"As an Orc horde invades the planet Azeroth using a magic portal, a few human heroes and dissenting Orcs must attempt to stop the true evil behind this war.","There were several constraints that the movie had to work with. There was the already established Warcraft mythos and stories, there was the terrible stigma of game adaptations and finally there was the matter of so many main CGI characters that had to look realistic, not like something Pixar or Disney designed. Given that, I was not expecting much.Yet the movie exceeded all my expectations and gave me hope for the future. The story is something placed at the end of chapter III of the mythos and the beginning of chapter IV. In game, it is the story of Warcraft I, which was another bold move, considering the hordes (heh heh heh) of World of Warcraft players that weren't even born when that game was published. It pits the peaceful kingdom of Azeroth vs the war clans of the unknown Orc, fleeing from their dying world through a portal fueled by the very thing that destroyed it. A half human, half orc girl is instrumental in providing information about who the Orcs are, what they want and how they have reached the kingdom.Characters were well developed, graphics were good, the script had few holes and the mature story was clearly well smoothed out. The only problem one could have is that it's just the first part in many, with the main conflict point resolved, but none for the character story lines.Actors came from all kinds of TV series, Vikings, Preacher and Legends of Tomorrow to name a few. The only predominantly big screen actor out there was Ben Foster. It shows both the direction of cinema and TV blending together (and perhaps with games) and the fear of well established cinema actors getting caught in unsuccessful game adaptations. Perhaps with the success of this and - one may only hope - Assassin's Creed, things will begin to change."
65,2023,5.4,An astronaut crash lands on a mysterious planet only to discover he's not alone.,"I DUNNO!This is a decent film in my opinion. I give it a 6.5 stars.A transportation pilot carrying passengers suspended in a cryogenic sleep finds himself stranded on an unknown planet after colliding with debris from an uncharted asteroid belt. Only he and a child survive the crash but they are miles from their only escape pod and they aren't alone.Adam Driver gave a good performance, the story was interesting and the special effects were good. I'm not much of a sci-fi buff but the tech and weaponry created for the film were good too.Admittedly, the film could have had a faster pace and more action. I think if it fails anywhere that would be my complaint but it was a decent film regardless.I don't really understand all the hate but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. It may not be for everyone I suppose but I know that I'll likely watch this again at some point."
Knights of the Zodiac,2023,4.4,"When a goddess of war reincarnates in the body of a young girl, street orphan Seiya discovers that he is destined to protect her and save the world. But only if he can face his own past and become a Knight of the Zodiac.","What do I mean by underproduced?There is no overarching set of quality control for acting skills, special effects, and it makes the movie neigh unwatchable after awhile.Want to be an indie film? Hire hungry actors and go cheap on effects. Want to be a blockbuster? Hire A-listers and splurge on effects.This film is jarringly uneven in quality and even though some of the newly faced actors seem to be bent to pour their hearts into their lines and action sequences, others obviously seem to be there just for the check.This movie would have been better if it had been run a budget 1/10th the size with actors who actually wanted to do their jobs."
Emily,2022,6.8,"""Emily"" imagines the transformative, exhilarating, and uplifting journey to womanhood of a rebel and a misfit, one of the world's most famous, enigmatic, and provocative writers, who died, too soon, at age 30.","Emily is a real shame as it is a film that had some great promise but failed to engage me.This is largely because I felt like I was never actually let behind the curtain, and was kept at a frustrating distance from the characters. I never got under the skin of Emily, or any of the Bronte's really, and left the film with far more questions than answers. For a biopic, even a highly embellished one, this is unforgivable.Given what the film was trying to achieve and the angle it took, I was surprised by how little emotion was stirred in me. I wanted to feel more watching this film but just never felt like I was part of it.This lack of connection and emotion wasn't helped by the fact that the colour palette (whilst appropriate) was very bleak, the runtime was quite unforgiving, and the acting was rarely noteworthy.Unfortunately all this adds up to create an unremarkable film about a remarkable woman. Which in itself is an impressive feat I suppose."
Pain Hustlers,2023,6.6,"Liza dreams of a better life for herself and her daughter. Hired to work for a bankrupt pharmaceutical company, Liza skyrockets with sales and into the high life, putting her in the middle of a federal criminal conspiracy.","First off, it's not like the pain killer shows from Netflix and Hulu, different drug. Secondly, I don't understand why people are hating on the movie. Story line is great, acting is great and it's an interesting story based on true events. Not sure what else you really need in a film to make it at a bare minimum enjoyable.Saw a review said ""it's not cool for a kid to start a forest fire."" As that statement is true, the movie didn't make it cool n it's literally 7seconds of the film. Or someone else was comparing it to a Scorsese film? Lol I guess having music and interesting story makes that true? People are so sensitive and just can't enjoy a movie."
Playing It Cool,2014,5.9,Unrequited love motivates a guy to write about his experiences.,"Rom-Coms are not the easiest to make. If you try to make a real good one that is. But even the ""bad"" ones make their money back mostly. And I wouldn't categorize this as a bad one. Does it have some misplaced dialog and some clich√©s in it? Yes, though it's not the first one to do so and its lead actors are charming enough for you to not care too much about that.While the inevitable outcome is predictable, there may be a few obstacles along the way that are kind of refreshing to see. And while our main protagonist could easily slip into unlikeable territory, Chris Evans is there to save him from that fate. No pun intended, for a decent effort. Nothing more, but certainly nothing less either"
Family Switch,2023,5.7,"When a chance encounter with an astrological reader causes the Walkers to wake up to a full body switch, can they unite to land a promotion, college interview, record deal, and soccer tryout?",Yes we have seen the concept of intergenerational body swaps innumerable times. Yes there are the usual tropes. Yes it can be silly.But this movie is actually infused with the spirit of Christmas.We teared. We laughed. We smiled. We nodded knowingly. We laughed hysterically. We felt warm and happy at the end of it.All the leads were good but I found Jennifer Garner and Emma Myers particularly good. Ms. Garner really showed her comic skills.This will not make best picture but it will make my annual list of Christmas movies. After all if you can't get sentimental or mawkish at Christmas then when?
Leave the World Behind,2023,6.4,"A family's getaway to a luxurious rental home takes an ominous turn when a cyberattack knocks out their devices, and two strangers appear at their door.","Reviewers say 'Leave the World Behind' delivers a suspenseful experience with standout performances from Julia Roberts and Mahershala Ali, and striking cinematography. The film's examination of societal themes, like technology dependence and racial tensions, is highlighted, though some find these elements overly pronounced. The ending sparks debate; some commend its ambiguity and realism, while others deem it unsatisfying and abrupt. Despite varied opinions, the film's tension and atmosphere are widely appreciated, making it a compelling, thought-provoking watch."
Best Sellers,2021,6.2,"A cranky, retired author reluctantly embarks on a final book tour to help out a young publisher.","Lucy Stanbridge (Aubrey Plaza) is struggling to maintain her book publishing father's legacy. Her books are being skewered by critics and Jack Sinclair (Scott Speedman) is trying to buy her out. She and her assistant Rachel Spence (Ellen Wong) discover an old contract with legendary writer Harris Shaw (Michael Caine). Harris wrote a groundbreaking blockbuster with her father but nothing more. In the contract, he owes the company one more book and she forces the sickly drunken writer to do a book tour.The first half is trying to be a slightly comedic road trip with Plaza doing Plaza. It's a bit uneven and clunky. It's not until Aubrey throws up into the bowl that the movie finds its heart. The second half is much better for it. I'm not sure if this is a realistic book publishing world but at least, the movie is trying. One does need to stick with this movie for awhile before it gets good."
You People,2023,5.5,"Follows a new couple and their families, who find themselves examining modern love and family dynamics amidst clashing cultures, societal expectations and generational differences.","It's been some time that I've been so bewildered and frustrated watching a film.This very talented cast is absolutely wasted on a terrible script filled with inane and outdated jokes. It's 2023, I think we've moved beyond the ridiculous viewpoints and stereotypes displayed in this film. The characters behave in such ridiculous ways. Eddie Murphy suddenly just decides to stop being a racist piece of crap and Julia Louis-Dreyfus has an awakening about how to speak to black people normally. It's all just so freaking annoying to watch.Hill and London also have net zero chemistry between them, which funny enough, really tends to tank a romantic comedy."
Happiness for Beginners,2023,6.1,"Helen signs up for a wilderness survival course, a year after getting divorced. She discovers through this experience that sometimes, you have to get really lost in order to find yourself.","This is a feel-good movie with a throwback feel, one in which the writers aren't trying to shock or offend you, or bombard you with whatever the latest work lesson is from the perpetually-offended or pretend-to-be offended calvary.This movie is the rare family-friendly movie that will appeal to most ages regardless of background or culture. It employs universal themes of self love, childhood crushes, second chances, finding hope again, etc. It just gives you that tingly feeling in your stomach, the kind that makes you glad or at least not perturbed that you spent a couple hours watching this random flick.Recommended for anyone who just wants an easy, feel-good experience. I think the movie did what it set out to do, nothing more, nothing less."
Anna Nicole Smith: You Don't Know Me,2023,6.4,"The story of Anna Nicole Smith, featuring never-before-seen footage of the iconic Playboy and Guess? jeans model who blazed a trail through the '90s before her tragic death at age 39.","I remember Anna Nicole Smith from my childhood and she was really beautiful, almost in every magazine i was seeing her. She was really really famous. In this documentary i felt so sad about her. Story is so classic actually. Poor beautiful girl with some teenage problem and becoming a star immediately and after that unavoidable fact happens... Anna Nicole Smith lived fast and died young. Maybe she did choose this ending.so sad really sad.. I hope she is in better place anymore. I am happy to watch this documentary, in last years i really love Netflix documentaries. This is one of the best again. Watchable, recommended. Do not listen negative comments."
Blue Beetle,2023,5.9,"An alien scarab chooses Jaime Reyes to be its symbiotic host, bestowing the recent college graduate with a suit of armor that's capable of extraordinary powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes the superhero known as Blue Beetle.","DCEU's 2023 has been at a dipping point. With the disappointment of Shazam! Fury of the Gods, in which the first one I really loved, and the somewhat decent of a Flash movie, it seems like the way the franchise is ending doesn't seem like a bang. Fortunately, Blue Beetle has already come out oh boy did it not disappoint.Now let me preface this: it is by no means a classic nor is it groundbreaking in the superhero genre. At the end of the day, I just want to have a good time in the theaters and, for the most part, it succeeds in what I'm aiming for: a fun time.Xolo Maridue√±a as the titular young Iron Man-like superhero, alter-ego Jaime Reyes, was really good. He brings a lot of energy to his performance filled with charisma, awkwardness and relatability because of his love for his family.Speaking of family, everyone was really good playing in their respective roles but George Lopez was easily the standout because of how funny his lines and reactions are towards Jaime.And the theme of the family is really at the center of Blue Beetle, it's really hard not to ignore it which is similar to Shazam. But as the film moves on, it does feel like everything that was done to make this possible was filled with heart by the filmmakers and knew just to be simply entertaining, hitting at all the right beats to make you laugh and cry.The pacing was surprisingly good as to how they were able to fill in the runtime which doesn't make it feel like two hours at all as you are watching it. It's like it took two to three days in the story, if you look at the second to the third act. That was really impressive.Visuals are great and the action sequences are really good to look at. Props to the director of photography, who by the way did Hereditary and Midsommar - yeah, let that sink in.Of course, the film is not without its faults. It is cheesy at times, does feel generic and doesn't seem like it wants to outshine the rest of the films not just in DC but everything superhero in general. But my personal issue would have to be how they handled Susan Sarandoncs character and the nemesis of Jaime. While I get where they are going, it felt like it needed to be more compelling and not just some cartoony villains.But by the end, I walked out of Blue Beetle thinking how good it was to see an enjoyable film with the message of family that hit me emotionally. Would I recommend the movie? Yes."
Desperados,2020,5.2,"A panicked young woman, with her reluctant friends in tow, rushes to Mexico to try and delete a ranting email she sent to her new boyfriend.","Not completely awful, a few humorous scenes and good cinematography, but on the whole unfunny. The jokes land painfully flat, leaving this movie very one note and lacking purpose. The storyline is very cliche and the main characters have no chemistry."
Irresistible,2020,6.3,"A Democratic strategist helps a retired veteran run for mayor in a small, conservative Midwest town.","This is a very interesting film about the behind the scenes of American politics. It is engaging, funny and witty all at the same time. I enjoyed it."
Living with Yourself,,7.1,"An existential comedy about a man struggling in life who undergoes a new treatment to become a better person, only to find that he's been replaced by a new and improved version of himself.","Paul Rudd has already proven to be an extraordinary actor, both in comedy and drama, So Hearing that there was a show coming out with Paul Rudd as two characters was already exciting. But actually watching the show and seeing it pay off is even better, I think they have done a great job at having a dramatic show, with goofy and funny ideas. The tone feels right and each episode is intriguing on its own. Not to mention the incredibly smooth effects they use make it seem like Paul Rudd is two different people. Good job Netflix, more of this please"
Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire,2023,5.6,"When a peaceful settlement on the edge of a distant moon finds itself threatened by a tyrannical ruling force, a stranger living among its villagers becomes their best hope for survival.","What's worse than a movie that shamelessly plagiarizes elements from other sci-fi or fantasy products? A movie that does all this and fails to even build a world in which you feel interest and curiosity in finding out how the story will evolve. However, if the terrible world-building is Rebel Moon's biggest flaw, it certainly cannot be said that everything else is able to compensate for the extremely poor script. Direction, visual effects, photography, costumes are all so aseptic and unmemorable that it is guaranteed that nothing of this movie will remain forged in people's minds for years to come, as movies and TV series have been able to do like which Rebel Moon would pretentiously love to place itself."
Barbie,2023,6.8,"Barbie and Ken are having the time of their lives in the seemingly perfect world of Barbie Land. However, when they get a chance to go to the outside world, they soon discover the joys and perils of living among regular humans.","Reviewers say 'Barbie' delves into gender roles, feminism, and self-discovery with a satirical approach, contrasting Barbieland with real-world complexities. The film tackles societal expectations and inequalities, though some find its messaging heavy-handed. Central themes include Barbie and Ken's relationship and identity exploration. Despite mixed reactions, the vibrant production design and performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are widely acclaimed."
Uncut Gems,2019,7.4,"With his debts mounting and angry collectors closing in, a fast-talking New York City jeweler risks everything in hope of staying afloat and alive.","All reviews here are correct. The good ones and the bad ones. This movie is a mess and you can like it or hate. My wife hated it, I liked it very much."
Chris Rock: Selective Outrage,,6.8,"Comedian Chris Rock performs a live stand-up special in Baltimore, Maryland.","I think his best and funniest work since ""Bigger and Blacker"". While many probably tuned in to hear his take on the Will Smith Oscar's slap, the special is so much more than that. It is cutting edge, smart, and funny. He talks about the state of woeness and raising kids, and he does end with his very vitriolic and funny account of the slap heard around the world. I have found many of Chris Rock's specials in the last years to be very inconsistent. They are filled with some very funny moments, but not enough to make the special great. Not tru of this one. It is a tight, funny, and thought provoking 70 minutes of comedy. I applaud him for his honesty and his sense of humor."
No Hard Feelings,2023,6.3,"On the brink of losing her home, Maddie finds an intriguing job listing: helicopter parents looking for someone to bring their introverted 19-year-old son out of his shell before college. She has one summer to make him a man or die trying.","Bit surprised at the low score on Imdb, as I would give this a solid 7.5/10This is a really well acted romcom, Lawrence and Feldman add chemistry and depth,to what would otherwise, be a rather thin story.If you like a romcoms like Pretty Woman, Notting Hill etc, this is for you.No hard feelings, has a consistent pace and feel.It may not be the best romcom ever made but, it's certainly good entertainment with it's own charm.What I would call a nice Sunday matinee film .Not much else to say but have to make up the required quota of characters.Would I watch it again, yes, I think I would give it another viewing.."
Oxygen,2021,6.5,"A woman wakes in a cryogenic chamber with no recollection of how she got there. As she's running out of oxygen, she must rebuild her memory to find a way out of her nightmare.","I went in to this film knowing nothing about it and that's probably the best way to watch it. There is nothing new in Oxygene, most of it rethreads old ground but as it's story unfolds it remains engaging from start to finished. This is greatly helped by Melanie Laurent's fantastic central performance. Pretty good story, lovely visuals and score and, as I said previously, a great central performance elevate what could have been mediocre fare to some decent sci-fi with a nice emotional payoff. Well worth your time."
Dumplin',2018,6.5,"Willowdean (""Dumplin'""), the plus-size teenage daughter of a former beauty queen, signs up for her mom's Miss Teen Bluebonnet pageant as a protest that escalates when other contestants follow her footsteps, revolutionizing the pageant and their small Texas town.","Dolly Parton's wonderful songs (and her distinct voice) are the highlight of this film. That said, ""Dumplin'"" film feels like a low-risk, tv special, played at 8 pm. The script is overly-sentimental, and while the themes are worthy, the delivery felt flat.Several characters who deserved to be fleshed out got the short-shrift. I'd like to see a more layered narrative of the lives of drag queens, apart from their entertainment value, but this film missed the mark. Even ""Bo"", the teenage hunk was reduced to a cardboard figure, imbued with cliched sound bites. Kathy Najimy (a fine actor) was given a perfunctory role, filled with animated actions.If you want to see Aniston deliver a riveting portrayal, see the film ""CAKE"". Sadly, she is not believable in this role. Although ""Patti Cake$ was not a great film, I enjoyed the performance of MacDonald more in that project. While ""Dumplin"" was not altogether terrible (most of the actors gave it their best), the script is in sore need of refinement and enriched characterizations."
The Killer,2023,6.7,"Solitary, cold, methodical and unencumbered by scruples or regrets, a killer waits in the shadows, watching for his next target. Yet, the longer he waits, the more he thinks he's losing his mind, if not his cool.","Nothing new here that's the disappointing part, great directors often give us high expectations given their former work but not all their movies are masterpieces and I guess that's all right.. Some are more consistent than others of course, but long story short this is a regular hitman movie, with great cinematography and direction and a great lead.It's not that the movie is bad, everything looks good, I didn't mind the approach to the story, the fact that it is a monologue from the main character and you navigate the story he tells is all right - it's well acted and directed which is what kept me interested but other than that is average at best...
The dialogue seems a bit forced, while trying to convey these pseudo life lessons it feels like I am looking at quotes on Facebook and the plot couldn't be more basic...Overall it's an okay movie, its style and production are great and Fassbender delivers as expected, but it's not enough to make it memorable or compelling.It seems after all these years Netflix keeps its formula of enlisting a famous actor for a an average movie to keep their subscriptions going."
The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent,2022,7.0,Movie star Nick Cage must channel his iconic screen characters when he finds himself caught in-between a dangerous super-fan and a CIA agent.,"Nic Cage plays a fictionalized version of himself in an enjoyable action-comedy that also stars a brilliant Pedro Pascal. Writers Tom Gormican and Kevin Etten strike a solid balance between fanboy moments and telling a fairly engaging story. While Cage excels in his dialogue-based humor, Pedro Pascal (who gets nearly equal emotional footing in the story) plays perfect foil to him. The underlying kidnapping plot is something that typically works in a Nic Cage action film, though Cage playing (a version of) himself makes all the difference here. The Easter eggs are organically placed, and the beautiful Spanish locales and production design present themselves as positives. The supporting cast also pitch in when needed, but Cage and Pascal do most of the heavy-lifting from a dramatic and comedic standpoint."
The Kitchen,2023,4.8,"In a dystopian future London where all social housing has been eliminated, Izi and Benji fight to navigate the world as residents of The Kitchen, a community that refuses to abandon their home.","How frustrating was this! It had potential but it couldn't decide what it was. If you want to produce a character led drama, then invest in your script and your actors. It ain't no ''Children of Men'.It didn't move me, nor excite me with anything. It just kept teasing me with what could have been. The characters were obvious and lack less, but that's not saying the performances weren't adequate. If only they were given more to work with.It's a shame as Channel 4 has given us, over the years, some amazing films but I'm afraid, this lacked the grittiness of past productions. Nice idea, shame about the script and direction."
The King of Staten Island,2020,7.1,Scott has been a case of arrested development since his firefighter dad died. He spends his days smoking weed and dreaming of being a tattoo artist until events force him to grapple with his grief and take his first steps forward in life.,"Which I am, you will most certainly relate to at least one part of this movie, and that in itself makes it worthy of a watch."
The Equalizer 3,2023,6.8,"Robert McCall finds himself at home in Southern Italy but he discovers his friends are under the control of local crime bosses. As events turn deadly, McCall knows what he has to do: become his friends' protector by taking on the mafia.","This is a decent and satisfying end to a trilogy. Remember the good ol' days, back in the day, when movies stopped at 3? No Fast X, Saw X, Indiana Jones cracking a whip at 85.Things feel more complete at three.The way things should be.A beginning, a middle and an end.And not some old man doing ridiculous things way beyond his age or physical capability.Denzel is one of the greats.And he deserves credit for never taking a role too far.He's as much a presence on the screen here as he ever has been.His age and wisdom is his real strength.Oh, there will be punches thrown. Bones broken and many cries of agony.But at least it comes from the villains on screen and not those in the audience.Coastal Italy is gorgeous.Denzel is a living legend.You've seen the other two films in this series.Wrap it up nicely with this installment.Ciao."
Argylle,2024,5.6,A reclusive author who writes espionage novels about a secret agent and a global spy syndicate realizes that the plot of the new book she's writing starts to mirror real-world events in real time.,"It's disappointing when a film has an intriguing premise but fails to deliver the goods in the end. Such is the case with director Matthew Vaughn's latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. The problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. Some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that's trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. It leaves viewers asking, ""So what's it going to be?"" There's also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we've already seen before in movies like ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984), ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" (1996) and any number of James Bond flicks. While it's true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring Henry Cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there's a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. Then there's the picture's excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. ""Argylle"" also features a cute, cuddly cat, Alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn't quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what's conveyed in the picture's video marketing. All of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, and a seriously underused Richard E. Grant, not to mention fine turns from Howard and Cavill as alter-egos of one another. This one isn't nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. ""Argylle"" apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we'll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces. At this point, though, I think it has its work cut out for it."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,2023,8.5,"Traveling across the multiverse, Miles Morales meets a new team of Spider-People, made up of heroes from different dimensions. But when the heroes clash over how to deal with a new threat, Miles finds himself at a crossroads.","Reviewers say 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' is celebrated for its stunning animation, dynamic visuals, and inventive narrative. The film excels in character development, especially for Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy, and delves into themes of identity and responsibility. Humor, action, and nostalgic elements are noted strengths. However, some find pacing issues, clich√©s, and overwhelming animation detract from enjoyment. The story's complexity and certain character arcs receive mixed reactions, though the film is largely viewed as a vital addition to the Spider-Verse series."
News of the World,2020,6.8,A Civil War veteran agrees to deliver a girl taken by the Kiowa people years ago to her aunt and uncle against her will. They travel hundreds of miles and face grave dangers as they search for a place that either can call home.,"I am not sure why some people rated this movie below 7 but I really enjoyed it. I was thoroughly entertained because I felt the connection with the characters. Tom has the ability to make the viewers connected to the characters regardless of what role he is playing in a movie as he had done very nicely here in the News of the World. If you are a fan of Hanks, it's worth checking it out...it was worth my time/money...a good recommend and a solid 7 stars."
Seinfeld,,8.9,The continuing misadventures of neurotic New York City stand-up comedian Jerry Seinfeld and his equally neurotic New York City friends.,"Reviewers say 'Seinfeld' is celebrated for its unique humor, quirky characters, and witty dialogue, finding comedy in everyday life. Its innovative narrative and themes of relationships and social commentary stand out. The ensemble cast, led by Jerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Michael Richards, delivered memorable performances. The show introduced many catchphrases and cultural references. Despite criticism for character flaws and moral indifference, its clever writing and fearless humor have made it a comedy classic."
Spaceman,2024,5.7,"Half a year into his solo mission on the edge of the solar system, an astronaut concerned with the state of his life back on Earth is helped by an ancient creature he discovers in the bowels of his ship.","I've seen this movie before; it's called Ad Astra. Ambitious, but emotionally absent(and inconsiderate, I guess) husband leaves perfect wife behind to go on vital space mission. In both movies, the man is plagued by memories of a deeply flawed father, leaving them emotionally scarred and unable to reciprocate their perfect wives' love.While in Ad Astra, Brad Pitt's character discovers his shortcomings pieces at a time: though memory, experience, and various encounters - here, they forgo all nuance. We simply have a spider companion who directly and endlessly tells Adam Sandler what an ass he is to his wife. But both movies share one emotional theme: fathers suck and their sons are not much better. Relationships are all about men needing to open up more. This is not so bad by itself. But I've seen this in so many movies and TV shows by now it's starting to get tiresome. With all the fancy camera-work, heavy performances, and ambient music, this story still just beats you over the head with it's message without offering anything other than an overused clich√©.Other movies in the past have a truly more nuanced approach. Try Solaris(either version), for example. I appreciate the production of this film, really. It's just that this come off as a feminist fantasy rather than good science fiction."
Ricky Gervais: Armageddon,,7.1,"A stand-up show that touches on topics such as artificial intelligence, political correctness, family weddings, funerals, and the end of humanity.","I'm somewhat of a fan. I've genuinely enjoyed some of Ricky Gervais' past specials. This one? Not so much.I honestly don't care whether the material is appropriate or not or whether it crosses a line or not. In humor, I think it's all fair game. They're just jokes and it's all good. So I have zero issues with any of that. My issue is simply that the show was just not very inspired and ultimately not particularly funny. It wasn't bad, but there wasn't much of a coherent narrative for the show, there were many one-liners that fell quite flat, stories that weren't particularly interesting, jokes that didn't elicit anything (at least in me) and quite frankly, Ricky just seemed to be going through the motions in this show. It felt a little phoned in.There are much better stand up shows out there than this one."
CSI: Miami,,6.5,"CSI spin off which follows an elite group of Crime Scene Investigators (CSI's) from the Miami-Dade Police Department (MDPD), who use advanced forensic science and methods to solve complex crimes in cross-cultural Miami, Florida.","I don't really see the purpose of this show other then trying to make more money. The main CSI show is great and has interesting characters. But there is nothing that this show does that the main show doesn't do better and has far better characters. Just because the show is set in Miami we're supposed to tune into basically the same show with inferior actors and less interesting story lines? I don't think so buddy. And it seems like a majority of the CSI Miami characters are cast only upon what they look like.It's just like how you make a copy of a key, the copy never works quite as good as the original. Same thing applies here."
CSI: NY,,7.0,Second CSI spin off which follows the Crime Scene Investigator's (CSI's) of the New York Police Department (NYPD) as they use advanced forensic science to reveal the circumstances behind mysterious and unusual deaths in New York City.,"I really liked this show. The did a great job with the cast. It's one of those groups that gel well together & you hope none of them ever leave the show.
> It's a typical detective/forensic type show involving them catching different types of murders/ serial killers, and the continuing stories of the main characters lives, etc.
> It's way funnier than you'd ever think it pull ne, it has a lot of that quick witted humor, that comes Out of the blue & makes you laugh out loud.
>> It reminds me of the show Bones. Same type of show finding the serial killers with science & cool tech gadgets, with a great cast & lots of good funny humor thrown in.
> And it's a tv show, so I'm not gonna pick it apart for being technically correct or not at every turn. Grain of salt people, if it as 100% accurate, it'd be a documentary."
Demolition,2015,7.0,A woman and her son befriend a successful investment banker whose life begins to unravel following the death of his wife.,"I feel like it had so much potential in the story and characters. As it is, it's just a very jumbled mess, with some really questionable editing. I do find Jake Gyllenhaal's character really intriguing though, and I thought he did some really strong work. I just wish it had a better grasp on the characters. I can't say I didn't find it very watchable though, and I would say it's better than many of the reviews suggest. I hope Jake can get some end-of-the-year traction for this, but I really doubt it. He's endlessly fascinating and very mesmerizing, and definitely carries the film more than the screenplay does. Not sure, perhaps this is a film only a select few will enjoy."
The Kill Room,2023,5.5,"A hitman, his boss, an art dealer and a money-laundering scheme that accidentally turns the assassin into an overnight avant-garde sensation, one that forces her to play the art world against the underworld.","The Kill Room is a crime satire set for slaying in the modern art world. Catering to an audience that might not be hip to those in jokes, director Nicol Paone wisely fills her canvas with the witty Samuel L. Jackson, the sexy Uma Thurman, and the chiseled Joe Manganiello. Although hung on stories seen before, The Kill Room is an entertaining enough piece worth a 98-minute glance in any cinematic gallery.Scripted by Jonathan Jacobson, The Kill Room is amusing crime fiction wrapped in a comedic body bag as Reggie's murders eventually transform into avant-garde art. Reggie becomes known as the Bagman whose art, naturally, becomes more of a success than the laundering biz. The Kill Room itself then dips into a slight case of thievery as the plot follows Woody Allen's Small Time Crooks, which also features a cover business that becomes more of a success than the actual crime. As life imitates art, so too does art imitate art.The Kill Room, like the art being satirized within, has clever subtext but lacks that deep impression. The movie successfully captures the transitory nature of art styles noting such as an allegory of movies as they exist within modern streaming services. The Kill Room itself might not present a shocking spectacle like the Bagman but when paired with a proper wine and cheese, could nicely kill off a Friday night."
Gran Turismo,2023,7.1,"Based on the unbelievable, inspiring true story of a team of underdogs - a struggling, working-class gamer, a failed former race car driver, and an idealistic motorsport exec - who risk it all to take on the most elite sport in the world.","I didn't know much about this movie before I watched it, except that it was based on a video racing game. To be honest, I expected something more akin to the cheesy Fast and Furious movies. I had set a very low bar of anticipation.With that in mind, the reality of this movie was an enormously pleasant surprise: a fascinating true life story that magnificently captured the adrenaline buzz and accomplishments of elite motorsport.The racing scenes, and there's a lot of them, were masterfully created. I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat. It was an emotional rollercoaster; one minute I was grinning with euphoria, then gripping my hands in fear, then I was giggling out loud with a happy release of nervous energy.Being a true life story, it couldn't be spoiled by poor plot writing. I loved the uplifting, feel-good, tale of the talented underdog risking all to achieve his dreams. Yet it wasn't a clich√© because it was real; the movie had no sense of being formulaic or contrived.The acting was spot on, the characters perfectly well developed, and the special effects were both awe inspiring and seamless.The movie was enthralling from start to finish. It's absolutely a contender for being my favourite movie of the year. It's also one of my favourite motorsports movies of all time: and that's a compliment I don't give easily. How did this have so little buzz and anticipation before it was released?"
Crank: High Voltage,2009,6.1,Chelios faces a Chinese mobster who has stolen his nearly indestructible heart and replaced it with a battery-powered ticker which requires regular jolts of electricity to keep working.,"Quite possibly the silliest movie ever made. I'm pretty sure these guys set out to make the ultimate mindless action flick and they succeeded brilliantly IMO. I've never seen anything like it before. IMDb claims the budget was $20M, although that seems like quite a stretch. But there is about $1B worth of craziness in it. The makers didn't hold anything back - no restraint whatsoever and it's amazing. Anyone looking to be offended will be. Guaranteed. I've heard of people walking out of movies but this is the first time I ever saw it happen. I wonder if they asked for their $$$ back. I'm pretty sure the theaters are covered from giving refunds; there's fine print on the tix or something.Anyway, the opening credits are in video game form, which I now realize was a signal. Viewers need to forget reality, not just suspend disbelief in that routine movie kind of way. These guys throw everything they can think of up on the screen and I kept wondering what drugs they were using during filming. Maybe all of them. Also, there's something to irritate everybody. I really mean that; I don't think any insult or stereotype or slur was left out. Nothing offensive was held back that I could notice, although I've led a sheltered life.Now here's the switch: it's hilarious and I mean laugh-out-loud funny from start to finish. I saw scenes I never saw before or ever expected to see. It starts out so unbelievably crazy that it's actually shocking (sorry) and then just keeps it up and keeps it going for the entire flick. Dark Chocolate's elaborate eye-roll sequence is one for the ages and is worth the price of admission all by itself.Here's how funny it is: SpikeTV showed it and of course had to make countless cuts: not just the copious female nudity but the language and graphic violence and so on. Anyway, with all that gone it was still incredibly funny and astounding and just totally insane. The ending was a set-up for a sequel, same way the first ""Crank"" was, but I honestly don't see how they can top this one. Maybe I'm wrong; I sure hope so but it seems to me that they deliberately made it as wild as possible and didn't hold anything back.One last word: it's not for everyone. I promise you'll either absolutely love it or thoroughly despise it. There will be no in-between for this one."
Wicked Little Letters,2023,7.0,"When people in Littlehampton--including conservative local, Edith--begin receiving letters full of hilarious profanities, the rowdy, Irish migrant, Rose, is charged with the crime. Suspecting that something is amiss, the town's women investigate.","Very good, this!'Wicked Little Letters' is fun. Olivia Colman and Jessie Buckley impress in lead roles, both managing to stand out just as much as the other - Colman is particularly perfectly cast. The rest of them merit praise as well, namely Anjana Vasan and Timothy Spall.There isn't much more to note about this really and I don't mean that in a negative way whatsoever. It's all competently put together, as those onscreen bring this rather simple film to life - and I like those type of movies. Well worth a watch! Happy that I managed to catch it at the cinema on the big screen, always nice."
John Wick: Chapter 4,2023,7.6,"John Wick uncovers a path to defeating The High Table. But before he can earn his freedom, Wick must face off against a new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe and forces that turn old friends into foes.","Reviewers say 'John Wick: Chapter 4' is lauded for its intense action, impressive stunts, and Keanu Reeves' performance. The film's high-octane action, stunning visuals, and expanded universe are highlighted. However, criticisms include its lengthy runtime, lack of plot development, and repetitive action scenes. Story inconsistencies and character motivations are also noted. Despite these issues, many find the film enjoyable for its thrilling action and engaging performances."
The Last Vermeer,2019,6.7,"An artist is suspected of selling a valuable painting to the Nazis, but there is more to the story than meets the eye.","""The Last Vermeer"" paints an intelligent, intriguing picture of World War II involving art, Nazis and an unlikely Dutch hero. Dan Friedkin's directorial debut manages to deliver a thriller while offering instruction on the art of Johannes Vermeer. Guy Pearce stars and gives a work of art performance as the flamboyant Han van Meegeren, a Dutch painter, art dealer and enigma who became famous for selling a rare Vermeer to Hitler's second in command, Hermann G√∂ring. This act led Meegeren to be tried in 1945 as a war criminal. Captain Joseph Piller, played by actor Claes Bang, is the former Dutch Resistance officer who believes Meegeren's innocence, helping and defending him in court. The screenplay, written by Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby (writers of 2007's ""First Snow,"" also starring Guy Pearce) & John Orloff, is based on an adaptation of Jonathan Lopez's, ""The Man Who Made Vermeers."""
Baby Reindeer,,7.7,"The story follows Donny's warped relationship with a female stalker and the impact it has on him as he is ultimately forced to face a deep, dark buried trauma.","... This is THAT good! It's truly a tour de force (and forgive me for using that terminology but omg! OMG! When you write something this significant AND do it the justice it demands in the acting.. I mean... Ya 'tour den force' is the only fitting phrase) - it took me awhile to truly appreciate what I was looking at, what he was conveying and why but.. Sheesh! And lemme tell you right now, a 9 from me is exceptional! (for reference I reserve tens for things like an Attenborough nature documentary, or maaaybe Rick and Morty but both of those are for different reasons - I never bestow the NINER - but it's warranted - congratulations man, you should be very VERY proud - THANK YOU for this! Thank you FOR YOU!"
Tom Segura: Sledgehammer,,7.1,"Tom discusses his ""admiration"" for Brad Pitt, what it's like to raise two sons, and the lessons he learned from sharing his gummies with his mother at a performance in Phoenix, Arizona, in front of an energizing sold-out audience.","This ""show"" is so bad i had to force myself to finish it. It took me three tries because i kept falling asleep. It is mind numbingly boring, weak and bland. There are zero jokes in it. I kept wondering how this guy ended up on the stage with this weak performance. Lame attempts of telling jokes mixed with inappropriate stories. ( Side note: do not shower with your kid!) The laughs felt fake. The stories were sleep inducing and pointless.If this is the best he can do then i don't get his fame. There are better amateurs out there than him. Maybe the other reviewers are right and he was funnier in the past..."
The Highwaymen,2019,6.9,The untold true story of the legendary detectives who brought down Bonnie and Clyde.,"We all saw the movieBonnie and Clyde (1967)directed byArthur Penn. In France, we all heard the eponymous song (Brigitte BardotandSerge Gainsbourg, 1968). The Highwaymen is a mirror version with two retired Rangers in pursuit of the infamous outlawsClyde BarrowandBonnie Parker, considered as Robin Hood and his beloved wife by the plebs. A dead or alive hunt, in the 30's. Knowing that dead is a priori more practical, we suspect from the outset, even if we do not know the story, that it will probably be the chosen solution. In many aspects, I perceive the atmosphere ofUnforgiven (1992)directed byClint Eastwood, with its predictable and ineluctable ending, with cars and heavy machine guns instead of horses and Remingtons.The actors, the photography, the costumes, the cars, the atmosphere of the post-1929 Great Depression, the rhythm, the dialogues, the soundtrack, ... This is an excellent movie! As a synthesis: 8/9 of 10."
Daliland,2022,5.9,"In 1973, a young gallery assistant goes on a wild adventure behind the scenes as he helps the aging genius Salvador Dali prepare for a big show in New York.","You have seen this a million times before: young mangenue enters the magical world of X where things he couldn't have ever imagined change his vision of the world and inspire him to greatness. This time is a young beautiful boy from New York who gets to be part of Dali's world at the end of his career. And just like any young person he wants to feel special and part of something greater than himself, only to realize that it's all a facade behind which people are still regular old people.The formula has been used again and again and again because it works, but you have to implement it in a way that captivates and inspires. You have to make art if you want to showcase art, even if it is a cheap copy of other great films in the genre you have to at least reach that level of competence. Unfortunately Daliland feels just as naive as the main character is supposed to be, wanting to be more than it is without effort and realizing no one thinks they're special. And funnily enough, the ending of the film does involve cheap knock-offs of Dali's work, which felt inadvertently hilarious.Ben Kingsley is his usual good actor, without aspiring to greatness, Barbara Sukowa too, the rest of the cast are more props than anything else. And Christopher Briney is the perfect casting choice for the lead role: a pretty face. The sets are good, yet feel cheap all the same. The entire production feels a carbon copy of something better that you've seen before.Bottom line: I don't recommend the film."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,,8.5,"The dark mind of Daniel Sloss is back, and he's ready to find the funny in some very taboo topics, from the deeply personal to the highly irreverent.","Daniel Sloss easily jumps from topic to topic, effortlessly stitching the show together - going from jaw-dropping topics to heartfelt comments in the wink of an eye.I hope there will be more!"
Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver,2024,5.3,"Kora and surviving warriors prepare to defend Veldt, their new home, alongside its people against the Realm. The warriors face their pasts, revealing their motivations before the Realm's forces arrive to crush the growing rebellion.","This has been bothering me for a day or so now. I have literally never written a review before. But, I had to share what I'm seeing with others.I've seen people compare this movie/movies to Star wars and Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress. But I mean a small town being pushed around by a massive force. Who looks for warriors to help keep their town.Anyways, it's not bad but not great either. It's a nice action movie for at home viewing. If your looking for a strong story or edge of your seat action. Then this movie isn't for you. But if you're looking for something to watch on Saturday night then just have fun and don't think about it."
Semmelweis,2023,6.8,"In 1847 a mysterious epidemic is raging in a maternity clinic in Vienna, while the doctor Ign√°c Semmelweis tries to defeat puerperal fever by going against all traditional theories.","The unbreakable element makes a person great, a touching true story based on reality, the image and reality are fascinating. In Hungary today, Semmelweis is a real historical person, I think he portrayed a big problem of the time very well. Check out! In this story, the person is very sympathetic, because if he has a family, he thinks about the big problems and questions of the past, which he could have fixed in a short time with today's knowledge. Great knowledge and thinking can fix these problems, and fortunately it was once again a Hungarian person who was able to fix this, despite the many enemies and skepticism, things were fixed even at that time!"
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,2023,5.6,"Black Manta seeks revenge on Aquaman for his father's death. Wielding the Black Trident's power, he becomes a formidable foe. To defend Atlantis, Aquaman forges an alliance with his imprisoned brother. They must protect the kingdom.","Reviewers say 'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom' offers vibrant underwater visuals and thrilling action, with strong performances from Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson. However, the film faces criticism for its predictable script, inconsistent CGI, and superficial handling of themes like climate change. While Momoa and Wilson's dynamic is praised, the supporting cast and villains are often seen as underwhelming. The sequel is deemed entertaining but flawed, struggling to match its predecessor's success."
Belfast,2021,7.2,A young boy and his working-class Belfast family experience the tumultuous late 1960s.,"Kenneth Branagh delivers a beautiful, heartfelt film about a family in 1969 Belfast. Branagh's love for the town of Belfast is palpable. The cast is superb--especially, Caitriona Balfe, whose portrayal as a wife and mother, torn between staying in her native Belfast as religious and political violence escalates or moving to England for her family's safety, is heartbreaking."
Poor Things,2023,7.8,"An account of the fantastical evolution of Bella Baxter, a young woman brought back to life by the brilliant and unorthodox scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter.","Reviewers say 'Poor Things' is visually striking with standout performances by Emma Stone and Willem Dafoe. It delves into feminism, liberation, and societal norms through a surreal lens. Critics laud its unique cinematography and bold storytelling but note uneven pacing and character depth. The film's sexual content and portrayal of Bella have sparked controversy, making it a thought-provoking yet divisive experience."
A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,2019,7.2,"Lloyd Vogel, a cynical journalist, gets acquainted with a kind-hearted television host Fred Rogers while writing an article on him. With time, they strike an unlikely friendship.","This didn't get much of a theatrical run here in the UK, and possibly gets lost in translation, as we don't really know much about Mr Rogers, whereas in the US he is a massive icon from people's childhoods.On it's own merits though this is a good film, with two stellar performances from Rhys and Hanks.A little slow in places, it does contain some wonderful messages, that stayed with me long after the credits rolled."
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,2018,7.2,"Six tales of life and violence in the Old West, following a singing gunslinger, a bank robber, a traveling impresario, an elderly prospector, a wagon train and a perverse pair of bounty hunters.","I'm not really sure were I stand with this film, it started off really well, but just went down hill. I liked a couple of the stories, but some are just really weird. The cinematography is excellent. I stuck with it till the very end but was very close to switching it off but something just kept me watching it.I would say its worth giving it ago, but don't be surprised if you don't like it."
The Menu,2022,7.2,"A young couple travels to a remote island to eat at an exclusive restaurant where the chef has prepared a lavish menu, with some shocking surprises.","Reviewers say 'The Menu' is a darkly comedic satire critiquing pretentious fine dining and elite culture. Themes include social commentary on class disparity and the absurdity of high-end dining. Critics praise Ralph Fiennes, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Nicholas Hoult's performances. Some find the satire inconsistent, questioning pacing, plot coherence, and character development. Despite mixed feelings, many appreciate the unique premise and stylish direction."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,2023,6.0,"Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne are dragged into the Quantum Realm, along with Hope's parents and Scott's daughter Cassie. Together they must find a way to escape, but what secrets is Hope's mother hiding? And who is the mysterious Kang?","Reviewers say 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania' offers mixed reactions. Visual effects and Jonathan Majors' portrayal of Kang the Conqueror receive praise, alongside Paul Rudd's charm. However, humor and plot coherence are criticized. The Quantum Realm's exploration is visually stunning yet lacks depth. The convoluted plot and underutilized characters disappoint some. Reliance on CGI and a weak story are noted downsides. Despite flaws, it is considered a fun Marvel addition."
Fair Play,2023,6.4,"An unexpected promotion at a cutthroat hedge fund pushes a young couple's relationship to the brink, threatening to unravel far more than their recent engagement.","7.9 stars.Long time since I've seen a movie quite like this. There are a lot of psychological thrillers out there, but very few pull off this genre as effectively as 'Fair Play'.These are some actors I'm not very familiar with, although his role as Han Solo was noteworthy, even though I didn't totally love that movie. I see she's in Bridgerton and I watched several episodes.What totally caught me off guard was how methodically this film escalates to the inevitable destruction of two previously beautiful and intelligent lovers. No momentum is lost as it builds and builds at a steady and thrilling pace until they implode. What is truly chilling - this is a plausible outcome given the right circumstances. Take an underachiever coupled with someone out of their league, mix in a little crazy and you've stumbled on the narrative of 'Fair Play'. I've seen situations like this with my own relatives when they had a few too many (if you know what I mean) and this couple has a few too many throughout this story. I don't believe the director or writers even realize fully what they are presenting to us. Take the wealth, prestige, good looks, charm, and too much fire water, and you have the perfect set of circumstances, leading to the demise of two talented and lovely young adults.This thriller is all about emasculation and lack of confidence in an otherwise normal and down-to-earth guy. In all respects, she is well adjusted, he is not, and this disconnect is the root of their dismantling. As the couple spirals even further into chaos, you might be surprised at how the story ends. The final scene is absolutely brilliant."
The Marvels,2023,5.5,"Carol Danvers gets her powers entangled with those of Kamala Khan and Monica Rambeau, forcing them to work together to save the universe.","Reviewers say 'The Marvels' offers fun, quirky moments and enjoyable performances, particularly from Iman Vellani, but suffers from a convoluted plot and underdeveloped characters. The film's humor is divisive, with some finding it entertaining and others excessive. Visual effects and action sequences receive mixed feedback, and the reliance on Marvel tropes is criticized. Overall, it's an enjoyable yet flawed Marvel entry."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,2023,7.9,"Still reeling from the loss of Gamora, Peter Quill rallies his team to defend the universe and one of their own - a mission that could mean the end of the Guardians if not successful.","Reviewers say 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3' delves into family, loss, and redemption, spotlighting Rocket Raccoon's past. The film blends humor, action, and emotion, though some find its tone uneven. Bradley Cooper's voice performance for Rocket is lauded. The soundtrack and visual effects enhance the immersive experience. Critics value character growth and the series' conclusion, yet opinions on pacing and plot points differ. The darker tone and mature themes receive mixed reactions, showcasing a spectrum of positive, neutral, and negative feedback."
The Banshees of Inisherin,2022,7.7,"Two lifelong friends find themselves at an impasse when one abruptly ends their relationship, with alarming consequences for both of them.","Enjoyed this far more than I expected. The plot feels both incredibly simple and deeply symbolic. So much so it leaves you pondering it's meaning long after the credits roll.What's better - to lead a simple but honest, good life or be remembered for something deeper and more far reaching - and indeed why should there be a choice between the two?The love for the animals gives the characters a sweet charm and innocence, and they're all still likeable despite strangeness and flaws.It is strange, at times funny, poignant, sweet, and most certainly watchable. Great acting all round and a breath of fresh air."
Reptile,2023,6.8,"Tom Nichols is a hardened New England detective, unflinching in his pursuit of a case where nothing is as it seems and it begins to dismantle the illusions in his own life.","Set in the town of Scarborough, Detective Tom Nichols (Benecio del Toro) and his partner Dan Cleary (Ato Essandoh) investigate the murder of real-estate broker Summer Elswick (Matilda Lutz). As the two run down possible suspects including Summer's boyfriend Will Grady (Justin Timberlake), her ex-husband Sam Gifford (Karl Glusman), and a man with a grudge against the Gradys named Eli Phillips (Michael Pitt), the case goes from a simple murder to something of larger scale implications.Reptile is the feature film debut of music video director Grant Singer who also co-wrote the script alongside Benjamin Brewer and the film's star and executive producer Benicio Del Toro. Singer and Brewer wrote the initial draft of the film in 2018 where it was acquired by Black Label Media who'd previously worked with Del Toro on the Sicario films and upon showing it to him he became a huge proponent of the project. With a gritty noir story, an all star cast, and an Autumn adjacent release date you can tell Netflix wants this to be their equivalent of Gone Baby Gone or Prisoners as that dark horse crime thriller that scores some Oscar nominations, and while it doesn't reach those heights unfortunately it's an ultimately decent detective thriller with a strong sense of style and some committed performances.Despite being the debut feature of Grant Singer, he shows a strong grasp on filmmaking from a stylistic and technical sense with the film given some solid shots that capture the environments in which Nichols investigates. With a predominantly suburban setting that often uses the states of various homes like McMansion Grady is trying to sell having signs of vermin infestation or a neglected swimming pool with stagnant water, you get the sense Singer is trying to capture that underlying sense of rot within these seemingly idyllic homes. While Tom Nichols isn't given the greatest depth as a protagonist, del Toro who serves as a co-writer on the film does add some humanity to the role especially in regards to his relationship with his wife Judy played by Alicia Silverstone who takes what could've been an underwritten character and makes her more of a confidant who actually assists Tom on several occasions and the two have some solid chemistry together. Where the movie faulters for me unfortunately is in the mystery aspect of the film especially in how it establishes its array of suspects only for us to switch gears at the one hour mark where we begin another decidedly different investigation. The writing in the film while fine most of the time is perfectly fine (if not exceptional) but it does lead to some groanworthy dialogue exchanges and a fake-out dream sequence that I didn't really care for.For those who like dramatic procedural thrillers of this kind you will find some good elements to appreciate here especially in how it relates to the acting and visuals on display. The movie itself as a mystery I'm sorry to say fell somewhat flat for me despite seemingly having all the right pieces in play. A slight stumble out the gate for Grant Singer, but one that shows promise if given refinement."
A Haunting in Venice,2023,6.5,"In post-World War II Venice, Poirot, now retired and living in his own exile, reluctantly attends a seance. But when one of the guests is murdered, it is up to the former detective to once again uncover the killer.","This was surprisingly spookier than I thought it would be but it was happily welcomed during this Halloween Season. It was spooky without being cheesy or goofy which is what a lot of traditional horror movies tend to lean towards. I saw it in theaters but can definitely see myself cuddling up on the couch with a hot chocolate and a blanket to watch this film in the autumn.You can tell Tina Fey isn't used to playing more serious roles but she pulled it off enough. It was definitely a surprise to see her in this film, especially as such a large character.I would love to see more Poirot in the future as Kenneth Branagh does a great job portraying him.This film was a good length too. Not too long and not too short.I'd recommend this to those who enjoy a little spook and mystery but not for anyone looking for light hearted Halloween fun."
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,2022,6.6,The people of Wakanda fight to protect their home from intervening world powers as they mourn the death of King T'Challa.,"Reviewers say 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' is an emotional tribute to Chadwick Boseman, delving into grief and legacy. It is lauded for its powerful performances by Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett, and impressive visuals. Criticisms include its long runtime, lack of focus, and underdeveloped characters. Some feel it struggles with identity and mixed reactions to new characters like Namor. Overall, it is seen as a heartfelt continuation of the 'Black Panther' legacy."
Dragonball Evolution,2009,2.5,"The young warrior Son Goku sets out on a quest, racing against time and the vengeful King Piccolo, to collect a set of seven magical orbs that will grant their wielder unlimited power.","Let me just start off by saying that there are no redeeming qualities to this movie at all. The multi-million dollar budget has amounted to a teen drama mixed with power rangers. The final product is insulting, to say the least.The creators of this horrible, horrible adaption should take a good long think about what they have done and why they should have just followed the source material instead of taken it for granted. Do they really think that the entire Dragonball fan-base is this stupid? Akira Toriyama probably has a noose around his neck right about now.To finish this off: The acting is atrocious, the butt-rock scattered through the soundtrack will make you want to punch the guy running the theater in the face, and the story is basically the manga's, but cut up, put into a blender, stuffed into sausage skins, and stitched back together with an American flag tied around it.If you want your Dragonball fix, just buy dvds of the show instead, skip the movie, and if you don't skip it, then at least don't pay for this thing. I heard that a sequel is already in the works, and we don't need a trilogy, that would be three of these movies too many."
The Black Phone,2021,6.9,"After being abducted and locked in a basement, a boy starts receiving calls on a disconnected phone from the killer's previous victims.","An intense movie, worth a watch. May make your skin crawl/Takes me back to my days as a kid growing up in Houston and the Houston Mass Murders. Wiki one of the killers, Elmer Wayne Henley for the story."
Haunt,2019,6.3,"On Halloween, a group of friends encounter an ""extreme"" haunted house that promises to feed on their darkest fears. The night turns deadly as they come to the horrifying realization that some nightmares are real.",Fun Halloween haunted house film but the story was has recycled over and over again and this version brought nothing new to the table.
The Creator,2023,6.7,"Against the backdrop of a war between humans and robots with artificial intelligence, a former soldier finds the robots' secret weapon to end the conflict, an AI in the form of a child.","I watched this from start to finish without being drawn into the story at any point.I think John Washington is miscast here, I had the same exact experience when i watched Tenet... found myself very disconnected as I he didn't seem to make a proper connection with the role he was portraying.That is not to say the film isn't without issues. They have been fairly well documented by other reviewers so I'll not labour the points here.My main issue is with the lack of emotional involvment with the characters. The film measures zero on the emtional richter scale, but more, the screenplay just doesn't manage to get you excited or involved with anything that is unfolding. Additionally, the characters seem to have little connection to each other. In fact it is only at the end of the movie that Joshua and Alphie seem to have any tangible emotional cohesion.Contrast this with The Golden Child 1986 where Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell and the connection he makes to The Golden Child played by J. L. Reate. Here you can see what a great connection is established on screen and the massive difference in outcome it produces. Both films have two similar sets of pairings in almost identical scenarios with a stark contrast in outcome.Additionally Thought the film is incredible to look at, much of what unfolds makes no sense. I'd liken this film to an iconic fashion show where the crowd Oohs and Aahs at the fantastic creations that unfold on the runway, that no one (bar Lady Gaga) would ever be caught dead in at a normal social event.Anyway, for me the film was a big dissapointment, I can't say John David Washington was the cause of this since the Movie has many other problematic aspects, but the ones I've mentioned were particularly significant for me.5/10 sadly."
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,2023,6.5,Archaeologist Indiana Jones races against time to retrieve a legendary artifact that can change the course of history.,"So much negativity ahead of the release considering the role of a certain female support character. Then lots of stories about early reviews being bad to mediocre at best. We went to see it today and honestly, I liked it.. quite a lot! This isn't a story about replacing Indiana Jones with a female character. This is a really good final film and a worthy send off for our beloved adventurer. Don't expect it to be as good as the original three films. Go in with an open mind and realistic expectations, and you'll walk out entertain and humming a famous tune. In the end that's what Indiana Jones movies are all about."
Beckham,,8.1,"With never-before-seen footage, this docuseries follows David Beckham's meteoric rise from humble beginnings to global football stardom.","I lived the growing of the figure of David Beckham as a teen. I was only 4 years younger than him. And honestly, on the early days I thought it was only a marketing product. But men, I was wrong.First, the documentary is pretty well done. It shows the mostly lights possible but also the dark. The darkness David Beckham lived as an iconic ultra mediatic person. What a nightmare.Second, I like the way Beckham is shown here. Human. Not only the golden balls boy. He mostly accepted all the criticism with a pair of golden balls. That was raw.Last, I recommend the documentary if you want to know who was the most iconic and mediatic person in football before CR7 - Messi era. Sir David Beckham."
Turning Red,2022,6.9,"A thirteen-year-old girl named Mei Lee is torn between staying her mother's dutiful daughter and the changes of adolescence. And as if the challenges were not enough, whenever she gets overly excited Mei transforms into a giant red panda.","Reviewers say 'Turning Red' has mixed reviews, with some praising its animation and others criticizing it for being unappealing. The plot is deemed predictable and formulaic, lacking originality. Puberty themes are either seen as too explicit or inadequately handled for family audiences. Pacing issues and filler scenes are noted, along with underdeveloped supporting characters. Despite these criticisms, some appreciate the film's attempt to address complex themes and its vibrant animation style."
Atlas,2024,5.6,"In a bleak-sounding future, an A.I. soldier has determined that the only way to end war is to end humanity.","Was it great no!!! Will it hold a spot in the Sci-fi Hall of Fame No!! But Did it hold me and Family attention for 2hr sure did.. The CGI was top notch, story was nothing new,but in today's world where AI is real thing you feal a little bit closer to the story than say 40 years ago when Terminator came out..Jlo is no Ripley from Aliens but she tried.. The back and forth between her and Smith was entertaining. Everyone is entitled to there opinions but to say this movie is Trash just because Jlo is in it, is crazy . And Simu Lui who plays Harlen the ""Bad Guy"" did a good job also. Don't let some of these reviews stop from watching a Decent chilling at home on the couch with some popcorn movie.."
Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,2021,7.3,"Shang-Chi, the master of weaponry-based Kung Fu, is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization.","Reviewers say 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' is lauded for its dynamic fight scenes, striking visuals, and standout performances by Simu Liu and Tony Leung. The film is appreciated for its cultural representation and mythological elements. However, some critics find the plot formulaic and the character development lacking, particularly for the protagonist. Issues with pacing and logical inconsistencies are noted. Despite these flaws, it is seen as a visually captivating and enjoyable Marvel entry."
The Swan,2023,6.7,A small brilliant boy is tormented by two large idiotic bullies.,"A young boy relentlessly bullied by two older boys finally finds the strength to escape his tormentors. The pair of cruel older boys, who enjoy shooting songbirds in the hedgerow and ultimately kill the titular bird while it's nurturing its young are so repulsive that they drift into caricature (as perhaps was the intent, as they are figments of the narrator's memories). Like Anderson's other recent Dahl interpretations, 'The Swan' is a stagy, borderline surreal, meta-production that puts style far ahead of content. The cast is great, as is the intricate imagery, so I enjoyed the short despite the disagreeable and mean-spirited cruelty that permeates the story."
Prey,2022,7.1,"Naru, a skilled warrior of the Comanche Nation, fights to protect her tribe against one of the first highly-evolved Predators to land on Earth.","Reviewers say 'Prey' is a solid addition to the Predator franchise, praised for its return to series roots, Amber Midthunder's strong performance, and engaging action sequences. The Native American context and atmospheric cinematography are lauded. However, pacing, script, and character development receive criticism. The Predator's portrayal and protagonist's abilities are deemed unrealistic by some. Themes of female empowerment and indigenous representation are divisive. CGI and plot points also garner mixed reactions."
Deadpool & Wolverine,2024,7.5,"Deadpool is offered a place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by the Time Variance Authority, but instead recruits a variant of Wolverine to save his universe from extinction.","Reviewers say 'Deadpool & Wolverine' is an entertaining film with standout performances from Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, delivering humor, action, and memorable moments. The chemistry between the two actors is praised, with their banter and interactions being highlights. However, some critics point out issues with the script, pacing, and plot, noting that the film could have benefited from tighter editing and more concise dialogue. Despite these flaws, the film is considered a fun and enjoyable experience for fans of the characters."
Joyride,2022,6.2,"A headstrong solicitor's plan to offload her new born baby to her sister, is derailed when a vulnerable but opinionated teenager steals their taxi.",The plot is definitely messy at time's and it's probably a wee bit smultzy in places.However it's a charming film with great acting.Probably more a TV film than one for the cinema.Definitely worth a watch though.
Godzilla Minus One,2023,7.7,A kamikaze pilot plagued by survivor's guilt seeks redemption when a giant monster he failed to kill is transformed by radiation from atomic bomb tests and lays siege to post-war Japan.,"I just saw the advanced screening of Godzilla minus one and I have to say I was very pleased with the final product. If I had any complaints about this movie it is just that the CGI Godzilla often looked weird similar to a video game. However when Godzilla looked good, it was very impressive especially in the water scenes.Unlike every other Godzilla movie I have ever seen this is the first Godzilla movie where I actually liked on the characters and the storyline actually made sense and touched the human heart. It showed what people were dealing with at that time which was directly after world war II and how people were suffering not only with the after effects of the war but also the trauma from being exposed to a huge monster destroying cities.Godzilla may be a fictional character but loss and tragedy are real, and people are dealing with it everyday.Overall I really like this movie and it is obviously a prequel to the original Godzilla movie that came out over 70 years ago. Once you see this movie at some point you will understand why.What I would really like to see since it is clear that there have been multiple Godzilla's at some point in time is some type of legitimate crossover between toho and the American studios who are producing Godzilla monster verse in America. Last thing I or any fans want to see is a competition on who could spit out different and unique Godzilla's in two different countries.Since this is a Toho and Japanese produced movie, it would have been nice to have some of the theater edition Godzilla toys for sale like they do in Japan on every release."
Ticket to Paradise,2022,6.1,A divorced couple teams up and travels to Bali to stop their daughter from making the same mistake they think they made 25 years ago.,"Following their tempestuous relationship of 19 years (including the recovery), an acrimonious divorced couple travel millions of miles from home, then enter a momentary truce to stop the pending nuptials of their only daughter who just recently graduated from college and got engaged on a whim in Bali. Lazy star vehicle doesn't offer much in the way of surprise or originality, it's also light on laughs and ineffective on drama, thus it's mostly a chance to witness the snap, crackle, and pop repartee of a well-matched Roberts and Clooney. The scenery is good too, making it even more comfortable to sit through. **"
A History of Violence,2005,7.4,"A mild-mannered man becomes a local hero through an act of violence, which sets off repercussions that will shake his family to its very core.",I honestly don't understand why this movie has such a big score. I was hoping for intrigue. But this movie is so plain and basic. Even acting was poor.
The Hateful Eight,2015,7.8,"In the dead of a Wyoming winter, a bounty hunter and his prisoner find shelter in a cabin currently inhabited by a collection of nefarious characters.","Reviewers say 'The Hateful Eight' is a complex film with standout performances, especially from Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Praised for its cinematography, Morricone's score, and Tarantino's dark humor and violence, it explores themes of race, revenge, and post-Civil War America. However, some find it overly long, slow-paced, and heavy-handed with dialogue and violence. Its structure and mystery elements are unique, yet opinions on its impact vary, making it a significant yet divisive addition to Tarantino's work."
Matt Rife: Lucid - A Crowd Work Special,2024,6.4,"In Netflix's first-ever crowd work special, Matt Rife gets up close and personal with an unpredictable Charlotte audience to riff on all things dreams.",I will admit I only lasted about 15 minutes. The first bit with the mother-daughter seemed totally staged. It had to have been staged and that just seems like cheating and a gimmick. I really like him in his short videos and he does sell out. Tried to get tickets to see him while he was in Maine. They even had to add a couple of shows because they sold out so quickly. But maybe he sticks to his own material and doesn't do crowd work. There's no way you can convince me that that mother and daughter were not planted there. This just absolutely no way it's believable so for that reason I turned it off and came here to leave a review.
Godzilla,1998,5.5,French nuclear tests irradiate an iguana into a giant monster that heads off to New York City. The American military must chase the monster across the city to stop it before it reproduces.,"Some corny parts and bad acting but still pretty entertaining overall. Fast-paced with lots of great action throughout. And Godzilla is a beast!I can't argue it's good, but it's fun.(about 4 viewings, 8/12/2025)"
Elemental,2023,7.0,"Follows Ember and Wade, in a city where fire-, water-, earth- and air-residents live together.","HOT TAKE: Elemental is amazing. Yes, pun intended but I'm so serious here, folks; this was very done and I urge you to give it a fair shot. Elemental is a modern yet fantastical odyssey of romance and self-realization clashing with the weight of ethnic and generational expectations. A colorful and cultural onslaught of imagination, relatability and sentiment, tailored by two endearing leads with irresistible chemistry.I'm usually not one for romcoms but if the leads are engaging enough, then I'm sold. Ember and Wade - voiced by fresh talent Leah Lewis and Mamoudou Athie, respectively - share a captivating journey together, one that isn't just focused on love but puts their humanity in a binding spotlight. Their relationship flows oh-so naturally and is 10x more enchanting than any prince and princess story. You know that scene from WALL-E where the robots dance outside the spaceship? Almost the entirety of Elemental follows that one gorgeous sequence's beat and it's utterly charming.The animation is quite stunning to behold; fluid, expressive and diverse. I can tell Pixar had so much fun with it while pushing the envelope; such a delight to watch. The world drips with inventiveness and attention to detail; I wouldn't pass on living in Element City. I can't leave out Thomas Newman's music, too. This is the composer's fourth collaboration with Pixar (the first since Finding Dory) and his score doesn't disappoint; lovely, often hypnotizing, and always hits the right notes.Elemental is one of the most soulful and compassionate pictures to come out of Pixar in recent years and it's getting such a bum rap for no good reason. Look, it may seem familiar on the surface but - as expected from the studio that pioneered the art form and tells personal stories - Elemental is built from real relationships and social conflicts and has moving answers to questions on affection, immigration, pressure, sacrifice, and free will. Prepare for some sniffles and tears. I felt the love that was put into it every second and that standing ovation at Cannes was well-earned.Congrats, Peter Sohn. Thanks for telling your story."
Matt Rife: Natural Selection,,5.0,"Matt embarked on a sold-out world tour. Now in his first Netflix comedy special, Matt leaves no topic untouched - from crystals to social media trolls - and no audience member spared.","I can't tell you how disappointing this is my girlfriend and I really enjoy the clips of him we see on Instagram and I actually waited a full week so we can watch this together. I can't tell you how cringey and bad the special is. Granted I only made it about 20 minutes in so it could have improved markedly at some point but I highly doubt it. I swear to God I think we giggled at one thing in that period and it was only because it related to something we had just had a conversation about. I can't tell if the clips I see on Instagram are more about his ability to interact with the crowd which I think he's really good at but his jokes are just Bland and flat and appear to be just rehashed from other comedians. Beautiful is chiseled Jaw can only take him so far and I feel like this special was bad enough where he won't even get to implode like a Dane Cook at a later date. Truly absolute garbage from the start to well I guess not finish, but you know what I mean. I wasn't looking to hate here at all trust me I really thought this was going to be awesome I was pretty excited and what a let down."
The Roast of Tom Brady,2024,7.2,"Tom Brady faces the heat in this livestreamed, star-studded roast hosted by Kevin Hart.","I grew up watching these roasts on Comedy Central cable TV, and despite knowing next to nothing about the characters on stage, I loved nearly every roast through the kills and spills as its own unique form of comedy. Now, it's been 5 years, and after years of watching Netflix and YouTube internet comedy grow into its own, I can certifiably say The Roast series is back on top of the comedy world with this one.They packed so much gold into one (Netflix!) (live?!) presentation that I don't even know where to start. Not even a football fan, but I am a huge comedy nut, and who hasn't heard some great Brady jabs over the years. I used to be a big Kevin Hart hater, but honestly he got it figured out with this one. Segura & Bert I just can't handle for a second, and Glaser oh my god I wanted not to laugh so bad that I was actually crying by the end of her segment.If you even know just 2 or 3 people on that stage, I can guarantee you will walk away from this recording with your sides in outer orbit. Downright hilarious :)"
Amsterdam,2022,6.1,"In the 1930s, three friends witness a murder, are framed for it, and uncover one of the most outrageous plots in American history.",Can't see why there are so many negative reviews unless it's right wing trolls or the typical american cluelessness about the country's past (and present) and painfully limited attention span. GREAT cast. You have to be patient with films like this and I'm sorry that that's enough to turn off so many people. The editing is a bit rough at times but not enough to warrant the negativity.Now I have to meet the required character count so feel free to ignore the rest of this review and GIVE THIS MOVIE A CHANCE! I'd watch these actors in almost anything so I was happy the indifference to this film turned out to be unjustified.
"As Above, So Below: The Underworld of 'John Wick'",,7.7,A close look at the assassin's lifestyle in the film.,Included as a special feature on the 4k UltraHD release of John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017).
A Family Affair,2024,5.4,"A surprising romance kicks off comic consequences for a young woman, her mother, and her movie-star boss as they face the complications of love, sex, and identity.","Nicole Kidman, judging solely by the expensive LA-area home of hers, is successful author Brooke Harwood. Her husband passed away some 11 years earlier and she is living a mostly quiet life with a 24-yr-old daughter who has moved back in while trying to get her movie or TV production career energized.Her daughter works as an assistant for an often juvenile, demanding, and entitled actor, played by Zac Efron as Chris Cole. Strictly by accident Chris meets Brooke, not even knowing who she is. He is smitten, even though later the two characters say that he is 16 years younger than Brooke. (In real life Kidman is 21 years older than Efron.)The daughter is played by Joey King as Zara Ford. King is one of the better actresses of her generation and her role here is no exception. In fact, even though Kidman and Efron are the bigger stars, and much of the focus in on their budding relationship, the story is more Zara's story. She knows Chris very well and she desperately wants to convince her mother that he is not good for her. Zara's character arc is to respect her mother and her choices.The whole movie is more about Zara than anything else.Also in a very good role is veteran Kathy Bates as the grandma,
Leila Ford. She has a special relationship with Zara and is instrumental in helping her face reality.My wife and I watched it streaming, it is a better movie than we thought it was going to be."
Dangerous Minds,1995,6.5,"LouAnne, a retired US marine, becomes a teacher in a Californian high school. But her mostly Latino and black students from an impoverished and racially segregated locality do not easily embrace her.","I'm studying to become a teacher at my college, I have learned so much so far. Student teaching was one of the best things I ever did in my life because I got to learn even more and it was more visual and personal. A few things for people who saw this film and don't know what I'm talking about when I say ""unrealistic"", number one rule of teaching is that you do not become that personal with students, such as inviting them to stay in your house because you feel that they are in danger. Michelle would have been fired on the spot for several things she did in the film.But still, I really liked Dangerous Minds. It really touched my heart, because I felt for Michelle's character. How hard it is to want to get into a student's life, but you can't because otherwise, you have stepped out of line. She was above the system and was truly a good person who wanted to just help her students. I loved it's message of how a person can either choose to stay down or hold their head high. I would recommend this movie, it's a tear jerker, but a decent flick and much better than today's movies.7/10"
Schitt's Creek,,8.5,"After being a victim of fraud, Johnny Rose and his family go from extremely wealthy to penniless overnight. The only asset left to them is a small, unsophisticated town: Schitt's Creek. They relocate there. Culture shock ensues.","Reviewers say 'Schitt's Creek' is acclaimed for its humor, heart, and character development. The quirky, relatable characters and their growth are frequently praised. The ensemble cast, especially Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, and Dan Levy, delivers standout performances. The writing is noted for its cleverness, wit, and balance between comedy and touching moments. Themes of love, acceptance, and family resonate deeply. The show's ability to evoke laughter and tears within episodes is highlighted. Additionally, the authentic and normal representation of LGBTQ+ characters and relationships is appreciated."
How I Met Your Father,,5.7,"Sophie and her close-knit group of friends are in the midst of figuring out who they are, what they want out of life, and how to fall in love in the age of dating apps and limitless options.","Although the 1st episode was good, 2nd ep wasn't. But in comparison to how I met your mother, this show is disappointing. Yes, I will be Watching the upcoming episodes because of Hilary. I liked that they used the same theme song of HIMYM in the starting. I really want to like this show and hope they improve it!"
Pinocchio,2022,5.1,"A puppet is brought to life by a fairy, who assigns him to lead a virtuous life in order to become a real boy.","I'm gonna be honest, I do try my best to tolerate most of the live action remakes. We only got Jungle Book as the only one worth watching, everything else are either decent or just okay. Now the movie is released, I can already see a good reason people will debate this and the 2019 Lion King. The 2022 Pinocchio remake may not be the worst Disney Plus film, but this could be the worst live action Disney remake to date. There are Pinocchio movies out there that do try to find a way to tell the story of the character well. But this is more of a recycled film from the original 1940 one. Despite it does have some of the performances that's fateful to the original film, it had a weak execution with a poorly written story, mediocre characters, overly dark setups, and awful looking visuals. The one thing I'll say the visuals got right is with Pinocchio himself. But for the most part, they can be out of place and most of the designs try way too hard to make animal characters realistic. I mean, we already gotten Ugly Sonic in Chip and Dale. What more do you want to do all that in, Disney Plus? Of course as a painfully pointless live action Disney remake, I recommend to skip this one and stick with the original film. But you know what, let's all be thankful at least we're getting the one by Del Toro at the end of the year. When that gets released, I can guarantee it will be the one you'd want to watch instead. I think Disney should take a break from remaking their classic animated films before they embarrass themselves the more that are made."
Inside Out 2,2024,7.5,"A sequel that features Riley entering puberty and experiencing brand new, more complex emotions as a result. As Riley tries to adapt to her teenage years, her old emotions try to adapt to the possibility of being replaced.","When I first heard that Pixar was making a sequel film, I was very excited as I simply adored the last one. I saw the trailer and thought that it looked good for a current movie. I went to see it with high expectations, and I came out sobbing from how personal it felt to me.For some context about me, I had terrible anxiety for years until I finally healed from it and watching the film from that perspective made it very personal. I found myself teary at a few of the lines that Anxiety said just because I had said them to myself in the past. The film portrayed accurate depictions of teenage life, from struggling to fit in, those feelings associated with friends going away, thinking less of yourself etc... One scene I found especially hard to cope with and that got me SOBBING just because it gave me time to reflect on how I used to be.Personal feelings aside, this film was really amazing. The animation was incredible, and the plot was surprisingly good. I loved the new emotions and its just as good as the first one (almost better)"
Mr. McMahon,,7.7,WWE experienced record-breaking highs and crushing lows under Vince McMahon's leadership and the mogul's controversial reign.,"""When we stop growing, we die"" is what McMahon said. It is ironic because the man has not grown emotionally since his adolescence. Paul Heyman, the voice of reason among the talking heads, said it best, that McMahon is overcompensating for the deprivation that he endured in the first 12 years of his life. He was abandoned by his biological father and severely abused by his stepfather, resulting in a core belief of defectiveness. Nothing he has ever achieved, no amount of success or adoration, will ever truly be enough to heal that inner child who still feels inadequate because daddy left him.It may be true that, without McMahon's voracious appetite to make something of himself, we would not have the behemoth that is the WWE. However, his true legacy lies in normalising domestic violence, fuelling misogyny and encouraging toxic masculinity in the storylines he conceived of to achieve ever higher ratings, including putting his own family drama on full display in his shows. What kind of person accuses his daughter of being selfish for not wanting her wedding televised on pay-per-view, and then arranges a wrestling match against him to humiliate her?Despite his insistence that Mr. McMahon is only a character, it is nevertheless one borne out of and embodying his unconscious desires, a medium through which he can express his true self with impunity. Mr. McMahon was his Get-Out-Of-Jail-Free card; ""Oh, I did something wrong? That was my character, not me"". He is not a role model to any man, not even his son, from whom he withheld affection and validation the same way that his own father did to him. This man lives in the fantasy that he does not perpetuate abuse in spite of his abusive childhood and clear evidence to the contrary. This documentary is one of abuse and the legacy of abuse, more than it is about wrestling, and it need not have been six hours long."
Space Oddity,2022,5.5,A man seeks the help from an insurance company to plan a one-way trip to Mars.,"One of the dumbest movies I've seen, has its good moments and that's all. Actors are ok, just the storyline is ridiculous, if you enjoy seeimg mental illness at play this one's for you.it had potential to be a great movie, but fails because of its ridiculous premise ! Could have been so much better if the characters and story made sense. Don't know why people have given it a good score, but must have watched something different than I did. If you like a romantic movie I guess it's ok, but the story has to make sense I would think. Has a good cast, unfortunately everything else is a miss. Time waster for sure !"
Where the Crawdads Sing,2022,7.2,A woman who raised herself in the marshes of the Deep South becomes a suspect in the murder of a man with whom she was once involved.,"Read the book. Loved it. This is not one of those reviews that says movie ruined the book. It is different in the book tho. Daisy Edgar Jones is a great actress and does nothing wrong here but is totally unlike the vision of Kya in my head. The best thing about the movie is the cinematography. With no sound this movie would be lush. The dialogue is clunky though, a lot of the supporting actors wooden particularly the love interests. The courtroom scenes are predictable. David Straitharn is great as a cut price Atticus Finch. The middle section of the movie lags and feels like a Hallmark movie , however by the end I was sucked in and left the cinema smiling.Plot synopsis without spoilers is basically a young girl fending for herself in the marshlands is charged with murder.Better than the mainstream reviews suggest."
Madame Web,2024,4.1,"Forced to confront her past, Cassandra Webb, a Manhattan paramedic that may have clairvoyant abilities, forms a relationship with three young women destined for powerful futures, if they can survive their threatening present.","... when I saw Dakota Johnson was starring in it. Naturally I can't lay the entirety of this hot mess at her feet. But there is some really bad campy acting happening on her part, reminiscent of the Fifty Shades of Grey movies in which she starred. Perhaps it was because the director was more interested in the placement of Pepsi cans than her performance, but I digress.Basically, this movie plays out like the cut scenes from a budget Xbox 360 game. From the ground up this thing just feels designed to fail. It feels almost Producersesque in its approach in just how every aspect is seemingly intentionally mangled, yet no one seems to care. How have we come so full circle to go through the glory of Infinity War/Logan/The Dark Knight to arrive all the way back to Batman and Robin and Catwoman levels of superhero flicks? (Bam!, Pow!, Gosh yes Batman!)How did this movie make it so far that it has an actual release, and no one stopped it? How did this idea get green lit? Why did Sony give 80 million and turn over their valuable IP to the people that wrote Morbius, Gods of Egypt, Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter? How did this get past the writing process and again have that script greenlit? How could no one on the set at any point stop things? How did no one in the editing room point out how bad it looked and how much of a mess it was?But to the suits it's not about art and story. Instead it's about business, and people are just a commodity. It's cheaper to recycle known quantities, and practice nepotism and involve maybe less than talented friends, people you've worked with before, than go out and find artists with worthy stories. They don't care about art, they don't care about stories, they care about making this work for them financially, regardless of loss of reputation with audiences as a whole.Youtuber Chris Stuckmann did a deep dive on the topic of big studios being generally run by folks who came up through management rather than the creative rungs such as writing and directing when he discussed this film. His take is worth watching. For some reason, Chris doesn't do critical movie reviews since he has become a filmmaker, but I can tell by his tone that, like me, he was completely displeased watching this one. I'd avoid it."
Back to Black,2024,6.3,"The life and music of Amy Winehouse, through the journey of adolescence to adulthood and the creation of one of the best-selling albums of our time.","Marisa Abela's portrayal of Amy Winehouse is a standout in an otherwise messy film. Her performance is a solid 10/10 and deserves a standing ovation.But the film itself falls short, tangled in a disjointed script that leaves the audience emotionally adrift. There's a big disconnect between the characters and the viewers, making it hard to really connect with the story. In contrast, Asif Kapadia's documentary ""Amy"" broke our hearts by offering an intimate look into the life of a woman many of us never met but felt we knew by the end.For those who don't know Winehouse's tumultuous journey, this film doesn't offer much clarity. It meanders through her life, failing to paint a clear picture of the real Amy. Despite the stellar cast, their great performances can't save the film's fragmented storytelling.The movie glosses over crucial aspects of Amy's life, simplifying her complex struggles into a narrative that lacks the emotional depth and authenticity that her story deserves."
Fresh,2022,6.7,"After quitting dating apps, a woman meets the supposedly perfect man and accepts his invitation to a romantic weekend getaway, only to find that her new paramour has been hiding some unusual appetites.","First of all, there is not a single minute of this movie that would classify it as a comedy. It is a dark and disturbing suspense/horror movie.I'm not a horror fan, but I liked this one. I had an uneasy feeling throughout the majority of it (you'll see why). The acting was better than most films of this type."
Woman of the Hour,2023,6.6,"Sheryl Bradshaw, a single woman looking for a suitor on a hit 1970s TV show, chooses charming bachelor Rodney Alcala, unaware that, behind the man's gentle facade, he hides a deadly secret.","This film does a good job of revealing the ways psychopaths often use charm to lure their victims. I appreciate the fact that the film is by no means a typical horror film or a typical psychological thriller. Most of the violent acts in this film are only portrayed via the events leading up to them (or after them), and so much of the actual violence is indirectly portrayed rather than actually being shown. It keeps things light enough -- and doesn't show enough actual violence -- in order for the film to remain watchable but at the same time, it is often very unsettling and disturbing. The scene in the parking lot after the taping of the Dating Game really perfectly conveyed the same feeling that the character played by Anna would be feeling at the time. It's as though I could literally feel her own fear and uneasiness. I think Anna's acting and directing in this film were superb, as was all of the acting in general. What I appreciate most about this film is its underlying message(s) or themes regarding how women can so easily fall prey to the darker side of the male ego and how manipulative some men can be when it comes to women, such as exploiting the innocence or vulnerability of women for their own selfish gain. I also appreciate how it shoes that society in general (and especially back then) actually encourages and often condones this kind of treatment toward women -- dehumanizing and objectifying them. And as the film shows, even intelligent women are susceptible to the charm of the psychopath -- and society alone can render them vulnerable. This message was not only delivered via the behavior and violence of ""Rodney"" but also via the behavior of a few other male characters in the film. Anyone hoping for a typical serial killer film is going to be disappointed with this one. But anyone hoping for something with more underlying depth will hopefully appreciate it."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,,8.3,"A young woman, destined to slay vampires, demons and other infernal creatures, deals with her life fighting evil, with the help of her friends.","Reviewers say 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' is lauded for its rich mythology, complex characters, and powerful themes like feminism, addiction, and grief. The blend of horror, comedy, drama, and romance is highlighted. However, criticisms include inconsistent writing, unrealistic plot points, and supernatural portrayals. Some find characters unlikable or the acting subpar. Despite these issues, many appreciate its innovative storytelling, character development, and significant cultural impact."
Beverly Hills Cop,1984,7.4,A freewheeling Detroit cop pursuing a murder investigation finds himself dealing with the very different culture of Beverly Hills.,"I must be honest, I was never interested in watching 'Beverly Hills Cop', as I was under the impression it was a slapstick comedy. Whatever made me decide to watch this, I don't know, but on the spur of the moment I opted for this movie, and I'm glad I did.I was pleasantly surprised. Not only was it actually funny (and not slapstick), it was an entertaining action movie with great stunts, good action sequences - especially the opening scene! - and darn good acting from Eddie Murphy. He was just hilarious. I loved the characters and the somewhat unusual circumstances they often found themselves in. Not only was Eddie Murphy's character, Axel Foley, funny, but his practical jokes on colleagues were also funny.To add to this, it was a really good story. I found it interesting and fun to watch all the way. I also loved the soundtrack. You gotta love those 80s action movies! 'Beverly Hills Cop' was indeed a nice surprise."
Da Vinci's Demons,,7.9,"Follows Leonardo Da Vinci during his early days in Florence, as a young artist, inventor and dreamer, trying to change the future.","To be honest, I think this show is fascinating. There are bunch of beautiful graphics, action sequences, adventures, thriller etc.. which blow your mind.This is truly an amazing show and gives the audience the entertainment factor that they deserve not the historic side of Leonardo Da Vinci.the only problem in my opinion is the pronouncement of the names. it is more of an English accent than an Italian which doesn't justify the beauty of the name. this the only annoying thing in the series so far, however we can use to it as the show goes on.my true advice, give it a try. you will not regret it. you want an entertainment you got it."
Vesz√©lyes lehet a fagyi,2022,6.5,"Two identical twins live a completely different life and see each other in quite different perspectives. One is a rich housewife with a newborn, the other is a doctor with low income, but with a sparkling new relationship.",Natasa Stork is credited two times in the trailer because she plays twins in the film.
Smallville,,7.5,"A young Clark Kent struggles to find his place in the world as he learns to harness his alien powers for good and deals with the typical troubles of teenage life in Smallville, Kansas.","Someone over at the WB must have finally pulled their head out of their A$$.Smallville, is a very intriguing, genuine, original show with intelligent characters, superb acting, excellent story lines, and the ability to be the new best show to ever come out of WB...Buffy being the first.Tom Welling shines as Clark Kent.  This virtual nobody is dynamic on the screen.  His raven colored hair, and big blue eyes, and exception physique make him perfect eye candy for anyone and everyone.  However, his acting is stand out as well as his looks.  He isn't someone that is resting on his looks to get him somewhere in Hollywood.  Though, he very well could.John Schneider is back on the small screen in a big way.  Though, the show doesn't focus on him or his character, it is good to see him in this show...as well, Annette O'Toole give a great performance as Clark's mother.Michael Rosenbaum blows up as Lex Luther.  I haven't really followed his career.  I really have only seen him in Urban Legend.  He delivers the deception, and human evil that is Lex Luther.I really think WB has stumbled onto something good.  FINALLY!!  How many garbage shows are now on, or have been cancelled from the WB.  Too many...I think they really have something here...I hope to see this show go thru the roof!10 out of 10"
"Confess, Fletch",2022,6.4,"After becoming the prime suspect in a murder, Fletch strives to prove his innocence while simultaneously searching for his girlfriend's stolen art collection.","Confess Fletch is a breezily entertaining caper with a fun cast of characters and an engaging central mystery led by the ideal person to anchor this. It's a complete story that doesn't overtly sequel bait which is exactly why it deserves one should it ever come to fruition. Just watching Jon Hamm be endlessly charming, adorable and funny is enough to sustain all 98 minutes.This is a lovely showcase for Jon Hamm's leading man talents. He's got the rare gift of being generically dashing whilst also having great comedic timing which is constantly employed for solid dry wit that never fails to get a chuckle. Even though it's his film, the supporting cast still gets plenty to work with, ensuring everyone is memorable and the film never forgets about them.Gregg Mottola's direction makes up for what it lacks in visual flair with a general playfulness, especially in the deadpan delivery and the way title cards are dropped. The tone never waivers so it always remains lighthearted and the nice pacing ensures proceedings move at a steady pace. David Arnold's retro score is the ideal choice for the lighthearted tone and fits the throwback nature of the film."
Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F,2024,6.4,Axel Foley returns to Beverly Hills after his daughter's life is threatened for a family reunion that includes old pals John Taggart and Billy Rosewood to uncover a conspiracy.,"I really wasn't expecting much. The third movie was so bad, and this one straight to streaming, I figured it would be a disaster. But it wasn't! I think if they tried to update it too much and there wasn't as much nostalgia (music, familiar characters), it would've been a flop.The story is ok, just not very strong. The action was ok, but it was a a lot of rehashing of the opening sequence of the first movie - plus, everyone is so much older now, there can't be as much running or rolling around on the floor. The humor throughout is decent, I wish there was more.The weakest of it all is the actor who played Jane. Unfortunately, she's not very good in the emoting department - she's way worse than Brigitte Nielsen was in the second movie. Anyways, it's still a decent watch if one is a fan of the originals. It's good enough to have deserved a theatrical release. Not bad at all."
Mothers' Instinct,2024,6.3,"Alice and Celine live a traditional lifestyle with successful husbands and sons of the same age. Life's perfect harmony is suddenly shattered after a tragic accident. Guilt, suspicion and paranoia combine to unravel their sisterly bond.","Set in a middle class 60's setting which is beautifully done, 2 families who are dear friends both experience unforeseen trauma in their lives which leads to a catastrophic end.I'm not a grand fan of Hathaway who plays Celine, but this pairing with Chastain who plays Alice is cinematic gold. The story follows the pair through trauma and heartbreak with an ultimate end of a perfect pairing.The film at first is slow and kind of reminds you of the old slow starting films of the 60's. But it's done so nicely that it's not onerous to follow the story being set. Slowly but surely events unfold and you realise something is happening but you're not sure what.Eventually 1 mystery is solved but it only opens up another mystery, and then another, and then another.I'd not say it kept me on the edge of my seat, but it certainly held my attention with ease. I particularly loved the way it made me feel deep sympathy with both star characters, knowing that 1 or perhaps both of them was the 'bad guy'. Then again, perhaps neither of them were and they were being manipulated by someone else...
Pitting them against one another was a great move and kept me guessing until the end.The sets and wardrobe and even the traits of people were absolutely on point for the 60's, and I loved how there was no extraneous noise affecting the main script. No police interviews, no secondary characters poking their noses in, and no grand arguments with threats and shouting. It was all very muted and yet was foreboding in it's quiet, like a great Hitchcock movie, but obviously not near as good.All in all a great story and a great film with great actors and I give it a solid 7."
The Union,2024,5.5,"Construction worker Mike is thrust into the world of espionage when his high school sweetheart, Roxanne, recruits him for a high-stakes intelligence mission.","It has become painfully clear that Hollywood is short on good writing. This movie has a ton of story to work with but instead flushes it down the toilet. To be clear it is a stylish action flick, it looks really pretty and the action scenes are fun to watch. The problem however is that the flick has employed an impressive number of A-list actors and gave them poop scripts. The only person that had any decent lines was J. K. Simmons, all the rest of the cast was wasted on a doo-doo script. It wouldn't be out of place to say this has been done before, and a lot better than this. After the plot was explained it was painfully obvious they just copy and pasted bits and pieces from other espionage movies to get this stylish looking thing on screens. It's too bad really, the story could have been worked into something much better than what the end result was. This is a watch and make fun of it while it plays movie, that could have been so much more."
Unfrosted,2024,5.5,"In 1963 Michigan, business rivals Kellogg's and Post compete to create a cake that could change breakfast forever.","Amazing actors could not have been butchered worst! Unfrosted is without a doubt among worst movies I've seen this year. It's supposed to be a comedy but draws no laughs. The premise is silly, which s ok, but the writing is as lousy as it gets. The target audience s missed completely: it's supposed to be a family movie yet falls flat both with adults and kids. Watched it with my nephews and here' what 6 and 8 year olds said: ""ewww gross"" (kids eating out of garbage scene), ""that's dangerous"" (guy putting a metal object into a toaster). Guess kids summoned it up well: ewww gross, that's dangerous."
Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children,2016,6.7,"When Jacob discovers clues to a mystery that stretches across time, he finds Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. But the danger deepens after he gets to know the residents and learns about their special powers.","Just to clarify one thing: I don't hate Tim Burton at all. In fact, I kinda love his work. He has a very unique and imaginative vision, seems to have a tasteful choice for actors (besides Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter), and can really pour his heart and soul in some of his films like ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Corpse Bride"", and ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". But, just like any director, he has his missteps also. Some of his recent work is very lackluster and, at times, flat-out bad (Planet of the... BLAHK!).But I was still excited for this particular project of his. I haven't read the book, or knew much about it, but when I saw the trailer I got my hopes up. Maybe this will be his big comeback! Asa Butterfield is an actor I like, the imagery is appropriately dream- like and the source material seems to fit his style perfectly. It even has the screenwriter from X-Men: First Class!So I went to see the film with a few of my friends in a theater of around 15 people and 25-30 recliner seats. I couldn't wait to see another great Tim Burton movie!And for the first half of the film... I genuinely enjoyed it! Sure, it does take some time for Jacob to reach Peregrine's home, but once he does... I couldn't help but smile like an idiot. The world that Jacob enters is fascinating, the visuals are exceptional, and every one of the peculiar kids are very interesting side- characters. I wanted to learn more about the girl that could lift boulders over her head! There is also this kid that can project his dreams into film... how cool! The first act always left me with questions that I was excited to hear about when the plot kicks in.And then the plot kicks in...That is where the movie starts to run out of steam.I could tell there were a lot of story elements in the book just from watching the movie, because in the second half a lot of it felt crammed in. Whenever I try to follow the story as best as I can, there's always this one subplot that makes precious little sense. It also doesn't help that the villain is weak and his motivations are somewhat vague.The climax is pretty abrupt and Burton sadly delves into a few clich√©s that aggravate me. A lot of it felt by-the-numbers at that time, and I was sorely disappointed.That's not to say that this was a bad film, because it isn't. The acting (especially from Eva Green) is competent, the whole film is imaginative in its story and visuals, and somewhere buried beneath lies a great film with lots of creative ideas and appealing whimsy. But the plot is messy, the main character is bland, the pacing is at times uneven and, in the end, it's just another average YA adaptation that had loads of potential.VERDICT:+ Visuals + Well-cast, especially for Eva Green + Imaginative + Sense of wonder in the first act + Solid directing + Interesting side charactersVillain - The hero is underdeveloped - Plot is messy - Pacing is uneven - Unconvincing love chemistrySCORE: 5.5/10"
Knight Rider,,6.9,"Follows the adventures of lone crime-fighter, Michael Knight, who fights crime and battles criminals with the help of his virtually indestructible and artificially intelligent supercar, KITT (short for Knight Industries Two Thousand).","I was a kid when Knight Rider was in its prime time and yes I watch it no matter what.  Currently have the reruns of Knight Rider on and I must say there are somethings that bug me.  Like every kid in the 80s I loved K.I.T.T. Now for all you people that say David Hasselhoff can't act come on, o.k he's not the best actor in the world but he wasn't that bad, I think he was great for the role, but the things that bug me were like how everytime Michael say something like ""K.I.T.T get Devon on the line for me"" and Michael would go and press 20 other buttons and the reuse of footage.  I must admint David Hasselhoff was good looking at the time, just about in every episode Michael would do his good dee and get the girl at the end, well they did drop to his feet, just about all apart from Bonnie, thats the only time we see Michael try so hard and get turn down, but you can see they are more then just friends.  Michael and Devon I can say are bit like Maxwell Smart and the Chief off Get Smart but the only thing was Michael was a lot smarter but it still irritated Devon like Max did the Chief.  Some episodes did a get a bit boring and could have been better, but over all Knight Rider is still a good TV series."
Gisaengchung,2019,8.5,Greed and class discrimination threaten the newly formed symbiotic relationship between the wealthy Park family and the destitute Kim clan.,"Reviewers say 'Parasite' is a complex film exploring class disparity and social inequality, praised for its unique storytelling and sharp writing. Critics commend director Bong Joon-ho and the strong cast performances. The film blends comedy, drama, thriller, and horror elements effectively. However, some reviewers find it overhyped, questioning its originality and execution. Despite mixed opinions, many agree that 'Parasite' provokes thought and discussion about societal issues."
Baywatch,,5.5,"Follows a team of lifeguards as they save lives, deal with personal dramas, fight crime and participate in over the top adventures on a daily basis on a beach in Los Angeles, California (seasons 1-9) and later Hawii (season 10 and 11).","Once the world's most-watched TV programme, Baywatch has become a significant part of television history.Okay, so it's not known for great plots (except maybe for the first few years) and brilliant acting, but, once upon a time, EVERYONE watched it.Personally, I watched most of episodes from 1990-1994, I of course, liked Pam and Yasmine, but to be honest, my favourite part of the show was the beginning theme... and I have no idea why.It's been a great stepping stone for many Californian model-type actresses, and Pam wouldn't have been as big (and I mean that in a non-boob-job kinda way) without it.I haven't seen any episodes outside of 94, but the memories I do have of the episodes I viewed were pretty good!!I don't know if it has finished in the States, and I don't really care. I've seen as many eps as I care to have sat through, and that's enough for me!""Baywatch"" R.I.P 1989-2001"
Dune: Part Two,2024,8.5,"Paul Atreides unites with the Fremen while on a warpath of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the universe, he endeavors to prevent a terrible future.","Reviewers say 'Dune: Part Two' elicits mixed reactions, with praise for its stunning visuals, exceptional cinematography, and immersive sound design. Timoth√©e Chalamet and Zendaya's performances are highly commended. However, criticisms include pacing issues, rushed climaxes, and deviations from the source material. Some viewers feel the film lacks emotional depth and tension, while others appreciate its complex world-building and philosophical themes. Overall, 'Dune: Part Two' is considered a visually impressive yet divisive addition to the sci-fi genre."
Hercules: The Legendary Journeys,,6.5,"Hercules is half-man, half-god and a hero of fantastic strength. After his malevolent stepmother, Hera, kills his wife and children, he wanders about Earth with mortal best friend Iolaus, fighting evil and trying to overcome his loss.","Xena has her moments.  Sadly, the show is mired in telling similar stories over and over again.  More than not, Xena gets into a big fight, worries about Gabriel, and espouses some platitudes about giving up fighting and finding her true path through life.  Hercules has been very inventive about killing off loved characters and exposing a mostly lay audience to different myths.  While his solutions to most dramatic situations seem trite from time to time, it is important to keep one thing in mind:  the show is camp and it doesn't have any pretentions about being something it's not.  Cartoony sounds are par for the course, if you ask me."
"Magnum, P.I.",,7.5,The adventures of a Hawaii-based private investigator.,"Magnum to me is pretty much the logical heir to Jim Rockford in the fact that many of the same themes that were so prevalent on Rockford were on this show.  Magnum to me was an ordinary guy who got caught up in extraordinary situations just like Rockford, but unlike Rockford Magnum still had many of the trappings of glamor that were associated with other detective series (ironically, Tom Selleck made several guest appearances on ""The Rockford Files"" playing the too good to be true Lance White).  The other thing that I think made him endearing is the fact that he pretty much had a regular guy persona even though he was living in the lap of luxury and even though I wasn't as big a fan of this show as I was ""Rockford"" I can still see why this show was a classic.And another thing, it wasn't just Selleck.  This show could also be seen as an ensemble with Roger Moseley as T.C., Larry Manetti as Rick and, of course, John Hillerman as the stuffy Higgins all giving wonderful supporting performances."
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,,7.9,"After getting into a fight, a streetwise teenager from a poor neighborhood in West Philadelphia, Pennsylvania is sent by his mother to live with his wealthy aunt, uncle, and cousins at their mansion in Bel-Air, Los Angeles in California.","If you grew up in the 90's then you were a fan of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air! Even if you didn't, you are still probably a fan because it's just a flat out funny show. This is where Will Smith started his career, no one knew at the time he would become the actor he is today but most saw a bright future. Now, he lost his mind at the Oscars when he slapped Chris Rock and he will always be remembered for that but that still doesn't take away from the fact that he's had a great career and this was the start. I still laugh when I watch the reruns on tv just as much as I did when I was a kid watching it."
Meet Cute,2022,5.7,"What would you do if you could travel to your loved ones' past, heal their traumas, fix their problems, and change them into the perfect partner?","I have to agree with other reviewers.. This is not a rom-com. Could be a dark comedy... But it is a (romatic?) drama. And it delivers.I can see the hate on most of the low rated reviews, not sure if towards Pete or Kaley. Looks like those viewers are expecting to chuckle with anything with Pete on it. (or Kaley for that matter).Some clearly dont event understand depression.Yes, there is a time loop here (not a spoiler), but thats not even the point of the movie. If you are trying to make sense of that, you are watching the wrong kind of movie.Most of us have suffered heartache from broken relationships. Some of us, Feeling alone. And some desperation to fit in a world that doesnt understand us.You should watch this movie knowing it is an exploration of dark emotions. It might trigger you on some topics, but im almost positive you will end with an uplifting sensation.And for those complaining of making sense... Time travel never makes sense. Thats a fact."
Xena: Warrior Princess,,6.8,"Xena, a mighty Warrior Princess with a dark past, sets out to redeem herself. She is joined by small town bard, Gabrielle. Together they journey the ancient world and fight for the greater good against ruthless Warlords and Gods.","One of the best TV shows ever.Xena: Warrior Princess is the thinking person's fantasy/action show.  A perfect mix of often dark drama, wacky/campy comedy, action, angst and romance, it was poignant, thrilling, funny, suspenseful, sexy and much more. Set in the fantasy world of a creatively reinvented antiquity, X:WP offers us the ultimate female hero: strong and vulnerable, tough and soft, brave and caring, heroic and deeply flawed, she's all warrior and all woman.  We follow Xena's journey on her quest for redemption as well as Gabrielle's growth from a naive peasant girl to a reluctant warrior.  And there are other fascinating characters: Ares, the God of War who is determined to lure Xena back to the dark side but is eventually changed by his love for her; Callisto, Xena's victim and nemesis who manages to be sympathetic even at her most evil; Joxer, the bumbling warrior wannabe with the heart of a lion.Of course the show had its weak moments, especially in the last three seasons.  At its best, however, it featured smart writing and creative directing, enhanced by the wonderful acting of Lucy Lawless as Xena, Renee O'Connor as Gabrielle, Kevin Smith as Ares, Ted Raimi as Joxer and Hudson Leick as Callisto.  (Alexandra Tydings' Aphrodite, Paris Jefferson's Athena are worthy of mention as well; so are Karl Urban as Julius Caesar and Marton Csokas as Borias, Xena's lover in her days as a warlord.)I have to comment on one of the reviews which mentioned Xena and Gabrielle being out for revenge against men and complained that the heroines beat up men all the time but never get hit themselves.  Hello?  Did this person even watch the show?  I suspect not.  Some of the most prominent villains on the show were women (Callisto, Najara, Alti), and many of Xena and Gabrielle's allies were men.  In fact, the episode ""The Dirty Half Dozen"" explicitly repudiates hostility to men.  X:WP's feminism was never anti-male or heavy-handed.Bottom line?  If you haven't seen this show, get the DVDs (or VHS) and give it a try.  Start with the premiere, ""Sins of the Past.""  The first half of S1 wasn't all that great (the show had yet to find its footing) but watch ""Hooves and Harlots"" and ""The Reckoning.""  If you're not hooked yet, try ""Ties That Bind,"" ""The Greater Good"" and ""Callisto.""  You'll probably want to stay on for S2."
After Baywatch: Moment in the Sun,,6.5,"Profiles the most-watched series on the planet Baywatch. Featuring never before seen home videos and intimate interviews with ""Baywatch"" stars, this docu-series reveals the roller coaster ride of fame for its most iconic stars.","After Baywatch actually has some really interesting material on the creation of the 1990s TV staple and the experiences the creators & actors had with it. Sadly, the Hulu doc is rendered nearly un-viable by a bloated 4-episode, 3-hour runtime.Anyone who lived through the 90s will recall Baywatch for one reason or another--it was truly a cultural phenomenon (even if objectively ""not good"") in a way that the fractured media landscape of today likely could not duplicate. As such, it is interesting to hear from the likes of David Hasselhoff, Nicole Eggert, Pamela Anderson, Alexandra Paul, and Carmen Electra (amongst many others). Most of them have at least one really interesting story or experience to share. This would have all fit perfectly into about a 90 or 100-minute standalone doc.Bafflingly, though, it is instead 3 hours over four episodes. What this leads to is a lot of filler, pointless modern-day recreations, and re-used material. I am usually laser-focused when it comes to watching content like this, but even I felt the pull of the smartphone or my attention simply wandering as this series unspooled. This glacial pace does After Baywatch no favors and actually renders the good stuff less enjoyable because so much time-wasting fills in the crevices around it.Thus, I can only go as high as 4/10 stars for After Baywatch--disappointing considering my love of everything 90s and how much I was primed to like this doc."
Irish Wish,2024,5.2,"When the love of Maddie's life gets engaged to her best friend, she puts her feelings aside to be a bridesmaid at their wedding in Ireland.","The story had really nice potential, but unfortunately it was wasted. A lot of things should be written better, it seems like some stories were suddenly cut, like something is missing. Some scenes really felt unnatural. We needed to see more of her relationship with her friends, especially her relationship with Emma.Lindsay was great as always, but she was not enough to make this movie look better. Chemistry in my opinion is very important in romcom movies and she definitely had more chemistry with Ed than Alexander that is why there should have been more scenes with him.The ending was too rushed it should have been longer and better written."
Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman,,6.7,"In addition to fighting evil, Superman has a burning romance with Lois Lane in both of his identities.","First of all, I 'm Greek, so excuse me if my English are not perfect. I read all of the comments here. The day I 'm sending this L&C's third re-run here in Greece is still continuing, but as I could see it's close to its end. Well, I have to say I 'm a BIG FAN, and I 'm glad to know there are also many fans of one of my favorite - ever TV series. I have to admit, though, L&C was not perfect. My opinion is that it was REALLY GOOD. It had a really good casting - Dean Cain (who is very handsome) is not that short, for God's sake! - and all of the actors fitted great into their roles. The script was also good, and I don't agree with the ones who said that after Lois and Clark's wedding it went bad. And of course I enjoyed the large amount of humor in it. About these flying - scenes... Well, the truth is they could be more and better. I have to say, I never was a Superman's fan, and I 've watched only one of Christopher Reeves movies. (And I liked it.) What is completely wrong for you to say (I don't mean to be rude), is that Dean Cain didn't try to make Clark Kent and Superman look different. OF COURSE HE DIDN'T!! Clark and Superman ARE the same person!! They can't be THAT different!! They have the same character, the same feelings, the same looks... because they ARE the same. They ARE one and only person. So, this is the right way for this role to be played. I agree also with this focusing in Clark's life. After all, HE is the main character. And the problems he has is what we want to see (and his struggles with the bad guys, of course), because, even if we know he doesn't really exist, we like to feel him close to our lives and feelings. If a Superman is what we need, and we can't have him in our true lives, let's just watch him! Last thing I have to say is that I would really like the idea to see Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher back as Clark Kent and Lois Lane again, to a new series or a movie. I hope I will. If I won't, though... I hope I see another Superman, because he's a really interesting idea. Congratulations to his ""inventors""."
The Tick,,7.8,"An invulnerable, somewhat dim, superhero protects The City from all manner of evil-doers.","The Tick ran on Saturday mornings for kids, but I knew of numerous adults that watched this show and loved it. The show is not for everyone, mind you. You will either understand the humor and love it, or not get it and quickly turn the channel. I was hooked on it from day one. The show had memorable characters, villains and very witty dialogue. It often left me thinking to myself that many kids were not going to get the humor because the show came off as more of a comic book satire than a kiddie show. The show did offer enough action and colorful characters to appeal to the Saturday morning crowd, though.The writers of the show, which included Tick creator Ben Edlund, really hit a bull's-eye by creating such memorable heroes like Sewer Urchin (sounded very much like Dustin Hoffman in Rainman) and Die Fledermaus and great villains like The Terror and the unforgettable Evil Midnight Bomber What Bombs At Midnight. I also felt that Townsend Coleman did a wonderful job in bringing The Tick to life. He gave The Tick some real heart and soul. This show will always be one of my all-time favorites because of its satirical humor and memorable characters. I never get tired of it. I have as much fun watching The Tick now as I did when I first saw the show in the mid 1990's."
Road House,2024,6.2,"Ex-UFC fighter Dalton takes a job as a bouncer at a Florida Keys roadhouse, only to discover that this paradise is not all it seems.","Ok fact: remakes suck.Going into this, I wanted to hate it. Remake of an 80's classic and Jake G? Recipe for disaster. But..... this is a remake in name only. Fresh story, the only connection to the original is he's a bouncer for hire. I'll admit it, this stands up on its own.For lack of anything better to watch I gave this a shot. Color me surprised but I enjoyed the heck out of it. No agenda, just an old school action movie. Now the AI/CGI was nothing short of terrible, but if you look past that this movie embodies the old school Western movies it clearly mimics (and references several times, a bit on the nose).Was I entertained? Yup. Was it Oscar worthy? No, but I'll take entertaining over Oscar Worthy every time.Give it a shot, you may just enjoy yourself."
Saltburn,2023,7.0,"A student at Oxford University finds himself drawn into the world of a charming and aristocratic classmate, who invites him to his eccentric family's sprawling estate for a summer never to be forgotten.","Reviewers say 'Saltburn' delves into class disparity, obsession, and moral ambiguity, contrasting public persona with private reality. It explores dark desires and ambition through Greek mythology, critiquing societal norms and social media superficiality. Performances by Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, and Rosamund Pike are lauded for depth. However, some find shocking scenes and pacing problematic. Cinematography and production design are praised, yet narrative and character development receive mixed feedback."
Kareem: Minority of One,2015,7.4,The life and career of the NBA's all-time leading scorer; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.,"For people outside of the USA, Kareem Abdul Jabbar was that tall basketball player who fought Bruce Lee in Game of Death or appeared as a pilot in Airplane, trying to pretend he was not the famous basketball player.When BBC television started to show US Basketball in the late 1980s, Kareem was by then a venerable veteran whose best days were behind him and it was Magic Johnson who was the man in the Lakers teamThis HBO documentary tries to delve into the man who was always rather prickly with the media. As Kareem mentions once after a bitter defeat in a school competition where he showed his emotions he later vowed to keep his game face on. That face stayed on for decades and even in this documentary we rarely get to hear what he really thinks.Kareem regrets he did not spend time with his children from his first marriage and even now it looks he is distant from them. Yet apart the words of regret we get nothing more. The Muslim sect involved in his conversion kept him having contact from his parents for many years, we get again nothing as to why he was distant from them and whether he regretted this. He fell out with a mentor Wilt Chamberlain who was very uncomplimentary about Kareem in interviews but Kareem never really gives his side of the story.Of course you get to know something about Kareem, his shyness about his size as a teenager, his early beginnings in college basketball where he soon made a name for himself, when he turned professional and of course the glory days in the 1980s with the LA Lakers who were the glamour team.You get to see Karrem enjoying his interests such as jazz, a passion inspired by his father, many valuable records he had were destroyed in a house fire. His interests in martial arts which led to a close friendship with Bruce Lee.There was also a dark side with Kareem who would sometimes lash out in the court against opponents. The film although shows his retirement tour where even rivals applauded his contribution to basketball, it kind of stops once he retired and tells us virtually nothing of what he has been up to since then. He obviously did not take up coaching, did he want to? His brush with cancer got a mere sentence.It was an interesting documentary but I always get the feeling that Kareem is still hiding in the shadows."
Red One,2024,6.3,"After Santa Claus is kidnapped, the North Pole's Head of Security must team up with a notorious hacker in a globe-trotting, action-packed mission to save Christmas.","If you saw the Rotten Tomato score you would think this was a travesty but it isnt. This is actually decent and thats coming from a person who maybe has a total of 20 movies above an 8.0.Now mind you this is not a masterpiece. For example, Klaus was a great movie. This is not at that level but it does have more action and can generally be considered an easier watch because its an action adventure. Overall id say its a solid above average flick that will make it on the holiday watch list from here on.Santa is kidnapped by the evil witch who wishes to use him as a battery to power her caper of punishing the naughty. The good guys have to rescue Santa while dealing with mythical creatures around the world.There is violence involved but its very tame. I would say its nothing like Home Alone in terms of outright violent imagery so if you are ok with that, this is no worse. The only parts that might scare your kids are the creatures but they dont come off as menacing or anything. In fact the scariest ones like Krampus come off as somewhat funny and cheesy. Campy is probably the best tone to use here.Give this one a shot and ignore the really strange user scores. I have no idea why its so bad on rotten tomatoes. Something is very wrong with critics over there with the collective 30% score. User score is 90%, just to show you how disconnected those critics were from anything sensible.Give this a shot. Its not going to blow your socks off, but its a fun holiday flick."
Carry-On,2024,6.5,A mysterious traveler blackmails a young TSA agent into letting a dangerous package slip through security and onto a Christmas Eve flight.,"Reviewers say 'Carry-On' is often likened to 'Die Hard' for its Christmas setting and action-packed plot. The film explores themes of tension, moral dilemmas, and high-stakes scenarios in an airport. Taron Egerton and Jason Bateman receive praise for their performances and chemistry. However, some critics note plot holes, unrealistic elements, and a lack of originality, arguing the film relies on familiar tropes. Despite these issues, many find 'Carry-On' to be an entertaining, fun action thriller."
Joker: Folie √† Deux,2024,5.2,"Struggling with his dual identity, failed comedian Arthur Fleck meets the love of his life, Harley Quinn, while incarcerated at Arkham State Hospital.","Reviewers say Joker: Folie √† Deux received mixed reactions, highlighting Joaquin Phoenix's and Lady Gaga's performances. The musical transformation was criticized for disrupting the original's dark tone. The plot was seen as aimless and lacking emotional depth, though some appreciated the exploration of Arthur Fleck's mental state and the Joker-Harley relationship. Pacing and predictability were frequent criticisms, yet a few reviewers valued the film's bold, unique approach."
Four Good Days,2020,6.6,A mother helps her daughter work through four crucial days of recovery from substance abuse.,Coming from someone who has worked in the addiction field in just about every capacity as well as dealt with it in my personal life I feel this is a very accurate depiction of addiction. From the conflicted mother trying not to enable her kid but not being able to trust a word that comes out of her mouth. To the addict who wants to get clean but continues to struggle despite the disgust she has for her addiction. It's so accurate it makes me cringe. Phenomenal acting. The mother trying to control every aspect of the addicts life and just falling short is just way too accurate.
Ricky Stanicky,2024,6.2,"When three childhood best friends pull a prank that goes wrong, they invent the imaginary Ricky Stanicky to get them out of trouble. Twenty years later, they still use the nonexistent Ricky as a handy alibi for their immature behavior.","Never thought that I would enjoy seeing John Cena in this raunchy comedy. I felt like he was so at par with other celebrities that oddly fit into this types of characters. His casting was a great decision to the movie because he was hilarious on this one without trying too hard. All the other characters I found a bit lame. I mean, Zac Efron was a bit bizarre to watch now because of his bulky physique that I wished he would fit into more dramatic and action roles than this one. All the other performances were lame and forgettable, and it felt like the writer was just filling-in scenes just to make the film longer."
Angel,,7.9,"The vampire Angel, cursed with a soul, moves to Los Angeles and aids people with supernatural-related problems while questing for his own redemption.","I've been following the Buffy series until the end,so when I heard of this 'spin-off' I was actually pretty psyched about it.Damn it was I wrong.This show completely blows off the doors of it's predeccesor in many ways,mainly the ambiance.It's not so cutesy as Buffy,but it has an awesome sense of humor and character development.It's really great seeing Angel change through out the show.Every character evolves,but Wesley was the most drastic change of all.He goes from a wimpy guy to this battle-hardened warrior.Everything about this show should appeal to people:awesome battles,amazing characters,incredibly funny humor,and a great,cohesive story that never seems to contradict itself.This series rocks more than anything that has ever rocked before.David Boreanaz,dude you really outdid yourself."
The Canterbury Tales,1972,6.3,"Pasolini's artistic, sometimes violent, always vividly cinematic retelling of some of Chaucer's most erotic tales.","I'm rather bemused by some of the negative comments above. This film - in my humble opinion - is one of the greatest ever made, and my personal favourite of all P.P. Pasolini's. Pasolini brings life to Chaucer in a way my poor teachers at school could never have dared. In the film, Pasolini casts himself as Chaucer; daydreaming, laughing at his own tales, being berated by his wife. And therein lies the clue to this film. It's not just an interpretation of the Canterbury Tales, it's a portrayal of its author. For all claims of ""smut"" (see above), I can honestly say that your imagination must be pretty dull not to laugh at certain earthy, dream-like scenes. Absolutely non of the scenes in this movie can be branded as bad-taste. They're absolutely accurate. Pasolini showed deep understanding of the English psyche throughout; the examples are too numerous to mention. If you're looking for an explanation of The Canterbury Tales, you won't find it in this film. But if you're looking for how to go about interpreting it for yourself, you'll find no better. This movie is one that I will keep, and you can bet my kids are going to see it when they get a little older too."
A Man Called Otto,2022,7.5,"Otto is a grump who's given up on life following the loss of his wife and wants to end it all. When a young family moves in nearby, he meets his match in quick-witted Marisol, leading to a friendship that will turn his world around.","The Producers of this film would like you to fall in love with the grumpiest man in America in ""A Man Called Otto""...even though it's a remake of a Swedish movie about their grumpiest old man based on the Fredrick Backman book, ""A Man Called Ove"".I'd be lying if I said I didn't fall for this movie, unashamedly, hook, line and sinker.I was expecting the usual something got lost in translation approach from the Americans and churned out sappy cinema, but it wasn't.Sure it plays on your vulnerable human emotions and you'd have to be made of stone or even more cynical than me not to get the feels as the cool kids say.I admit that to date I haven't read the book or seen the original Euro version that was the highest grossing foreign film of 2016 in the US, so I don't have those reference points, but what I do know is the Hollywood version deals with some very contemporary issues of social media, transgender and unscrupulous property development well.The story goes, despite being deposed as head of his gated community (over a valid issue) our grumpy 60 something retiree Otto continues to watch over his neighbourhood with an iron fist.Checking the gates are closed to through traffic including slimy property developers, also sorting out parking permits and recycling bins on his daily rounds.When a pregnant new neighbour and her family (including dim witted husband and two gorgeous daughters) move into the house opposite Otto and a stray cat lands on his door step, it sets off a chain of events that changes his life for the better (mostly).Tom Hanks is ""Otto"" and is brilliant in his own understated acting style.He's got to be Oscar bait for this moving role.Any lesser American actor could have turned this film into a schmaltzy, sugar coated affair.Otto will make you laugh, cry and sigh so pack some tissues.""A Man Called Otto"" is a beautiful love story retold in timely flashbacks from the present to the past that don't jump all over the place like some movies do leaving you feeling disoriented.Hanks real life son, Truman, plays ""Otto"" in his youth.As the movie progresses you learn where the pain comes from in his life as he opens up like a box of chocolates.This is my first film review for 2023 and if the rest of this years flicks can be this damn fine I'll be a happy camper.""A Man Called Otto"" has set the bar high for everything that follows.This is a must see movie for anyone with a big heart."
The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Three More,2024,7.1,Four tales unfold in writer-director Wes Anderson's anthology of short films adapted from Roald Dahl's beloved stories.,"These four short stories are brilliant. With Wes' style it's like a match made in heaven. The stories almost feel like bed time stories. And the cast choice was superb. The only member i didnt like was Richard Ayoade, just because his lifeless acting and voice annoys me üòÇ. First time watching all these in the big combined filmStory 1 - ' The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar', was great seeing Benedict in a Wes production. And the arc it took was supering interesting.Story 2 - 'The Swan', was effortlessly told by Rupert Friend. Never seen him before, very talented.Story 3 - 'The Rat Catcher', Ralph finnes at his best. Diving into this character, creepy, the voice, costume and mannerismsStory 4 - 'Poison', was brilliant as Dave Patel & Bendicts chemistry was great. Would love to see these two together for future wes productions. Was quite comical which I loved."
White Boy Rick,2018,6.5,"The story of teenager Richard Wershe Jr., who became an undercover informant for the FBI during the 1980s and was ultimately arrested for drug-trafficking and sentenced to life in prison.","I went to see this with an open mind as the reviews were mixed. I actually enjoyed the movie. Yes, some parts were slow but this is not Infinity Wars people (the Marvel generation wants an explosion or murder every 2 minutes). I actually found the dad's character as the most believable. His struggles in life and poor decision making was the actual catalyst for most of the stuff that went on. I say go see it for yourself. May not be a date movie but definitely a guy movie for sure."
Sonic the Hedgehog 2,2022,6.5,"When Dr. Robotnik returns with a new partner, Knuckles, in search of an emerald that has the power to destroy civilizations, Sonic teams up with his own sidekick, Tails, on a journey across the world to find the emerald first.","Many sequels go bigger but end up being worse than the original. They lose the essence of what made the original good. That's definitely not the case here. It's much bigger but feels just like the first movie. It's on par with the original in every way, just bigger.I said this in my review of the first movie, every moment Jim Carrey is on screen is pure gold. I wanted him to be in every scene. His facial expressions are hilarious. Whoever cast him as Robotnik is a genius. It's so perfect. I can't imagine it being anyone else.My only downsides are a few gaps in logic and parts that don't really make sense. I chalked it up to being a kids movie but that's not really an excuse. And was I the only one who thought Idris Elba was doing something weird with Knuckles' accent? It sounded like it was switching between an English accent and a heavy New York accent, and sometimes a combination of both. I couldn't stop hearing it.I had a great time with this movie. Two out of two in the videogame genre??? That's unheard of. Keep up the good work. Maybe this is the tide turning on video game movies like it did with superhero movies in the early 2000's. I can only hope.(3 viewings, opening night 4/8/2022, 4/27/2024, 12/19/2024)"
Trigger Warning,2024,4.6,"A special forces commando returns to her hometown after her father's sudden death, only to run afoul of a violent gang when she starts asking questions.","This is not good! It's actually pretty boring; I stopped watching right after she escaped from jail. I always laugh when there's a scene of a so called tough female as petite as Jessica and she's being punched in the face by a man that looks like he's almost 200 lbs. Then after a few hard blows, we see a couple of minor bruises on her face and she's still conscious and able to utter a few words. He even gave her a few solid body shots and she handled them like a boss. But it's just a movie right. The script is bad; the story is all over the place. Jessica looks as lovely as ever, but she shouldn't have been cast for this role; she doesn't fit the part."
Babylon,2022,7.1,"A tale of outsized ambition and outrageous excess, it traces the rise and fall of multiple characters during an era of unbridled decadence and depravity in early Hollywood.","Babylon is a long, messy, repulsive, and magnetic spectacle. Unfortunately despite the great performances and set pieces it doesn't live up to Chazelle's previous work.The movie wants to bring you down into the waste yard that is Hollywood then pull you out to see the beauty that grows out of the trash. The problem is the movie spends so much time in the mud, and goes so deep into it that by the time it tries to pull you out at the end it's too late.On the upside the cast are great and almost completely carry the movie, especially Margot Robbie's enthralling performance as Nellie. And as with Chazelle's previous work the set pieces are well executed and (some) characters are memorable.However, these positives could not completely overcome the movie's fundamental flaws which are -- going too far with trying to revolt the audience (to the point of childishness), not spending enough time with the characters or important scenes despite its decadent runtime, and the ending coming off as completely pretentious in the context of how practical/cynical everything leading up to it was.In the end, Babylon does serve its purpose as an entertaining spectacle, but like the Hollywood it critiques, its self-indulgence prevents it from achieving greatness."
Raya en de laatste draak,2021,7.3,"In a realm known as Kumandra, a re-imagined Earth inhabited by an ancient civilization, a warrior named Raya is determined to find the last dragon.",Raya and the Last Dragon is the most spectacularly meh film I think I've ever watched. Cool world. Boring characters. Ok story. Awful pacing.
The Rat Catcher,2023,6.5,"In an English village, a reporter and a mechanic listen to a rat catcher explain his clever plan to outwit his prey.","The Ratcatcher lacks the emotional weight of the other Roald Dahl shorts but it remains a beautifully crafted short film that contrasts its visual beauty with a generally creepy nature and some unexpectedly violent imagery in its closing moments.Making up for being underutilised in Henry Sugar, Richard Ayoade gets so much more here as the narrator and fulfils the missed potential. Between his funny yet off-putting Ratcatcher and once again closing the short as Dahl himself, Ralph Fiennes shows his incredible versatility.Wes Anderson continues to craft beautiful worlds and briefly returns to his stop motion skills. As with Poison, he also continues to break some new ground with these, using his usual style to showcase some impressive horror sensibilities."
The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,2023,7.4,"Chronicles a variety of stories, but the main one follows Henry Sugar, who is able to see through objects and predict the future with the help of a book he stole.","I'm watching a pop-up storybook; colors, editing, and composition are stylish and adorable. However, actors read lines too fast. I'm out of breath just by watching. I'm not sure Anderson was intentional to daze the audience, but it does not work on short films. The audience is ready to engage and focus at least for forty minutes. It might have worked in a two-hour film.I'm watching a pop-up storybook; colors, editing, and composition are stylish and adorable. However, actors read lines too fast.

100% Wolf,2020,5.6,"100% Wolf centers on Freddy Lupin, heir to a proud family line of werewolves. Positive he'll become the most fearsome werewolf ever, Freddy is in for a shock when his first ""warfing"" goes awry, turning him into a ferocious - poodle.",This film was more enjoyable than the reviews portrayed. Our 5 year old enjoyed it and so did his dad :-)
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2024,7.5,"After being snatched from the Green Place of Many Mothers, while the tyrants Dementus and Immortan Joe fight for power and control, the young Furiosa must survive many trials as she puts together the means to find her way home.","Reviewers say 'Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga' provides an in-depth look at Furiosa's backstory, featuring impressive visuals and thrilling action scenes. Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth receive acclaim for their performances. However, some critics argue it doesn't match the excitement of 'Mad Max: Fury Road', citing pacing problems, excessive CGI use, and weak character development. Despite these issues, the film is considered a valuable franchise addition, enriching the lore and delivering a captivating origin tale."
It Ends with Us,2024,6.3,"When a woman's first love suddenly reenters her life, her relationship with a charming, but abusive neurosurgeon is upended and she realizes she must learn to rely on her own strength to make an impossible choice for her future.","Reviewers say 'It Ends with Us' explores love, trauma, and domestic abuse, with mixed reactions. Positive reviews praise Blake Lively's performance, the films visual appeal, and the fact it's a fairly faithful adaptation. Criticisms include superficial themes, inconsistent tone, and lack of character depth. Some appreciate the handling of domestic violence, while others feel it is glossed over. The lead actors' chemistry and pacing receive varied feedback. Overall, it is a visually appealing film with strong performances, but its sensitive theme handling and tonal inconsistencies may leave some unsatisfied."
Adam Sandler: Love You,,6.7,"Adam Sandler hits the stage for a thrillingly unpredictable comedy special featuring songs, jokes, party-crashing dogs and plenty of love.","The bad: it lasts too long, it just does, 30 minutes or even 45 minutes would have been perfect, but I got bored after a while, because after the 10th s)*t and s*x joke they started to sound the same.There is no dramatic arch in this performance. Heck no, it's just random s*x and s(*t jokes. NONstop. NO story. NO message. That's okay but you better make sure those s*x jokes are really good then, but unfortunately they were more of the kind of jokes teenagers would make. Can be fun for once or twice, but not for 75 minutes on end.This material must have been an actual debut performance because Adam Sandler was constantly laughing about his own jokes, up to a point that it became embarrassing becausing he was laughing harder about his own (s*x) jokes than the audience.Not any good? What was really to like though was hearing Adam Sandler play the acoustic guiter, the bass guitar and the electric guitar. This guy can really play! I am not kiddin'. He can not sing though, he sounds awful, but that's only contributing to the comical effect of his short songs which are basically long (s*x) jokes.For sure this is definitely not the greatest stand up performance, but not terrible either. Should have been cut shorter though, because I got BORED."
Becs√∫sz√≥ szerelem,2021,6.1,"A hardcore soccer ultra, Gyula, and his wife, Mariann, long for a baby. But it turns out that Gyula is sterile and when their plans to adopt also go up in smoke, Mariann does a deal behind her husband's back: they will take in the soon to be born child of a young Roma woman.

Nosferatu,2024,7.2,"A gothic tale of obsession between a haunted young woman and the terrifying vampire infatuated with her, causing untold horror in its wake.","Reviewers say 'Nosferatu' is lauded for its visuals, gothic atmosphere, and strong performances by Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsg√•rd. The film's meticulous detail and haunting score are appreciated, though some find the pacing slow and story unoriginal. Themes of isolation and obsession are well-explored, but narrative clarity is criticized. Practical effects enhance the immersive experience, yet the film's length is seen as tedious by some."
Star Trek: Voyager,,7.9,"Pulled to the far side of the galaxy, where the Federation is seventy-five years away at maximum warp speed, a Starfleet ship must cooperate with Maquis rebels to find a way home.","The universe of Star Trek has done something brilliant to keep alive.  The creators have imposed a story arch for all the series starting with DS9. Don't get me wrong.  TNG was what got me into Star Trek in the first place. It had vibrant characters, unique ideas, and was the building block for setting the stage for the other series and the later movies.  However, in all it's glory, it lacked something.  Continuity.  The longest the crew of the Enterprise D would have to deal with an immediate situation, was no more than 2 episodes.  No doubt things would reoccur, but it was seldom. Voyager, however, would have numerous back to back episodes dealing with something.  And that might even resurface somewhere down the line.I can't understand what people dislike so much about this show.  They explored so much more than any of the others.  Not just in the unverse, but with the crew.  They all grew.  Some more than others, but you can't go 7 years and not show growth in a character.  And as with every other Star Trek, it was rough at first, but it gets so much better once the writers and the actors have about a year or two to get it right.I truely believe that if people give it a chance and don't jump on the bandwagon, they'd like it.  It's easy to say you don't like something if you've never really given it a chance."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,,8.7,"Set almost 100 years after Captain Kirk's 5-year mission, a new generation of Starfleet officers sets off in the U.S.S. Enterprise-D on its own mission to go where no one has gone before.","Reviewers say 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' delves into themes of humanity, ethics, and diplomacy, presenting intricate moral dilemmas. The series boasts a diverse ensemble cast, including Captain Picard and Commander Riker, whose relationships and growth are pivotal. Key dynamics, like Picard mentoring Wesley and Data's bond with Geordi, enrich the narrative. Balancing episodic adventures with overarching plots, such as the Borg threat and Romulan politics, the show captivates with its depth and character-driven storytelling."
Heart Eyes,2025,6.1,"When two coworkers have to survive the Heart Eyes Killer on Valentine's Day, the two have to find out who it is.","Reviewers say 'Heart Eyes' is a creative mix of romantic comedy and slasher horror, featuring a serial killer targeting couples on Valentine's Day. Praised for its inventive kills and engaging performances, the film's self-aware humor and lead actors' chemistry are highlighted. However, some find the romance and comedy overdone, diminishing suspense. Pacing, plot twists, and genre balance receive mixed reactions, with some appreciating its homage to classic slashers and others criticizing predictability and lack of originality."
All About the Levkoviches,2024,6.9,A generous and stubborn elderly boxing coach who gets along with everyone except his own son. They're reunited after the death of the old man's wife and forced to face old grievances.,"I loved every bit of this movie. A well balanced, superbly written story that speaks to the viewer on multiple levels. The acting, setting, dialogues are all authentic, just like the players, who all, without exception, deliver outstanding performances.There's also a lot to learn here about orthodox Jewish rituals but don't be misled: while these scenes are very important, for more than one reason in this film, this story is not trying to be a showcase of what's what in Jewish religion.A deep, emotionally supercharged, laugh and cry experience: that's what the Levkoviches have given me. Thank you so much. I look forward to future works of director √Åd√°m Breier."
Paul,2011,6.9,Two English comic book geeks traveling across the U.S. encounter an alien outside Area 51.,"When they were promoting Paul, I had heard Pegg and Frost discussing the film and they made a comment regarding the fact that nobody was just going to give them 50 million dollars and let them do whatever they wanted to do at risk of a loss. Also in their minds I would guess was the fact that colleague Edgar Wright had been given freedom to make Scott Pilgrim which, although really good, didn't perform box office wise. As a result of this comment I was sort of prepared for this film not quite to be as British or as smart as their previous work on things like Hot Fuzz and of course Spaced; turned out I was right to be ready for this but wrong to assume it would make a bad movie.Paul isn't a bad movie at all, it is just a pretty average and mainstream one. The laughs are solid and the action enjoyable but it does rather lack edge and bite when it has the opportunity to do so. Instead it seemed much more mainstream and easy than I expected it to be. The film really only takes shots at far right Christian extremism and they probably weren't going to be queuing up for this film in the first place. Outside of this the film goes for good general laughs so we have a rude alien who is essentially Seth Rogen and lots of action with comedy blended in ‚Äì and it gets these good general laughs and produces a perfectly fine mainstream comedy. Sci-fi references are throughout the film but even these are hardly very clever or obscure (even my girlfriend got most of them); I still found them funny but again I got the feeling that the film was trying to make sure that it was as broadly appealing as possible, as opposed to the slightly more arch comedy that the two have done previously.It does still work though because I laughed more than I expected to and even when I didn't it had a broadly amusing tone to it that entertained me and kept the mode consistent. A big part of this is that Rogen's Paul actually works well. Primarily as an effect he is great because you quickly forget he is an effect. Secondly though he works because he is likable and funny ‚Äì and I say this as someone who can take or leave Seth Rogen's limited range. He is a good character and he has good presence. Pegg and Frost play it safe mostly. Pegg appears to be channelling Ricky Gervais' awkwardness but not to as much success ‚Äì he is good but he has been better elsewhere. Frost plays his usual shaggy-dog character and he also does reasonably well with it even if some of his material isn't up to much. Wiig is nice in support and her unconvincing cursing is very convincing. Bateman was enjoyable as ever (he deadpans up there with the best of them), Weaver allows for several good sci-fi references and the support cast feature turns from Lynch, Tambor, Koechner and a few others doing solids.Overall I expected little from Paul but yet it was funny and enjoyable. The laughs were solid but outside of them it kept its tone well and made for a mostly safe and enjoyable mainstream comedy. I hope that both Pegg and Frost benefit from it though ‚Äì and benefit in terms of a little bit more trust and freedom because Spaced, Hot Fuzz, Shaun and so on all show they can produce classics when given the chance. Paul is not one of their classic but by all means it is a really enjoyable mainstream comedy."
Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy,2025,6.6,"After jumping back into the dating pool, single mother Bridget Jones finds herself caught between a younger man and her son's science teacher.","Reviewers say 'Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy' delves into mature themes of grief and loss, with Ren√©e Zellweger delivering an authentic and profound performance. While praised for its emotional depth, the film is criticized for relying on familiar tropes and lacking the charm of earlier installments. The romantic subplots and new characters are deemed less engaging, and some find the film overly sentimental and formulaic. Despite these drawbacks, many appreciate its heartfelt moments and the return of beloved characters."
Back in Action,2025,5.9,Former CIA spies Emily and Matt are pulled back into espionage after their secret identities are exposed.,"Reviewers say 'Back in Action' offers a blend of action, comedy, and family themes. The chemistry between Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx is praised, but the plot is deemed predictable and the humor uninspired. Some enjoy its light-hearted nature, while others find it unoriginal. Glenn Close and Andrew Scott receive mixed reactions. CGI and stunts are criticized, though visual effects get some commendation. Overall, it‚Äôs an entertaining yet uninspired film relying on star power."
Nutcrackers,2024,5.5,"In the most unlikely of places, four siblings find a loving shelter in an unexpected turn of circumstances. This endearing comedy-drama draws inspiration from actual events and deftly crafts a gripping story that unites everyone.","I really do not understand the harsh reviews. This is a sweet film. Not a typical Christmas film maybe, but also nothing groundbreaking. The boys, all real life brothers, are excellent. I didn't think they were obnoxious characters as other reviewers have suggested, just young kids grieving the loss of both parents! It's not too cheesy or schmaltzy, I laughed out loud a few times (it's gently funny rather than hilarious). This was my first Christmas film of 2024 and a nice gentle one to start the season off. I suppose people expect more lights and music and adventure, plus general cheesiness with a ""Christmas"" film so perhaps that's is why eating are bad. It's just a nice Sunday afternoon type film. I enjoyed it. Only real criticism is zero diversity. Not really any excuse for that these days."
Kinds of Kindness,2024,6.5,"A man seeks to break free from his predetermined path, a cop questions his wife's demeanor after her return from a supposed drowning, and a woman searches for an extraordinary individual prophesied to become a renowned spiritual guide.","It was 3 hours of nonsense that could've been cut down into a Netflix short, although it was more watchable when it didn't take itself so seriously and had more humour like in the first segment. Emma Stone sank the whole thing in the final 2 hours.The movie works when it's approaching the surrealism of a Bu√±uel film, e.g. Exterminating Angel, but then in the final couple segments it devolved into long scenes of Emma Stone randomly talking to people about dogs on an island, or trying to raise the dead, with stiff line delivery.The director punctuates the boredom with random acts of violence, orgies, nudity, and animal abuse.It was at the 2 hour mark where I wondered if this is really what the Hollywood elite does on their off-time, and they made a home movie about their debauchery as a tax write-off for Fox Searchlight. We did get to see a very nice yacht and some houses that probably belonged to one of the producers."
Subservience,2024,5.4,"Follows a struggling father who purchases a domestic SIM to help care for his house and family, unaware she will gain awareness and turn deadly.","Reviewers say 'Subservience' offers a thought-provoking exploration of AI ethics but is marred by a predictable plot and reliance on sci-fi tropes. Megan Fox's performance as the AI robot is widely praised for its believability and depth. However, the film faces criticism for its clich√© storyline, pacing issues, and underdeveloped characters. Despite these flaws, the concept and Fox's performance make it an entertaining watch, though it is often compared unfavorably to similar films like 'M3GAN' and 'Ex Machina'."
I'm Still Here,2024,8.2,A woman married to a former politician during the military dictatorship in Brazil is forced to reinvent herself and chart a new course for her family after a violent and arbitrary act.,"Reviewers say 'I'm Still Here' is an emotional film tackling love, loss, and political repression. Fernanda Torres' performance is lauded, and the film's emotional depth and historical context are appreciated. Cinematography and direction are praised for their immersive quality. However, some find the film slow-paced and lacking dramatic tension, criticizing its reliance on historical context over narrative depth. Despite mixed views on pacing and narrative, the film is generally valued for its emotional resonance and significant historical message."
Kinda Pregnant,2025,4.9,"When Lainy's plan to settle down and start a family falls apart, she puts on a fake baby bump, tells a lie and accidentally falls for her dream guy.","""Kinda Pregnant"" tries to be a funny and lighthearted movie, but it just doesn't work. The story is very predictable, so you always know what's going to happen next. There are no surprises, and everything feels like something you've seen before.The jokes aren't funny at all. Most of them feel forced, and instead of making you laugh, they just make you cringe. It's like the movie is trying too hard to be funny, but it completely misses the mark.The main actress makes it even worse. Her acting is way too over-the-top, and instead of being fun to watch, she's just annoying. It's hard to sit through the movie because her performance is so exaggerated.Overall, Kinda Pregnant is not a movie worth watching. It's predictable, not funny, and the acting is just too much. There are way better comedies out there."
√âs mi van Tomival?,2024,7.0,"Two alcoholics search for their friend who seems to have disappeared, while trying to stay sober in a country where drinking is widely accepted as a daily practice.","In Hungary, an estimated 10% of the population has some degree of alcoholism, yet the subject is somewhat taboo. Nothing demonstrates this better than the fact that this movie claims to be the first to deal with the topic... but it would still be highly recommended to watch, even if that weren't the case.First of all, we see some world-class acting, notably from the main character, Sanyi (Szabolcs Th√∫r√≥czy). His transformation from a happy drunkard to a life-threatening monster is one of the strongest performances I've seen lately. I was totally surprised when I learned that Sanyi's repairman friend wasn't even an actor-his character was incredibly believable. Also, Hungarian viewers will surely enjoy the brief appearance of stars like Gy√∂rgy Cserhalmi.Secondly, the characters are well-written. Even though alcoholism might seem like a ""simple affair,"" Sanyi's dependence is explained from multiple angles.Finally, the movie authentically presents the current mood of Hungary and Budapest, with places like that shabby CBA on the corner or the iconic Sz√©ll K√°lm√°n t√©r.Sometimes, the urge to cover ""everything"" about alcoholism makes the story feel a bit forced, but for the most part, it's a movie that immerses the viewer and hopefully makes them see the subject in a different light.And yes, on top of all that, it's an important one as well. Even if you only walk away understanding that you shouldn't get offended the next time someone refuses to drink with you, that would be a big achievement."
Futni mentem,2024,7.0,"Mother and daughters take on marathon relay after husband/father's death to honor his wish. Unprepared physically and mentally, their attempt creates ripples affecting relatives and friends, compounding challenge.","This film isn't going to change the world, but it carries some beautiful messages about various themes, such as grief, giving up, and commitment. The story has a nice arc, though it's quite grounded and nothing particularly awe-inspiring.Perhaps for the first time in a Hungarian film, the child actor outperforms some of the adults.Aside from a few very minor surprises, the whole story is fairly predictable after the first 15 minutes, but still it has nice moments.In my opinion, this film was made for a primarily female audience in mind. As a man, I found it harder to relate to the characters and their struggles, but it is okay."
Damsel,2024,6.1,"A dutiful damsel agrees to marry a handsome prince, only to find the royal family has recruited her as a sacrifice to repay an ancient debt.","Not sure why all the hate. Is it for everybody. No. But. For what it is and intends to be. It is quite good. Elodie is not a Mary Sue. She is not perfect. Not all knowing. And. She has an arc and growing pains in her story. I will be the first to admonish companies like Disney and the Ilk for interpreting beloved characters for modern audiences. This movie does none of that. It has created a heroin that has to use her wits and smarts to win and conquer her setbacks. In a good way there are cringe lines and
moments. But. For the most part. It's good writing and it serves the story. I know we have been fooled once too many times. But. This is not one of those. The acting is good for what the story needs. We need to be accepting of new takes on old stories. As long as they don't try to change a beloved story or character to push their message or what their beliefs are. Again. Not for everyone. It is enjoyable."
Black Bag,2025,6.7,"When intelligence agent Kathryn Woodhouse is suspected of betraying the nation, her husband - also a legendary agent - faces the ultimate test of whether to be loyal to his marriage, or his country.","Full disclosure: when I first saw the trailer for Black Bag, I wasn't impressed. In fact, I was even less impressed when I assumed it was just another run-of-the-mill spy thriller about agents hell-bent on destabilising Moscow.Boyyyyy, was I wrong.This film is an absolute class act - an intelligent, gripping espionage drama that had me hooked from start to finish. Cate Blanchett and Michael Fassbender deliver powerhouse performances, balancing raw intensity with the kind of nuance that elevates the film beyond your standard spy fare. Their chemistry is electric, and every moment between them crackles with tension.The supporting cast is just as strong, with Naomie Harris, Reg√©-Jean Page, and Pierce Brosnan adding layers of intrigue and depth. The dialogue is razor-sharp, and the script is packed with twists and turns that never feel forced - just expertly crafted storytelling at its finest.Steven Soderbergh is in his element here, blending sleek cinematography with a tight, sophisticated narrative. It's stylish, smart, and effortlessly cool. If you think you know what to expect from Black Bag, think again. This is espionage cinema at its absolute best."
Lightyear,2022,6.1,"While spending years attempting to return home, marooned Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear encounters an army of ruthless robots commanded by Zurg who are attempting to steal the fuel source of his ship.","Reviewers say 'Lightyear' is a visually stunning space adventure with strong themes of teamwork and emotional time travel. Chris Evans' performance as Buzz Lightyear is lauded, though Tim Allen's original voice is missed by some. Sox, the robotic cat, provides humor and charm. Despite pacing issues and convoluted plot elements, the film's heartfelt moments and inclusivity, are appreciated."
Andrew Schulz: Life,2025,7.6,"Filmed at NYC's Beacon Theatre, Andrew Schulz's new comedy special covers his experiences with starting a family and going through IVF treatments","**Review of Andrew Schulz's New Netflix Comedy Special, *Life***Andrew Schulz's new comedy special *Life* on Netflix is a whirlwind of sharp wit, brutal honesty, and laugh-out-loud moments that leave you wanting more. From the first minute, it's clear that Schulz has perfected his craft, diving into topics that are universally relatable but also hilariously bold. It's rare to see a comedian who can strike the perfect balance between raw, unfiltered commentary and intelligent humor, but Schulz pulls it off effortlessly.What's most impressive about *Life* is Schulz's ability to make you think while simultaneously making you laugh. He addresses everything from relationships, societal expectations, and everyday struggles to the absurdities of modern life with a keen, unapologetic perspective. His delivery is electric, his timing impeccable, and his energy on stage is contagious, ensuring that the audience is hooked from start to finish.Schulz's storytelling is masterful, making even the most unconventional topics feel relatable and accessible. There's a vulnerability to his approach that resonates deeply, even as he's cracking jokes that make you cringe and laugh in equal measure. It's a comedy special that doesn't shy away from pushing boundaries, but does so in a way that feels fresh and authentic rather than forced or mean-spirited.The production value is top-notch, capturing the energy of the crowd and the intensity of Schulz's performance in a way that adds another layer to the experience. The intimacy of the special makes you feel like you're right there with him, experiencing every punchline firsthand.In conclusion, *Life* is more than just a comedy special-it's an event. Andrew Schulz proves once again why he's one of the best voices in comedy today. If you're looking for something that's both hilarious and thought-provoking, this special is a must-watch. It's honest, it's daring, and most importantly, it's *funny*. Prepare to laugh until your sides hurt-Schulz is at the top of his game!"
She Came to Me,2023,6.0,A composer who suffers writer's block rediscovers his passion after an adventurous one-night stand.,"This film gives me hope that there are still writers/actors/producers out there who understand what I need in a movie. I'm NOT the demographic anymore. So Gems like this are hard for me to find.The film is unique! With a tugboat, (with female captain) opera theater, (with composer) and a psychiatrist with O. C. D.I LOVED the characters. Imperfect but well intended characters who each come to a greater awareness of what is needed to be more fulfilled and happy.This film has heart. It's subject matter about real emotions set in a quirky set of circumstances is very relatable and heartwarming. Reminiscent of good ole fashioned story telling that touches the soul.Something I desperately needed.P. S./added edit.....I was unfamiliar with the director, Rebecca Miller. Without making any connections, I had actually seen one of her movies years ago that I thought was brilliant with Daniel Day Lewis. And am now, halfway thru her 2016 movie. She has a very clear point of view. And it's very relatable to me as a woman who has said and thought some of the same ideas that Ms. Miller explores in her movies. I'm such a fan!!! Looking forward to catching up on her past films and hope she has more coming!"
The Forgiven,2021,6.1,"A fatal accident disrupts the lives of Western visitors to a lavish party in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco, and will ultimately lead to a reckoning in the desert.","Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The writer takes two extremes of western and arab culture - represented here by a group of hedonist aristocrats and a desert tribe - and uses an incident that brings them together to examine how they interact. The core of the story is the interaction between dignity and honour culture, and we see how good men can be swayed to both good and bad acts by the influence of their respective value systems. The film neither patronises the viewer nor indulges in self-regard. The dialogue snaps along and the cast deliver authentic performances - there are no phone-ins here."
Strange World,2022,5.7,The legendary Clades are a family of explorers whose differences threaten to topple their latest and most crucial mission.,"Reviewers say 'Strange World' delves into family dynamics, generational relationships, and environmentalism, stressing the importance of environmental respect and personal growth. It's applauded for underscoring inclusivity and representation through diverse characters and relationships. Performances are generally praised, but the environmental message is seen as somewhat heavy-handed by some."
De dood van Stalin,2017,7.3,"Moscow, 1953. After being in power for nearly 30 years, Soviet dictator, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, takes ill and quickly dies. Now the members of the Council of Ministers scramble for power.","Taking his lead from the farcical absurdity which he has always done so well, director Iannucci turns to Soviet politics and the days after the death of Stalin. In doing so he produces a film that seems like a bit of a hard sell; truth be told it took me a minute to be motivated to watch it on the basis that it didn't ""sound"" good. From the opening scenes though, the tone is clear and strong. The uneasy actions of the inner circle are played out in a ""relaxed"" meal, while at the same time an entire orchestra frantically try to save their own lives by simply complying with a request from Stalin. These opening scenes are funny and absurd but yet they have a genuine menace and fear to them.It is hard to describe but neither of these aspects undercut the other. The film manages to work as it plays out a massacre but yet has wonderfully funny dialogue and performances. This combination is deftly balanced and I wish I even had the skill to explain it, far less do it. The cruelty of the clamber for power, and the ruthless callousness of those who have it is chilling even as you laugh, but it is the laughter that is more impressive. The absurd but witty dialogue, combined with plenty of genuinely funny comedic touches in the small details (the accents, the pyjamas, the phrasing), all make the film very funny and had laughs where I least expected it at times. The cast are well served with the material, and are very good at making the most of it. Buscemi, Tambor, Beale, McLoughlin, Palin, Whitehouse, Friend, Isaacs, and really all the cast get the tone of the film just right. The comedic timing is spot on for all, but so too are the performances of men scheming and manipulating all the time while knowing the firing squad may be just around the corner.Well worth watching. It has moments as funny as Thick of It etc, but yet has a darkness that makes it much more satisfying and engaging to watch."
Bert Kreischer: Lucky,2025,6.3,"Comedian Bert Kreischer's fourth Netflix special covers his weight loss journey, family stories, and advice from Snoop Dogg, while reflecting on his lucky life experiences.","I've always been a fan of Bert. I have even seen him live, and have cried from laughter by the end of his set. I usually like his work but this one in particular was brutal. Talking about masturbating during a set is funny the first 3 times you do it, but by the 40th, it's just plain stupid. I feel like he's failing to evolve as a comedian. I don't mind the frat boy act and crudeness at all, but the jokes aren't hitting like they used to. I've also heard him on podcasts lately and seen him during the Super Bowl doing media work, and it's been pretty awkward. I really hope his future work is better."
Conclave,2024,7.4,"When Cardinal Lawrence is tasked with leading one of the world's most secretive and ancient events, selecting a new Pope, he finds himself at the center of a web of conspiracies and intrigue that could shake the very foundation of the Catholic Church.","Reviewers say 'Conclave' is lauded for its strong performances, especially Ralph Fiennes, and its stunning cinematography and production design. The film delves into political intrigue within the Catholic Church, exploring themes of tradition versus modernity and moral complexities. However, it faces criticism for its controversial and divisive ending, deemed unrealistic and politically motivated by many. Some argue this ending undermines earlier strengths, leaving a mixed impression. Concerns also arise about the portrayal of the Church and its characters, with accusations of oversimplification and stereotyping. Despite these issues, 'Conclave' is considered an engaging and thought-provoking film."
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,2024,6.5,"When their late police captain gets linked to drug cartels, wisecracking Miami cops Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett embark on a dangerous mission to clear his name.","So I was left a little disappointed after the last film, something just seemed to be missing but this really hit the spot.The 2 central characters still have great chemistry, but this felt a lot more like an ensemble piece with more fleshed out characters around them. I'm just going say #Reggierocks.Some great cinematography with lots of fab camera and drone work zooming around all over the place. The first person gun work at one point added a new dimension.Miami looks beautiful with the Orange and Teal tones.Action galore and a good protagonist in Eric Dane, although his motive and why he is doing what he is, was pretty rubbish, but he still played it well, and to be fair you don't come in to this sort of film hoping for Shakespeare level story telling.Some fun cameos pop up which raise a smile.The soundtrack is good and Lorne Balfe delivers on the orchestrated score.It has all you would expect from a Michael Bay production. Definitely life still in the franchise."
The French Dispatch,2021,7.1,"A collection of stories published in ""The French Dispatch Magazine"" comes to life in a fictional twentieth century French city.","Whether you like it or not, there is establishment behind Wes Anderson and his style. Production designs, and soundtrack is always in its top and gets more and more artistic with each film yet, it is both positive and negative. For me, afterMoonrise Kingdom (2012)(my personal favourite by him) & especiallyThe Grand Budapest Hotel (2014), it is becoming harder to dive into the film or the characters. Don't get me wrong, it is visually stunning always and you could see the great choreography or design behind it but characters don't feel authentic like they used to.With the exception of ""The Concrete Masterpiece"". It was as engaging as it was beautiful. Benicio Del Toro & Lea Seydoux maintained to give something to hold on for audience (or at least me) even though it is hindered by the style.Also, I agree with Mr. Howitzer. The last discussion between Roebuck Wright and Nescaffier was indeed the best part literally.I am not in a level or a position to criticize or to give an advice but, I think it is best to returning back to the roots likeThe Royal Tenenbaums (2001),Rushmore (1998)or evenMoonrise Kingdom (2012)cause it is getting harder to watch it as a movie."
Poison,2023,6.8,"When a poisonous snake slithers onto an Englishman's stomach in India, his associate and a doctor race to save him.","""I'm sorry.""""You can't be.""What an ending. It's so devastating that it left me a bit speechless. No matter the good deeds you do for others, it will be ignored because your race and religion is a problem for some people.And that brings the end to the daily Wes Anderson's Netflix-Journey. I'm sad that it's over but I'm happy it exists.Dev Patel, Benedict Cumberbatch, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, Richard Ayoade, and Rupert Friend were all terrific.AI and dumb TikTok users could never do this. All these short films are the finest work from Mr. Anderson. I hope he makes more movies like this in the future."
Get Hard,2015,6.0,"When millionaire James King is jailed for fraud and bound for San Quentin, he turns to Darnell Lewis to prep him to go behind bars.","Good actors, but the humor didn't really click with me. It was a bit too vulgar and sexual for my taste and also the movie lacks a strong message to deliver to the audience."
The Iron Claw,2023,7.6,"The true story of the inseparable Von Erich brothers, who made history in the intensely competitive world of professional wrestling in the early 1980s.","The Von Erich's were always this odd story I heard when I was a kid. The wrestling family that kicked off what is now the professional wrestling dynasty. They were the superstars that also saddled with one of the darkest most bizarre curse. If you think about the tragedy of Chris Benoit, someone would always bring up the Von Erich's.The story is centered around Kevin Von Erich (Zac Efron), mostly because the tale can only be told through his window. A Texas family whose father Fritz (Holt McCallany) desperately wanted to be at the top of the game. He molded his sons to follow in his footsteps. Cold and focused, he is the father of that era that most today would consider abusive. Back then, to get greatness, sacrifice must be endured. In this case, the early wild death of the eldest brother Jack (who is never really addressed completely) since he was a baby when he passed from an electrocution accident. From that point on, the family presses forward.There is a dark cloud that hangs over the family, yet no one completely addresses it directly. The Von Erich curse seemed to be a real thing. And as a youngster, I always waited for the next Von Erich to die a weird death. Grim as it may seem.The brothers wake up and eat, drink and breathe wrestling. But there is a hierarchy. Broken down by the Fritz. The brothers are meant to compete with each other for the approval of Dad.There is also David (Harris Dickinson) and Kerry (Jeremy Allan White) but not mentioned...a brother Chris. I only knew Kerry, since he made it to the WWF.This at-the-fringe federation of wrestlers were in the NWA, which I always considered the low-rent of wrestling, as if there were such a thing.Kevin marries Pam (Lily James) who is really the most normal of the gang. The mother. Doris (Maura Tierney) seems to be just trying to placate Fritz but also focus on God.I truly miss this type of filmmaking. It is a story of family and tragedy and how they cope with it. Which sometimes I wish they showed more of that and less of the wrestling. This movie's emotional core stuck with me. Though, there are moments that drag, when you think about how awful events followed this family, you are left wondering how they were able to move forward.The answer isn't very clear. These are the moments I wish focused more on Kevin's resilience. Instead, we see he truly believes the family curse. And that would be enough. Perhaps the emotionally absent mother answers the question of pain and loss. There is a great moment when all the death occurs, Mom doesn't know how to cope. Because of her faith, you read the thought bubble which is asking God ""why am I being tested"" a brilliant move by director Sean Durkin NOT to have her say this outloud.One thing that may trouble some viewers is the Fritz's dialogue. At first, I considered it horrible acting. Then it occurred to me. He has been a showboat to audiences most his life. It isn't too far of a stretch that he knows no other way to communicate. He is a tough guy who relies on his sons to be equally as tough. Though he isn't that way at first, he downshifts into it with the success of the family.There's so much to unpack here.Mass kudos to Zac Efron. A brilliant piece of acting which should get him an Oscar nom (perhaps the Academy will never take him seriously...they should). In spite of his stoic mannerisms, Efron still exudes thought processes. In this case, tough guys aren't suppose to cry. But we cry for him.Wonderful work. This is a must to see in theaters. A small screen will not show the subtle performances."
"Introducing, Selma Blair",2021,7.8,A deeply intimate and raw portrait of Selma Blair after she is diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and tries to slow the progression of her disease.,"Selma's experience just brings it all home for us, doesn't it? We are fragile, impermanent beings who live every moment by chance. By chance, we made it home safely today. By chance, we grew old to see our children get married. By chance, we woke up one morning and couldn't feel our legs.If we're lucky, we all at one time in our lives will have that ""come to Jesus"" moment where life is very fxcking real and there we are standing at the shore trying to hold back the waves, only to realize we are not in control.This is one person's story of the human experience. It is funny. It's tragic. It's angry. It's hopeful. It's frustrating. It's spiritual.Forget who you are for just moment and watch this. Forget how you're going to get what you want, forget that resentment you're nursing, forget how wounded by others you feel - watch this, and connect with a story that is not Selma's alone but on a much deeper level is all of ours."
Renfield,2023,6.4,"Renfield, Dracula's tortured henchman, is forced to capture prey for his master and do his every bidding. But now, after centuries of servitude, Renfield is ready to see if there is a life outside his boss's shadow.","Renfield is a lot of fun, a fast paced 90 minute horror comedy that's diversions from its core idea are still funny and never on screen long enough to derail it. Underneath all the unapologetically over the top gore is a really heartwarming story about understanding and appreciating your own self worth.Nicholas Hoult cements his skills at comedy with another really funny performance and Renfield's lack of confidence and journey to find it is just really endearing. Awkwafina is obviously equally strong when it comes to comedy and this role also offers a few dramatic moments as well.Ben Schwartz adds another funny supporting performance to his resume, having definitely made up for Sonic 2 now. The best performance and strongest aspect of the whole film is easily Nicolas Cage as Dracula. He brings the Cage elements you expect whilst still having an intimidating presence. Even though he gets enough screen time, more Dracula would've been appreciated.Chris McKay's direction is really good, the film may lack an overall style but he makes sure the film is generally stylish with well implemented slow motion, energetic and well shot fight scenes and the odd montage. Also, this and 2020s The Invisible Man prove the Dark Universe being cancelled before it could get off the ground was the best thing as these films are way more unique and interesting."
A Quiet Place: Day One,2024,6.3,A young woman named Sam finds herself trapped in New York City during the early stages of an invasion by alien creatures with ultra-sensitive hearing.,"This movie wasn't bad but it could have been called Quiet Place 3. This movie should have focused more on the aliens, the why, where and how of them coming. Even how they were able to determine the mode of hunting and such frim the aliens. To me things like that would be a better prequel.I did really like the emotional aspect that was written into the story but it began to feel that story line became more the focus as the movie went on and the aliens became the after thought.The special effects were great. The alien design was same as before stellar. I think the movie would have benefited from being more focused on the aliens and building up to the fight against them."
Vaiana 2,2024,6.5,"After receiving an unexpected call from her wayfinding ancestors, Moana must journey to the far seas of Oceania and into dangerous, long-lost waters for an adventure unlike anything she's ever faced.","Reviewers say 'Moana 2' continues Moana's journey with stunning visuals and vibrant animation, exploring themes of leadership and cultural heritage. While praised for its humor and charming performances, the sequel is criticized for its predictable story and underdeveloped characters. Many feel it lacks the emotional depth and memorable music of the original, though it sets up potential for future installments."
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,2023,6.0,"During the '90s, a new faction of Transformers - the Maximals - join the Autobots as allies in the battle for Earth.","First, I have really enjoyed a number of the Transformers movies despite the usual criticisms. They were, generally, fun, well thought out intl terms of action scenes and had a few key actors to give them a little more appeal. This one seems to have the casting and script all wrong. The supposed academic is barely able to string a sentence together and is wholly unconvincing as someone who could work out how to get out of the bathroom let alone anything else (also the actress is dire but hardly the point). The main actor is uninspiring and deals with the awful script with seeming boredom (I doubt it is genuine boredom as this is presumably his big break) and the cutesy nod to the 90s for the transformers themselves seems, well, meh? Overall, boring, badly acted, shocking casting and a sad epitaph."
√Ä mon seul d√©sir,2022,6.1,"Have you ever been to a strip club? But you've already wanted to - at least once - you didn't dare, that's all. This film tells the story of someone who dared.","A hugely satisfying experience from start to finish, My Sole Desire weaves a lot of artistry throughout what could have easily just been a sweaty and stain-covered mess of tired tropes and exploitation. Kudos to Borleteau, and all of her collaborators, for producing something far removed from that. This is, in fact, quite brilliant, and it's just as equally about love and friendship as it is about sex and dancing... this from the only critic-review in English (read-it it's quite good).. a very adept concise summary of this wonderful little film... it'll well hold up to repeated viewings, its emotions genuine, acting superb, and production-values-remarkable.. these kinds of films are rarely as exceptional ... agree with the sentiment, thanks-bravo to all involved in its creation."
Mid-Century Modern,,7.5,"After an unexpected death, three best friends--gay gentlemen of a certain age--decide to spend their golden years living together in Palm Springs, where the wealthiest one lives with his mother.","With everything going on in the Country today it's refreshing to have a show like this. Mid-Centry Modern is like a 90's sitcom with a laugh track, great acting and fun little stories. Mat Bomer is adorable as always and Nathan Lane is a class act in this role. So sad to see that Linda Lavin is in it and not here with us anymore and is exactly what this show needed.i totally recommend Mid-Century Modern bright sets, witty humor, great writing and a realistic look at how gay culture is really like. If you want to just sit back and relax this is the show for you. The Golden Girls of the century."
Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind,2018,7.9,"An intimate look into the life and work of the revered master comedian and actor, Robin Williams.",You'll laugh and you'll cry. Such a Powerful documentary. Many people in the entertainment industry have come and gone but this is by far the Toughest. :(

Black Doves,,7.2,"After her lover is murdered by members of London's underworld, a spy - who is publicly the wife of the British Defence Secretary - is protected by an old friend from their agency.","Reviewers say 'Black Doves' is a British spy thriller with engaging plot, stylish action, and strong performances by Keira Knightley, Ben Whishaw, and Sarah Lancashire. Themes of espionage, political intrigue, and personal drama are highlighted. Critics commend the chemistry between leads and the blend of genres. However, some note script issues like clich√©d writing, tonal inconsistencies, and underdeveloped characters. The series is criticized for relying on genre tropes and implausible moments. Despite these flaws, many find it entertaining and worth watching."
Running Point,,7.3,"Isla Gordon, overlooked her whole life, is appointed President of the LA Waves basketball team, a family business, when her brother enters rehab. She aims to prove she is the right choice despite skepticism.","Reviewers say 'Running Point' is lauded for its humor, engaging characters, and the dynamic between Kate Hudson's character and the ensemble cast. The show's fresh take on sports narratives and exploration of family dynamics and leadership challenges are appreciated. However, some criticize it for lack of originality, excessive profanity, and predictable plotlines. Mixed opinions exist on character development and reliance on clich√©s. Despite these criticisms, many hope for a second season to further develop the story and characters."
Emily the Criminal,2022,6.7,"Down on her luck and saddled with debt, Emily gets involved in a credit card scam that pulls her into the criminal underworld of Los Angeles, ultimately leading to deadly consequences.","Emily the Criminal stands next to Maverick for the best thriller of the year. That's because of Aubrey Plaza, who plays the anti-hero for our timesThe eponymous bad girl of the Sundance breakout Emily the Criminal is as much a victim of society's neglect as she is of her own self-centeredness. Yet Emily (Aubrey Plaza) is self-sufficient and capable of kicking serious butt, not in a professional, martial-arts way, but in a way that mirrors her determination.It's not difficult to see why she is easily seduced from food-delivery work to credit card scamming given the $70K in school loans, half a degree, and her permanent record of aggravated assault and DUI. The clarity and tension with which writer/director John Patton Ford unfolds Emily's arc are admirable--anyone in the audience can immediately identify with her dilemma-to remain poor or to make enough to erase debt and live comfortably.Emily's only real friend is her old college chum, Liz (Megalyn Echikunwoke), who gets her an ad-agency interview with a mean womansplaining exec (Gina Gershon) that serves as the last testament to what Emily will suffer for every job she interviews: facing her criminal record and being offered, in this case, an internship for almost a half year without pay.Hooking up with an enterprise that scams credit cards is almost a given; hooking up with the middle manager, Yusuf (Theo Rossi),
is also a given, given that he is handsome, charming, and warm hearted. The drama actually comes alive when she begins scamming, showing a natural talent and aggressive enough, unlike other modern heroines, to escape by wit or just smarts with the help of a taser or boxcutters.Throughout Emily the Detective, Plaza plays a decent millenial who has been buffeted by fate and her own stern affect to find salvation in accelerating crime, for which she has talent. Emily is not really the criminal that Yusuf's colleagues are; rather she's a bright woman caught in a social satire both trenchant and scary.You'll love Plaza in this role. Just pray she can move from her deadpan characters to a variety of strong women. Like Ryan Gosling in Drive, she's impossible to ignore. She's that good."
K√°lm√°n-nap,2023,7.3,"It is a beautiful, sunny autumn morning in a nice, cozy house near a peaceful lake. K√°lm√°n no longer knows what love is. His asexual wife Olga proposes to remodel the house in a new attempt to save the relationship.",
Rachel Getting Married,2008,6.6,A young woman who has been in and out of rehab for the past ten years returns home for the weekend for her sister's wedding.,"Jonathan Demme back in great form. That's the good news. I've read somewhere he didn't want to work with actors anymore. He wanted to stick to documentaries where freedom (as a filmmaker) is king. I'm glad he changed his mind. He is a gift to actors and here they are subjected to a documentary style that for the first few minutes made me fear the worst but that at the end of the day it works brilliantly. Jenny Lumet's terrific scrip feels amazingly personal (wasn't her father, Sidney Lumet, once Lena Horne's son in law?)The characters are too vivid to be the figment of someone's imagination or is Demnme's documentary style that makes it appear that way?. I don't know and quite frankly I don't care. I went where the characters took me, Anne Hathaway and Rosemary DeWitt are terrific but it is Debra Winger's distant mother that will make me want to see this film again. I don't know how explain it. She's on the screen for a few minutes but her presence is extraordinary. Even when she's part of the crowd you can't take your eyes off her. Go see it/her"
Bend It Like Beckham,2002,6.7,"Jess Bhamra dreams of playing professional football, but her Sikh parents have plans for her: a law degree and a marriage. Jules, a white female striker, spots Jess playing football and invites her to join the local women's team.","Eight? Eight for a predictable sports-based movie where the lead overcomes every obstacle thrown at her and triumphs at the end just like every other sports-based movie? Have I gone mad? Well, no actually because although ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is as original as a boy-band cover version, it is still a surprisingly enjoyable film which somehow manages to avoid becoming another chick-flick clich√©. A solid cast add to the mix but while there are plenty of goals, there are still one or two holes at the back which threaten the side. Incidentally, whenever I talk about football, I refer to soccer in case any US readers get confused.Parminder ""ER"" Nagra plays Jess, a rebellious daughter in a strict Indian family living in London. Obsessed with football star David Beckham and possessing more skills on the pitch than she realises, she is spotted by another female footballer Jules (a very young-looking Keira Knightly) who persuades her to try out for a local football team, the Hounslow Harriers. Keeping her place in the side a secret from her family, she struggles with the gaping chasm in culture as well as her feeling for her coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys Meyers). As her sister's wedding day approaches and the resentment from his disapproving parents (Anupam Kher and Shaheen Khan) grows, can she develop her skills further and secure her dream of playing professionally in the US?Like I said, there is nothing shocking and surprising about the screenplay which manages to throw in every conceivable barrier for our hero to overcome. And despite the creaking plot, the story is enlivened by quality performances throughout. Nagra and Knightley are fantastic but Meyers lets the side down a bit. There is also a surprising amount of humour which is genuinely amusing, particularly from Knightley's mother (Juliet Stevenson) who worries excessively that her daughter is a closet lesbian. The clash of cultures does offer a unique perspective as far as sports movies go but it isn't much to offer the casual movie fan.But that's the thing with sports movies - no matter how impossible victory looks or how many obstacles you put in front of the hero, you still watch them to see the hero overcome it all and bask in the glory they richly deserve. You already know how the movie will end but that doesn't stop you enjoying it - a philosophy that surely led to Sylvester Stallone making ""Rocky Balboa"" recently. The fact that the hero in ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is a cute Indian girl instead of a sixty-year-old meat head means that this is not your typical sports movie. Instead of guts and sweat, it has heart and brains and it's that which gives this film its rating. See, I haven't gone mad..."
And Just Like That... The Documentary,2022,6.5,An immersive behind-the-scenes look at the filming of the first season of And Just Like That... (2021).,"Watching SJP totally out of touch with reality or people speaks volumes. I hated that I was so critical of the reboot, but after actually watching her and the other characters and their real life ""characters,"" I'm just grossed out. SJP is a joke...and so is this documentary. I didn't know if I was watching an episode of the kardashians or sex and the city. Sad. Hopefully they are smart and don't do another season. Just sad."
Dream Scenario,2023,6.8,An ordinary family man finds his life turned upside down when strangers suddenly start seeing him in their dreams.,"It was kind of hard to get into at first since the characters seem to come off kind of pompous and smug, which makes it hard to like them. Nic Cage's character comes off pretty pathetic and awkward - but that's the whole point. There were moments that were funny, but mostly I felt kind of uneasy. I think the camera was too close to the actors faces at times - that's probably what made me feel uncomfortable. It felt like I was invading their personal space. All that being said, this movie has probably one of the best fart scenes of all time. I would re-watch this movie just to experience that scene again lol.Dream Scenario is a pretty interesting look at what social media fame - or just fame in general - can do to a person and all the negative effects that come with it. It also highlights the toxicity of cancel culture. I guess moral of the story is: don't go chasing fame. Although, Paul didn't really engage in pursuing fame, it kind of came to him through something that was out of his control. The concept of ant intelligence and how ants might share a sort of hive mind definitely was a really interesting concept. I love how they tie that into the main story of how everyone is dreaming about the same person. The concept of influencers invading people's dreams to advertise products was an insane concept. Overall, this movie was pretty darn good. It had an interesting premise and took a creative approach when exploring its different concepts. I'd re-watch this movie and I can definitely recommend it if you want something different."
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One,2023,7.6,Ethan Hunt and his IMF team must track down a dangerous weapon before it falls into the wrong hands.,"Reviewers say 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One' offers thrilling action and impressive stunts, highlighting Tom Cruise's dedication. However, the convoluted plot, lack of character development, and inconsistent pacing are criticized. Hayley Atwell's Grace receives mixed reactions. The film's runtime and exposition reliance are contentious, with some finding it dragging and lacking emotional depth. Despite flaws, it is generally an enjoyable franchise entry."
On the Edge with Alex Honnold,,7.7,Professional adventure rock climber Alex Honnold embarks on a lifelong dream - an epic climbing quest across the remotest and toughest walls and peaks of Greenland.,"I am quite enjoying this new NG 3-part documentary on glaciers & Climate Change in Greenland, but wonder why it hs two titles: On the Edge and Arctic Ascent? Anyway, it's a bit of strange mixture of climbing from Alex Honnold and Hazel Findlay (who does not get enough credit on the net for her efforts in this expedition) and science.It was interesting to see them rappel down into a crevasse to test the water depth, plus trying to get two non-climbers over a 500m cliff must have been tough. The tension rises from the potential dangers of falling rock & ice, so I am looking forward to the third part on climbing the really huge wall at the end of the trip..."
The Outrun,2024,6.9,"After living life on the edge in London, Rona attempts to come to terms with her troubled past. Hoping to heal, she returns to the wild beauty of Scotland's Orkney Islands where she grew up.","It's not often that I leave a cinema feeling inspired by a film. The Outrun is one such movie. I have always been an advocate of the healing power of the natural world and watching this beautiful, but sometimes harrowing film, reinforced my philosophy. Sometimes the best stories are the simple ones and this is one of them. Saoirse Ronan produces and stars as the main character Rona who was bought up on the Orkney Isles, but hankers for the bright lights of London like so many other young people from isolated communities often do. The film does well to portray the pitfalls of living in a big city, but also deserves credit for showing the Orkney Isles as a clearly beautiful, but sometimes desolate place. In the same week I have also been to see two big budget films, but the Outrun was by far the best of the three albeit on a fraction of the budget. If you want to see a film that will make you feel more positive about life then I recommend you see this movie. I am glad that I did."
Alien: Romulus,2024,7.1,"While scavenging the deep ends of a derelict space station, a group of young space colonists come face to face with the most terrifying life form in the universe.","Reviewers say 'Alien: Romulus' is lauded for its visual and practical effects, and its respectful nod to the original films. The tense atmosphere, strong performances by Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson, and effective use of sound and cinematography are highlighted. However, criticisms include reliance on fan service, lack of originality, and overuse of callbacks. Issues with character development, pacing, and CGI usage are also noted. Despite these flaws, many find it an enjoyable and thrilling addition to the franchise."
The Amateur,2025,6.5,"When his supervisors at the CIA refuse to take action after his wife is killed in a London terrorist attack, a decoder takes matters into his own hands.",I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the cinema watching The Amateur. It should have been a short series maybe 4-6 Episodes as opposed to a feature film. I think 2 hours did not leave enough time for proper character development. For example the lead speaks about his great friend played by Lawerence Fisburn in a scene at the end of the film. We never really saw how the two developed that bond as there are barely 2-3 scenes with them together throughout the movie. It was fun though and I feel more so because I watched it at the Theatre. Will definitely give it a rewatch once I can on my couch and recommend anyone who just wants to kick back to give it a watch.
Explorer: The Last Tepui,2022,6.9,Follows elite climber Alex Honnold and a world-class climbing team on a grueling mission deep in the Amazon jungle.,"This was a quick, exciting, and entertaining documentary filled with beautiful scenery and lots of jungle trekking. I could probably watch Alex Honnold climb anything at this point but I would have loved to see more of the Tepui."
Tony Hawk: Until the Wheels Fall Off,2022,8.0,"Follows famous skater Tony Hawk's personal life, career and relationship with skateboarding, including never-before-seen footage and unprecedented access to Hawk, along with interviews with figures from the skateboarding world.","It was an awesome an humbling experience to watch Tony evolve during his early years at Del Mar. The Del Mar skate park allowed so many of us to take skateboarding to the next level. Meeting Tony there in the 80s inspired me for a lifetime, and meeting up with him again at the 2010 Olympics (watching Shawn W) inspired a renewed energy. I will always be thankful to have been present to watch him be unbelievable and extraordinary. - Doid."
Luca,2021,7.4,"On the Italian Riviera, an unlikely but strong friendship grows between a human being and a sea monster disguised as a human.","Have loved Pixar for years, well ever since seeing the first two 'Toy Story' films and 'A Bug's Life' when they first came out. Pre-2010 their films were consistently never less than very good and their best efforts outstanding. Pixar did start to vary post-2010, especially in the sequels, but the past seven years or so has seen some of their best work in 'Inside Out', 'Coco' and 'Soul'. Did like the concept for 'Luca', even if it was not a creative one.'Luca' turned out to be very, very charming and very high quality. It is not one of Pixar's best films by all means, other films of theirs are more creative conceptually and deeper and more complex emotionally and is not as good as their previous two films 'Soul' and 'Onward'. At the same time, there is more than enough to 'Luca' to stop it from being lesser Pixar, a list that includes most of the sequels post-2010 and 'The Good Dinosaur'.There is not an awful lot that is wrong with 'Luca'. It is very slight and takes its time to get going.Also thought that the portrayal of the bullies was overdone and on the stereotypical side.On the other hand, the animation is stunning. Especially the vibrant colours and beautiful Italian landscapes, while the characters expressions and movements are nuanced and natural. The music is a nice mix of stirringly upbeat and poignant-sounding in the quieter moments. As well as having an affectionately Italianate sound. The script is smart and knows its target audience without trying too hard to appeal to them or anybody outside it. The humour is genuinely amusing, while there is plenty of heart without being too sentimental.While the story is slight and not perfectly paced, it makes great nostalgic use of the Italian setting and doesn't resort too much to cultural stereotyping. Appreciated its handling of the messaging too, the messages are great and relatable ones that have a lot of resonance and relevance that could easily have been preachy but not once does the messages of loyalty, friendship and respect feel forced or condescending. There are plenty of sight gags that come thick and fast and they are genuinely funny, but there is a warm heart and poignancy too. Particularly in the friendship between the three leads. The characters are worth engaging with, only the bullies don't quite come off, while the climax has plenty of excitement. The voice acting is dynamic and emotive with the accents not coming over as too stereotyped.In conclusion, very good. 8/10."
Edge of the Unknown with Jimmy Chin,,7.6,"Take a look inside the minds of elite adventure athletes through transformative stories about facing fear, personal loss, and Mother Nature.","It's strange that noone has reviewed it yet. This is a very good documentary, pretty interesting for those who enjoy watching these activities. Alex honnold and his FREE SOLO oscar has made a lot of people engage. There is an episode here with him, probably the best of this series. However, rest of the series is entertaining too. I enjoyed every episode. Running time is 25 minutes, so there are no boring moments here. There is a sad episode too. It was necassary though in order for the viewers to realise this world in its entirety.To sum up, if you liked FREE SOLO, THE ALPINIST, MERU, THE DAWM WALL, and other similar documentaries, you 'll like this too."
The Present,2024,5.5,"A brilliant boy discovers that he can manipulate time using a family heirloom. He soon teams up with his siblings in returning to the time of their parents' separation, with hopes of changing the outcome.","This is a comedic family drama fantasy about a couple with 3 kids who are on the verge of their separation. With the help of the old magical grandfather clock, their kids trying to stop their parents from separating. The movie showed the story from many points of view. Every time they rewind the day, it started from somebody else's point of view. And it gave the audience a chance to understand and relate to all of the family members. This is a funny, touching and beautiful family movie. I recommend this one to watch with your family. The acting is decent, the story is good, and it has a decent ending."
Fast X,2023,5.7,Dom Toretto and his family are targeted by the vengeful son of drug kingpin Hernan Reyes.,"The movie starts it story from the first ten minutes of Fast Five. The story starts out of nowhere and thr scenes are not even connected properly with each other. Any scene comes out of nowhere. The performances by all the cast members felt weak and the character development of the main Villian was bad. Jason's character wanted revenge in the movie but it more looked like he was a psycho who kills people for fun. The main problem with this franchise is saturated. It feels like we have seen all this millions of times and the action scenes doesn't amaze you.Overall, it was an average action movie and the franchise has reached fatigue."
Kaos,,7.4,"As discord reigns on Mount Olympus and almighty Zeus spirals into paranoia, three mortals are destined to reshape the future of humankind.","I'm not the kind of person who writes reviews on tv shows... but is the first time im hooked on one tv show in a long time and you just cancell it...1: I didn't feel the inclusion on this series forced , it was smooth and love it.2: Acting was amazing! Seeing zeus going down in the spiral of paranoia... delightful..I can't comprehend how i didn't saw any promotion about this serie , i saw it because a review in tiktok!! How can you give me Emily in paris 3000 , and ridicule shows and cancel this... how you prefer just throw money on 10 awful shows but not that money on one amazing show.. because this serie is ART.But that's it, this cancelation is my foot in the ground, im going to cancel netflix over this, i prefer to pay other platforms before a company who just thinks about ""audience size"" my son can watch disney + anyways.."
The Electric State,2025,5.9,"An orphaned teen hits the road with a mysterious robot to find her long-lost brother, teaming up with a smuggler and his wisecracking sidekick.","The Electric State is actually a very good concept, but its execution is incredibly rushed, with no real character or world development.The cast is incredible and the visuals are fantastic, but this really needed to be a limited series. Two hours is nowhere near enough time for an unorthodox story like this.The limited robots we meet seem silly and ineffective, so a more developed backstory could have really served to make this world much more realistic and menacing. But it seems they took numerous shortcuts in the story to move it along and finish it a movie timelength. A perfect example of what they could have done is Sweettooth, another very unique Netflix property that has much higher ratings."
A Minecraft Movie,2025,5.6,Four misfits are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into a bizarre cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home they'll have to master this world while embarking on a quest with an unexpected expert crafter.,"As a longtime Minecraft player, I've waited years for this movie-and while it didn't blow me away, it didn't disappoint either.The film delivers solid humor and entertainment, backed by impressive CGI. Jack Black and Jason Momoa absolutely shine, but the story falls short with flat character development and a predictable, overly shallow plot that could have been so much more.If you are looking for peak cinema with in-depth meanings and inspirations, I do not recommend watching this movie.But if you are just looking for a simple, fun, and enjoyable movie, this might be the one for you.7/10."
The Accountant 2,2025,6.6,Christian Wolff applies his brilliant mind and illegal methods to reconstruct the unsolved puzzle of a Treasury chief's murder.,"Ben Affleck's portrayal of Christian Wolff in The Accountant 2 feels noticeably different this time around. His character's autism traits seem more exaggerated, which comes off as a disservice to the subtle brilliance of the original performance. The addition of more overt comic relief also feels jarring and out of place-it shifts the tone from the gritty, tightly wound thriller of the first film into something less focused. That said, there are a handful of scenes that are exceptionally well shot, with crisp choreography and dark, gritty visuals. Ultimately, the film struggles to balance its identity, wavering between serious character study and action-comedy hybrid. It's watchable, but not nearly as satisfying as the first."
Anatomy of a Fall,2023,7.6,A woman is suspected of murder after her husband's death; their half-blind son faces a moral dilemma as the main witness.,"Reviewers say 'Anatomy of a Fall' is a compelling courtroom drama exploring themes of truth and human relationships. Sandra H√ºller's performance and the intelligent screenplay receive praise, while the pacing and complexity draw some criticism. The emotional courtroom scenes are noted for their tension, though a few find the film could be more concise. Overall, it is seen as a resonant film that challenges viewers."
Champions,2023,6.8,"A former minor-league basketball coach is ordered by the court to manage a team of players with intellectual disabilities. He soon realizes that despite his doubts, together, this team can go further than they ever imagined.","A very warm, smaller movie about a group of rag-tag basketball players with various intellectual and physical challenges. By strange luck they get a recent former professional basketball coach who helps them not only learn how to play better but also to have pride in their ""championship"" accomplishes, even if they never actually win a championship. My favorite was Madison Tevlin as Cosentino, a fiery character that can motivate the guys when needed.Woody Harrelson is the professional coach, he is very good but gets fired as the movie starts. Seems he is a bit too insistent towards the head coach. Then he unwisely starts to drive home with a few too many beers in him, crashes into a parked police car, and has to go before the lady judge who detests drunk drivers. He will either get 18 months in jail, or do 90 days of community service. Coaching the local basketball team made up of special needs individuals. Easy choice, given the two alternatives.The first 30 minutes or so are hard to get through, there is a lot of foolishness as the situation and characters are established. In fact my wife abandoned it about 30 minutes in, she said it was too slow. But it picked up right after that and the whole movie turned out to be quite entertaining with good messages.At home , streaming on Peacock."
Air,2023,7.4,The history of the game-changing partnership between a then undiscovered Michael Jordan and Nike's fledgling basketball division which revolutionized the world of sports and culture with the Air Jordan brand.,"Reviewers say 'Air' is a compelling film about Nike's rise and the Air Jordan brand, focusing on a crucial marketing deal. Themes include branding power, corporate impact on culture, and business innovation. Strong performances by Matt Damon, Viola Davis, and Ben Affleck are highlighted, along with the nostalgic 1980s setting. However, some find the story predictable and pacing uneven. The decision to not show Michael Jordan's face is both praised and criticized. Overall, 'Air' is entertaining and informative."
Wild Roots,2021,7.3,"A wild 12 year old girl who has been with her grandparents decides against their advice to seek out her father, a bouncer with a temper who is just getting out of prison.",I saw this movie at Bogazici Film Festival in Istanbul. This movie portrays the relationship between a rough man who is trying his best to act like a dad and his daughter. The film records the feelings in the most successful way. Also its so well shot. Cinematography is great. And there were some instense moments that almost made me cry.
The Penguin,,8.6,"Following the events of The Batman (2022), Oz Cobb, a.k.a. the Penguin, makes a play to seize the reins of the crime world in Gotham.","Reviewers say 'The Penguin' is acclaimed for Colin Farrell's compelling performance and its deep dive into Gotham's criminal world. The series is celebrated for its dark cinematography and robust character arcs. However, some critics argue the plot is slow and derivative, lacking unique elements. Mixed opinions exist on character and storyline execution, with some finding certain aspects unrealistic. Despite this, many appreciate the show's immersive, gritty atmosphere and the enriched portrayal of the Penguin."
A Simple Favor,2018,6.7,"Stephanie is a single mother with a parenting vlog who befriends Emily, a secretive upper-class woman who has a child at the same elementary school. When Emily goes missing, Stephanie takes it upon herself to investigate.",It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen and all the actors play roles they are typically type cast for. It was surprisingly funny though and honestly kind of enjoyable although super far fetched. At least it wasn't the same old recycled trash we've all been seeing lately.
Havoc,2025,5.7,"After a drug deal gone wrong, a bruised detective must fight his way through the criminal underworld to rescue a politician's estranged son, unraveling a deep web of corruption and conspiracy that ensnares his entire city.","Havoc truly shines through its incredible action sequences-long, fast-paced scenes packed with blood and gunfire! Every action fan will definitely get their money's worth here.However, the film fails on almost every other level. It has no real meaning or depth, which makes it hard to get invested. As a result, it also lacks real tension.On top of that, the movie is filled with irrelevant characters and side plots, making it hard to follow at times.Tom Hardy delivers a solid performance as always, but he's given almost nothing to work with here.Unfortunately, this one is only recommended for hardcore action enthusiasts."
Venom: The Last Dance,2024,6.0,Eddie Brock and Venom must make a devastating decision as they're pursued by a mysterious military man and alien monsters from Venom's home world.,"Reviewers say 'Venom: The Last Dance' offers Tom Hardy's compelling dual performance with humor and intensity. Praised for its action sequences and visual effects, the film struggles with a disjointed plot and underdeveloped characters. The Eddie-Venom dynamic is strong, yet the movie is criticized for lacking originality and emotional depth. Its darker tone and humor receive mixed reactions, making it an entertaining yet flawed trilogy conclusion."
Branson,,7.1,Sixteen days before Richard Branson is scheduled to make a potentially historic flight as first passenger to reach space in his own spacecraft in July 2021,"As Episode 1 of ""Branson"" (2022 release; 4 episodes of about 60 min. Each) opens, it is ""June 25, 2021, 14 days before Branson flies into space"" and Branson addresses the camera, in case something goes wrong. We then go back in time to ""1970"" when he starts a student magazine and two years later he launches Virgin Records as a cut price alternative label. At this point we are less than 10 minutes into Episode 1.Couple of comments: this is the latest from writer-director Chris Smith (""100 Foot Wave""). Here he is granted full access to Richard Branson, as Branson talks about his life and career. Simply going on Episode 1 (the only episode released as of now), this is all quite straight-forward, and not a single critical question or comment can be heard. In the early days money was tight, and then one day Richard is a billionaire, just like that. Richard's wife of 40+ years, Joan, is interviewed extensively, as is Richard's sister. Perhaps the best story is how Richard buys Necker Island in the BVI for next to nothing (asking price: $4 million; Richard gets it for $180,000).""Branson"" has been heavily promoted on HBO in recent weeks, and Episode 1 premiered just.a couple of days ago. This isn't a ""bade"" mini-series, but it certainly isn't greatly compelling either. And lack any new insights on Branson. Of course don't take my word for it, so I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion."
Paddington in Peru,2024,6.6,"Paddington returns to Peru to visit his beloved Aunt Lucy, who now resides at the Home for Retired Bears. With the Brown family in tow, a thrilling adventure ensues when a mystery plunges them into an unexpected journey.","Reviewers say 'Paddington in Peru' is a heartwarming adventure, though it varies in quality compared to its predecessors. Themes of family and identity are explored with charm and humor, though some find it less original. Ben Whishaw‚Äôs performance is praised, but cast changes receive mixed reactions. The animation and Peruvian setting are highlights, though the film is criticized for being predictable. It‚Äôs a fun, family-friendly film, though it may not fully match earlier standards."
Zero Day,,7.0,"In the midst of crisis, how can we discover the truth when it seems the world is being destroyed by uncontrollable forces? And to what extent are conspiracy theories our own inventions or products of our imagination?","Reviewers say 'Zero Day' is a political thriller featuring a strong performance by Robert De Niro, delving into cyber warfare and political intrigue. Praises include De Niro's acting, engaging plot, and high production values. Criticisms involve pacing issues, shallow character development, and predictability. Some find it overly political or culturally irrelevant, while others criticize the script and dialogue for being forced and unrealistic. Despite these issues, many find the series entertaining and valuable for its themes and performances."
Jack Whitehall: Settle Down,,6.5,"Jack Whitehall takes the stage at London's O2 Arena to riff on dogs, drinking, dining alone, and finally deciding to settle down and become a father.","It's weird to me how someone genuinely funny like Jack Whitehall could produce such a boring hour of standup comedy. He's much funnier in British game shows without a script than he is in his own special.""Settle Down"" was the one standup I was waiting for tonstart February well, but it failed to deliver. Jack Whitehall seems to be embracing some kind of a persona instead of being himself and it's not working well. I haven't laughed even one time out loud, all I got was a smirk, and it was actually based on an old Jimmy Carr joke. I'd call that joke straling but hey, they seem to be friends with Jimmy, maybe he got the permission.Jack is kind of going for a ""silly soy boy"" persona and it doesn't suit him at all. His energy doesn't match his jokes and that's the reason he gets more applause breaks than laughs from the audience.Look, I knew from the trailer than if this is the hook part (the one with the little dog), then something should be very wrong with this special. And there IS something very wrong with it. It's in this new style of ""feel good comedy"" that's not really comedy and it doesn't really make me feel good. The act is clean (I think?) but that doesn't help anyone. If anything, it makes Jack look more like an entertainer at a kids party than a standup comedian.The material was predictable and I can only guess that even a novice comedy fan would know the punchline 4 seconds before the end lf every joke. And again - there weren't many jokes, because they were in the form of long, realistic stories, that Jack Whitehall somehow made not believable with his tone. Seriously, when a good comedian is telling a story, you can believe it even of it's obviously a lie. The good comedian paints a picture with his masterful use of words. Jack Whitehall did the opposite - he told stories that could very well be true, but he told them so badly, you could barely believe him."
Concussion,2015,7.1,"In Pittsburgh, accomplished pathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu uncovers the truth about brain damage in football players who suffer repeated concussions in the course of normal play.","The acting was Oscar worthy, the science behind the discovery was fascinating, and the fact that it's based on a true story is incredible. It's proof that one person can make a difference. What is more impressive is after watching the film I discovered that this movie was a watered-down version of the original script. Even though Sony tried to avoid legal issues with the NFL by softening the script, I still found it spellbinding.I will say that I think it's ironic Sony made a movie about a man taking a stand against the NFL yet Sony pictures, with all their resources, are too afraid to do the same."
The Four Seasons,,7.2,"Three suburban couples vacation together each season, but tensions arise when one couple splits up and the husband brings a much younger woman on subsequent trips.","I loved this limited series. Good cast, good script, I laughed out loud several times in every episode. The person whose review called it bourgeois sounded very bitter and was way off base in my opinion. I did not find the characters ""out of touch"" and there were no ""lavish"" vacations. One of them owned a vacation home that the all went to twice. One of the other trips was to their and their children's college for "" family weekend"" and the third was to a presumably inexpensive ie not very fancy Caribbean resort. I have seen the 1981 movie 2-3 times and was pleased with the way this version was similar but did not try to replicate the original. And I loved the ending which I was not expecting. Such an enjoyable experience!"
Captain America: Brave New World,2025,5.6,"Sam Wilson, the new Captain America, finds himself in the middle of an international incident and must discover the motive behind a nefarious global plan.","Reviewers say 'Captain America: Brave New World' presents a mixed experience. Anthony Mackie and Harrison Ford's performances are lauded, yet pacing issues and underdeveloped villains are criticized. CGI reliance and repetitive action sequences receive mixed feedback. The blend of political thriller and superhero elements is seen as both engaging and flawed. The film is appreciated for connecting with previous MCU installments, offering a competent yet average experience with room for future improvement."
No Good Deed,,7.0,A story of three very different families trying to buy the very same 1920s Spanish style villa that they think will solve all their problems.,"Netflix has it listed as a comedy
It stars Ray Romano and Lisa Kudrow and Will Ferrell is a producer. This would normally be enough for me to run a mile, except that 1) i love Friends and 2) i was a bit desperate to find something to watchI expected to give it about 20 minutes but watched it all in 2 days and really enjoyed it. There were enough twists and turns to keep me interested and I was wondering if they might make another season with a new storyline and characters because I would like to see what else the writers could come up with.It's definitely worth a watch. It's one of those stories where you are pretty sure you know what's going on, and then you don't, then you think you do buuuttt then you don't again.The only complain I have is that I'm back where I was 2 days ago needing to find something else to watch."
Agatha All Along,,7.2,"A spell-bound Agatha Harkness regains freedom thanks to a teen's help. Intrigued by his plea, she embarks on the Witches' Road trials to reclaim her powers and discover the teen's motivations.","Reviewers say 'Agatha All Along' offers strong performances, especially Kathryn Hahn, and a compelling premise about Agatha Harkness' power quest. Praised for dark humor, plot twists, and themes of redemption and witchcraft, it faces criticism for inconsistent pacing, weak dialogue, and underdeveloped characters. Some find its focus on gender politics detracts from the narrative. Despite issues, the series is appreciated for its blend of mystery, magic, and humor, though opinions on its MCU success vary."
Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning,2025,7.3,"Hunt and the IMF pursue a dangerous AI called the Entity that's infiltrated global intelligence. With governments and a figure from his past in pursuit, Hunt races to stop it from forever changing the world.","Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is a bit of a disappointment, coming off the particularly high highs of Fallout and Dead Reckoning. The stakes are heightened narratively, with the end of the world being imminent throughout, but you don't often feel the desperation; you're mostly just told about it. And that's one of the things that holds this film back. It's so weighed down in exposition and dialogue scenes that aren't necessarily that much worse than such scenes in the other films in the series, but they're inferior enough that they start to drag. And there's not enough action here, which feels weird to say. There needed to be one more set piece, preferably during the first hour, because this is a long movie and the first hour or more is honestly a bit dull. The funny banter was also much less funny, when they even attempted humor. It's kind of a dour movie, which makes sense with the stakes, but also, I didn't really feel those stakes. So I would've rather just had that usual breezy team chemistry and joke-making.Speaking of stakes and showing things, I would've loved a set piece in a populated area? Or an action scene that felt more alive/crowded/in a place that felt real. In The Final Reckoning, there's an extended one with Cruise alone, one near the end (and on some of the posters for the film) involving some small planes, and then a handful of small shootouts and fist fights. There's nothing that's as big or as exciting as the whole train sequence in Dead Reckoning, and that film had some city action (plus a great car chase) and the whole airport scene. It's fresher in my mind than The Final Reckoning, even though I saw one two years ago and the other two hours ago. There's more tension and a feeling of danger when you can see civilization and bystanders, I think. And with everyone in the world being in danger because of the plot, it was weird to feel like no one (other than the main heroes and villains) was in danger during the action scenes.The finale of this movie is smaller scale, but that sequence is a knockout. It's almost worth the price of admission, but you do have to slog through some dreary stuff beforehand. The end of the world is nigh, but mostly you just hear about it, or some high-ranking government officials discuss things in board/bored rooms (and some of those scenes feel like if they were pushed into territory that was any more over-dramatic, we'd have Dr. Strangelove-esque comedy).The more I think about it, the more I realize this was kind of disappointing, even if I really loved the one big action scene that will, eventually, be the only thing I remember about this. I'm torn between like a 3/5 or a 3.5/5, and think I have to go more toward the former, just because this is too long for something with so little action. It needed to show more of the world, and we needed at least one sequence with more people and things in it. I feel like Dead Reckoning had about two or three times more great action than this, and the same can be said about Fallout. Dead Reckoning was a few minutes shorter, and Fallout was like half an hour shorter. Neither cost as much, but both felt more expensive. More bang for your buck watching those, and fewer bucks spent by the filmmakers to make them. The Final Reckoning feels pretty expensive, but not $300-400 million expensive.They got a little lazy with The Final Reckoning. They didn't get lazy in the couple of particularly flashy scenes, but they needed more big scenes and they shouldn't have had the film feel so empty. Too much telling, not enough showing. The lack of a consistent villain throughout hurt - Gabriel was a compelling presence in Dead Reckoning, but he's not in this one as much, disappearing for long stretches at a time.The Final Reckoning comes alive in parts. The plane stuff is thrilling. 90% of the movie, or maybe even a little more, fluctuates between being a tiny bit disappointing and very disappointing. I guess overall, I'm quite disappointed they couldn't keep the momentum going; these films had just kept getting better, from the second onwards, but no more.This really will be the Final one, I Reckon. Can't see it turning a profit, either."
Abbott Elementary,,8.2,"A workplace comedy centered on a group of dedicated teachers - and an oblivious principal - in a Philadelphia public school where, despite the odds stacked against them, they are determined to help their students succeed in life.","Reviewers say 'Abbott Elementary' is a humorous and relatable show that effectively captures the challenges of teaching in underfunded schools. Praised for its realistic portrayal, well-developed characters, and sharp writing, the mockumentary style is often noted. However, some find it too close to real experiences, hindering escapism. Despite mixed opinions, most appreciate its humor, heartwarming moments, and positive depiction of teachers."
Concussion,2013,5.6,"After a blow to the head, Abby decides she can't do it anymore. Her life just can't be only about the house, the kids and the wife. She needs more: she needs to be Eleanor.","Or life altering. I don't think you have to be lesbian to make a film about lesbians, but in this case it clearly did not hurt. But to reduce it only to that (positively/negatively) would not be fair to the movie and the story it tries to tell. The script is clever without trying. Of course some might only be intrigued or appalled as already mentioned by the lesbian theme. Hope you can see through that and concentrate on the movie and its themes.It's about love in general, about loss and life and many other things. Dialog is really good, the cast is amazing. It was one of the positive surprises at the Berlin International Festival. I can only recommend it"
Lilo & Stitch,2025,6.8,"A lonely Hawaiian girl befriends a runaway alien, helping to mend her fragmented family.","If you are expecting a carbon copy of the animated version, you will be disappointed. The story has been changed, characters removed, not many laughs and too much focus on the human characters.Stitch had some cute moments but they were few and far between.The key introduction to a new neighbour was an added touch but I do feel that this was needed as the film did drag on. At 1 hour 45 mins, this could easily have been reduced to a 90 min movie.This could have been so much better and this had high potential but sadly fails.Was an okay watch for a rainy day but wouldn't rush to watch again."
The Machine,2023,5.7,Bert's drunken past catches up with him 20 years down the road when he and his father are kidnapped by those Bert wronged 20 years ago while drunk on a college semester abroad in Russia.,"I really wanted to like this movie and I didn't hate it per se, but it was not what the trailer made it out to be. I am a huge fan of comedy/action movies like The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent but this one didn't quite fit the bill. The set up took way too long. I spent the first probably hour and fifteen minutes thinking meh I could leave and wouldn't care if I didn't see the end. It hit its stride in the middle and then tied everything together but not in the most satisfying way. The main character arc seemed a little abrupt and not so much earned. Mark Hamil was not used correctly. He did the best with what he was given and it seemed like a film he would have enjoyed making but his comedy was a little forced. The best part of this film was definitely the end, when the comedy reached its peak. The action was very fun to watch on the big screen but other than that if you've seen the trailer you've seen the best comedy it has to offer."
A Real Pain,2024,7.1,"Mismatched cousins reunite for a tour through Poland to honor their beloved grandmother, but their old tensions resurface against the backdrop of their family history.","Reviewers say 'A Real Pain' delves into family, trauma, and self-discovery through the complex relationship of two cousins. Kieran Culkin's portrayal of Benji, dealing with mental health and existential crises, is lauded for its rawness. Jesse Eisenberg's direction and writing are praised for authenticity, though some find the narrative predictable. Performances, especially Culkin's, are noted for their nuance. The film's exploration of the Holocaust and use of Chopin's music enhance its atmosphere, making it a poignant and thought-provoking experience."
Mountainhead,2025,5.4,Four friends reunite during worldwide economic turmoil.,"I am not sure what they were going for. It was marketed as somewhat of a thriller, but the dialogue was trying to be comedic and quite frankly the execution was poor. The whole plot wasn't very feasible and it's another one of those straight to TV movies. The premise that one of them released software that could create deep, fake AI stories that couldn't be detected seem to be ignored by everybody in the world, and it was causing disruption everywhere when everybody in the world knew the stories were only on that particular platform, which had already announced that you should be skeptical. Aside from that a whole plot involving the four billionaires was not very believable."
I agries meres mas,2025,5.7,Chloe runs away to Greece with a band of romantic outsiders.,"The movie had a lot of cringe moments, which really converted it from a drama to a comedy.A lot of things which would be considered necessary to understanding some of the scenes were not explained and other scenes just broke the immersion instantly with oversimplification (for example how did Chloe leand to deactivate alarms in only one night). Furthermore, I couldn't bring myself to stop laughing with the language used since in some scenes 5 out of 10 words were swear words. Overall the movie could be characterized as q comedy for the cringe moments but certainly not drama or a social awareness movie."
Wonka,2023,6.9,"With dreams of opening a shop in a city renowned for its chocolate, a young and poor Willy Wonka discovers that the industry is run by a cartel of greedy chocolatiers.","Reviewers say 'Wonka' is a whimsical prequel with Timoth√©e Chalamet's performance receiving mixed reactions compared to Gene Wilder. Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa cameo is praised for humor. Musical numbers are divisive, with some finding them nostalgic and others forgettable. Vibrant visuals and production design are lauded. Themes of resilience and creativity are central, though darker elements from Dahl's work are missing. The film's age suitability is debated, and comparisons to previous Wonka films yield mixed opinions."
Cocaine Bear,2023,5.9,"An oddball group of cops, criminals, tourists and teens converge on a Georgia forest where a huge black bear goes on a murderous rampage after unintentionally ingesting cocaine.","A bear gets hooked on cocaine, everyone wants the stash, Police, criminals, teenage gangsters, but none want it more badly than the bear.I almost gave up fifteen minutes in, as I thought it was a straight up apex predator movie, it kind of is, but it's a cocaine bear comedy. Once you realise what you're in for, I urge you to stick with it, as it is genuinely hilarious, it's so funny.It's amazing to believe that the story is actually inspired by actual, real life events, people's personalities change on drugs, why shouldn't a bear's?I think the bear looks pretty good to be honest, the ambulance scene looked great, talk about crazy.Don't expect brilliance, it's too zany for that, but it is a lot of fun.7/10."
Clue,1985,7.3,"Six guests are anonymously invited to a strange mansion for dinner, but after their host is killed, they must cooperate with the staff to identify the murderer as the bodies pile up.","When I started watching ""Clue"" I was amused by the fact that it was based on the famous game of the same name. Two or three actors that I liked are also listed in the cast, so I thought I might give this a shot, if only for curiosity value. Well, what do you know, ""Clue"" is one of the most fast paced and wittiest play-like comedies ever committed to film! Somehow the makers really managed to make this an original crime/comedy that spoofs all the Agatha Christie whodunnit-movies and blending it effortlessly with references to the the game. The script is so witty and clever it seems like a modern Oscar Wilde-adaptation. The actors and actresses help making it come to life. Even though I was mainly watching this for Christopher Lloyd (who starred in ""Back To The Future"" that same year, which is kinda hard to believe if you compare his looks in the two movies), Tim Curry (whose performance here seriously rivals all his other great roles like Frank 'N' Furter and Pennywise The Clown) and Michael McKean (great as ever), the whole cast really blew me away, because it had such a great on screen-chemistry together.Up until the ending (the three different endings, that is), ""Clue"" is one hell of an entertaining ride that doesn't bore you for a second. This one is a real sleeper, one of the greatest and most overlooked comedies of the 80's. If you get a chance to watch it, definitely do so!"
Predator: Killer of Killers,2025,7.5,Three of the fiercest warriors in human history become prey to the ultimate killer of killers.,"Idk, it's fun to watch but ultimately it makes predators look weak!! Suggests the predators don't know wtf they're doing. It should be RARE for a predator to lose. Same reason John wick 3 bothered me, this super strong character gets kinda beat up then kicks the others ass but let's them live so they can keep fighting only to lose? Predator doesn't respect weakness so they should've ALL lost...Disappointing, wanted deadliest warrior but with predator just to see who did best against them, but we got some bigger story that was kinda lame.*takes deep breathe*
guess I can fly this spaceship now >:("
The Old Guard 2,2025,5.1,"Andy leads immortal warriors against a powerful enemy threatening their group. They grapple with the resurfacing of a long-lost immortal, complicating their mission to safeguard humanity.","My god why?I am a lover of entertainment. I respect the films by what they are. That is why i love(d) fast and the furious franchise, mission: impossible, heck, i loved the other guys and movies like that. And i loved the first movie, the old guard.But what is this? Half a movie? And so poorly paced, made, no momentum, no passion or ideas.... how does netflix do it? How can it aim and achoe the worst possible outcome?? That is why alghoritms are no match for criativity and art. Aiming at everyone, the please no one. It sucks.I wish they let writera write and produce good content. Look at Apple. They are killing it!"
Brick,2025,5.5,A couple whose apartment building is suddenly surrounded by a mysterious brick wall must work with their neighbors to find a way out.,"I'm a bit surprised at the number of one-star reviews for this film. ""Bad acting,"" ""Dumb script,"" etc. I actually thought this was the time of storyline that Rod Serling would have written for a Twilight Zone episode and certainly intriguing enough to hold my attention throughout. The story centers on the husband and wife whose relationship is now in ruins. The other characters suffer from lack of development. I'm wondering if some viewers watched this film in the dubbed version -- where the English speaking dubbers are indeed bad and the translations awkward. I watched the subtitled version and I so no problems at all with the acting. Certainly the basic plot arc is not original -- it is similar to films like Saw, Escape Room, Cube and even Poseidon Adventure: characters must work together in order to escape and survive. But I found the film atmospheric and engaging. Granted the whole creation of the impenetrable wall and what has caused it is far fetched, but so what. There is also in interesting visual correlative throw in -- the fly. I wish there had been more visual moments like this, but just sit back and enjoy a ""Twilight Zone"" style story."
F1,2025,7.8,A Formula One driver comes out of retirement to mentor and team up with a younger driver.,"The cinematographers should have received 30 million in salary for their incredible work. Unfortunately, the storyline is older than a Model T, but nothing classic about it. Pitt does a nice job playing his role, but the script is so mundane all I can say is he did a nice job with what he had to work with. Same for Javiar. Everyone else is forgetable. Pitt must be a screwd businessman to have scored 30 million to make this movie. Fun to watch, but lots of dead spots inbetween race scenes. If you like Formula 1 racing, see it. If you don't, nothing here to see. After you've seen this, you will leave the theatre thinking ""I think I've seen this before"". That's because you have, many many times."
Saturday Night,2024,6.9,"At 11:30pm on October 11th, 1975, a ferocious troupe of young comedians and writers changed television forever. Find out what happened behind the scenes in the 90 minutes leading up to the first broadcast of Saturday Night Live (1975).","Reviewers say 'Saturday Night' captures the chaotic energy of 'Saturday Night Live's' first episode. The ensemble cast is praised, and the real-time format and 70s aesthetic are effective, though some find it overly chaotic and humorless. Historical accuracy and character portrayals receive mixed feedback. Despite this, the film is valued for its nostalgia and strong performances."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,2023,7.2,"A charming thief and a band of unlikely adventurers embark on an epic quest to retrieve a lost relic, but things go dangerously awry when they run afoul of the wrong people.","Reviewers say 'Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves' is an entertaining fantasy adventure with humor, action, and magic. Chris Pine and Michelle Rodriguez are praised for their performances. The film's tone is likened to 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. Humor and light-heartedness are appreciated, though some find it lacking depth. Visual effects and production design receive mixed reviews. The story is seen as predictable by some, while others enjoy its simplicity. It‚Äôs a decent, enjoyable watch for fantasy fans, though not groundbreaking."
My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3,2023,5.2,"After the death of the family's patriarch, Toula attempts to locate her father's childhood friends in Greece for a family reunion.","I loved the first Greek Wedding movie. It was charming and poignant and had universal. ""annoying family"" appeal. The second movie was not nearly as good, though it was interesting to see what happened and it was nice to revisit the charming characters. That latter attribute is the only good part on the third installment.Seeing the characters is pleasant. The story is contrived and much of the dialogue is silly. The conflicts all seem forced and fake. Some of the gags are humorous. Andrea Martin is still great. Many of the shots are poorly conceived. The beauty of the Greek isles is nice to see. But it feels a little like BFGW1 crossed with her Greek tour leader comedy ""My Life in Ruins"", but both of those movies are better.I like Nia Vardolos.. I just didn't like this. Movie much."
Companion,2025,6.9,A weekend getaway with friends at a remote cabin turns into chaos after it's revealed that one of the guests is not what they seem.,"Reviewers say 'Companion' is a gripping psychological thriller with fascinating characters and captivating tension, offering a fresh take on AI themes. Sophie Thatcher's compelling performance as Iris and the engaging narrative receive widespread praise. However, some critics argue the film lacks thematic depth and has a predictable plot. The inconsistent tone between horror and comedy may not appeal to all viewers. Despite these issues, strong performances and an intriguing story make it a noteworthy genre addition."
The Lighthouse,2019,7.4,Two lighthouse keepers try to maintain their sanity while living on a remote and mysterious New England island in the 1890s.,"This is precisely the type of film that will garner equal amounts of unbridled praise by the arthouse diehards, as well as criticism (and likely rejection) from a lot of other viewers. My opinion lies somewhere in the middle. I give it 6 stars for the undeniably outstanding acting (obviously, Dafoe)... and Pattinson is very impressive. Something new, yes. Effective at mood-setting, check. The b&w filming, the shots, the scenery itself... even the set, the old dilapidated coastal shack, all excellent. The dynamic between the two characters is raw and real. Is it a thought-provoking free-fall into insanity? Maybe. But... there is a such a fine line between ""arthouse"", trying something different, leaving much up to subjectivity and imagination, and... just trying a bit too hard. Mermaid labia? Hmmm. But, if part of the definition of a cinematic ""success"" is evoking emotion, then mission accomplished. Total despair, pity, fear, disgust, and a general feeling of creepery, all there."
Saw X,2023,6.6,A sick and desperate John travels to Mexico for a risky and experimental medical procedure in hopes of a miracle cure for his cancer only to discover the entire operation is a scam to defraud the most vulnerable.,"I'm a huge fan of this series. I love the original 7 and I mildly enjoy Jigsaw and Spiral. I was excited for another chapter and was not disappointed. This is a great addition to the series.Just like with the other sequels, this continues to add layers to the backstory and lore with interesting new material. And of course we have lots of cool and gruesome traps. But in many ways, this chapter is different from any of the previous.For one thing, it takes it's time building story and character. The pace ends up slower because of this, but I think it's worth it. Everything feels more fleshed out (unintended pun). We don't see the hyper-editing style this franchise is known for. And the movie overall feels a bit higher in quality of filmmaking.My only downside is a lack of surprises, for me at least. I think it might work better for people who aren't as familiar with this franchise as I am.I had a fun bloody time with this movie and look forward to any future chapters in this series. More games. More blood. More, please. (1 viewing, opening Thursday EMAX 9/28/2023)"
Superman,2025,7.3,"Superman must reconcile his alien Kryptonian heritage with his human upbringing as reporter Clark Kent. As the embodiment of truth, justice and the human way he soon finds himself in a world that views these as old-fashioned.","The movie is so terrible that I had to laugh. First, they paint Superman as bad person as the results of Lex Luther, there was no chemistry between Lois and Clark. The addition of the Justice Gang NOT the Justice League was hilarious. The concept of painting Superman as a villain has merit as an idea, but it was ridiculous as it was done in this movie. The key to making Superman movies good is to always to place him in a moral dilemma. That happened a couple of times but not on a consistent basis. What the movie best exemplified were actors that were trying hard to be serious, but the scripts were so bad and the timing so off that you ended up laughing, which is what I did, at their acting attempts. Lex Luther is a brilliant person, but he is also narcissistic. Narcissism causes him to make stupid self-serving decisions. In the movie, he does that, but his reason for that is that people of earth so well like Superman. Instead, he should have been making decisions that would help in some way to boost his ego and self-esteem on a short-term basis and not on a long term basis. If you see the movie then be sure to go to a matinee because an evening at the movies will want you thinking why did you wasted your money."
BlackBerry,2023,7.3,The story of the meteoric rise and catastrophic demise of the world's first smartphone.,"BlackBerry is a 2023 film that tells the story of the rise and fall of the BlackBerry smartphone. The film is funny, heartwarming, and ultimately tragic.The film is funny because it captures the quirks and eccentricities of the people who made BlackBerry a success. Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie are two brilliant but irritable men who are determined to make their company a success. They are constantly bickering and arguing.The film is also heartwarming because it shows the passion and dedication of the people who worked at BlackBerry. They were all committed to making the best possible product, and they were willing to work long hours and make sacrifices to achieve their goals.However, the film is ultimately tragic because it shows how BlackBerry was unable to adapt to the changing marketplace. The company was slow to innovate, and it was eventually overtaken by Apple and Samsung.Despite its tragic ending, BlackBerry is a well-made film that is sure to entertain and enlighten audiences. The film is funny, heartwarming, and thought-provoking. It is a must-see for anyone who is interested in the history of technology or the human condition.Doug is the real winner in BlackBerry because he is the only one who is able to see the writing on the wall. He knows that BlackBerry is in trouble, and he tries to warn Mike and Jim. However, they are too blinded by their own success to listen. Doug is eventually forced to leave the company, but he is able to start his own successful business.BlackBerry is a cautionary tale about the dangers of hubris. It is a reminder that even the most successful companies can fall from grace if they are not willing to adapt to change."
Babygirl,2024,5.8,A high-powered CEO puts her career and family on the line when she begins a torrid affair with her much-younger intern.,"Reviewers say 'Babygirl' has received mixed reactions, with critics praising Nicole Kidman's performance and the film's exploration of complex themes. Audience reactions are divided, with some appreciating the provocative narrative and strong performances, while others find it messy and unrealistic. Cinematography and direction are highlighted as strengths, but the story and character development are criticized for being underdeveloped and predictable. Overall, 'Babygirl' is seen as thought-provoking with strong performances, though it may not appeal to all viewers."
Book Club: The Next Chapter,2023,5.6,Follows the new journey of four best friends as they take their book club to Italy for the fun girls trip they never had.,"When an AI script generator is fed ""cliches about older women"" ""Italy tourism brochures"" and ""text from wine-themed decor items,"" this is what's spit out. I left 2/3 of the way through so I'm not technically qualified to give a full review... but I had to force myself to stay that long. Jane Fonda was particularly assaulted by the script, but none were spared. Even Italy should fire their agent over this one~ no hackneyed tourist trap was overlooked, no cliche left out. I need 118 more
characters for this review to post but the movie was so dull that further criticism is fruit hanging too low. Just. Don't. Do It."
Happy Gilmore 2,2025,6.1,Revisit Happy Gilmore's golf career after his win in the Tour Championship.,The first Half is Quite Good...then it turns in to a kids tv show with sound and graphics for children. Did Adam Sandler run out of money too? I much More enjoy an oldschool production than Some pixelmovie. No this do not impress me...The sidestorys is to weak and do not contribute much. No this Could have been better. Last part of the movie did not raise any laughs.
The Fault in Our Stars,2014,7.6,"Hazel and Gus are teenagers who meet at a cancer support group and fall in love. They both share the same acerbic wit and a love of books, especially ""An Imperial Affliction"", so they embark on a journey to visit an author in Amsterdam.","Wow. Being an avid book reader, I'm always skeptical about watching the words of my favorite books transformed and materialized on the big screen... but TFIOS stayed true to the book. The movie was absolutely lovely from beginning to end. The young actors were great. The comedy hit on all the right notes, the romance made your heart smile and the tragedy pulled at your heart strings. It really was a wonderful adaptation, and I believe it stayed as true to the book as possible without many changes where there were any. The minute it was over, I wanted to watch it again. Upon leaving the theater, I looked around and there was not one dry eye. Not even the men. If you are a big fan of the book, like myself... and are skeptical about whether this stays true. Don't be. Kudos the John Green on his first film adaptation. It was an absolute success. I'd give it a 10 out of 10 if I could... but I don't believe in ""perfect."""
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,2023,6.6,Coriolanus Snow mentors and develops feelings for the female District 12 tribute during the 10th Hunger Games.,"No matter how faithful a movie is to the book, it can't save itself from the fact that it's unneeded. Backstory to snow is fine if it adds something new to the universe, however nothing new is added here, we get taught everything we knew about the world and get tiny little snips of backstory of the origins of the Hunger Games. For the movies insane long run time, the final act of this film seems like a race to get to the end of the story. The slow paced world building it creates in the first two acts is immediately thrown out for the purpose of reaching that finish line. Unlike the last Hunger Games movies being split into two, this is the Hunger Games movie that should have been split into two. We don't get to the motivations and reasonings behind characters other than a line or two then we arrive at them. Another hour and a half of story telling could have fleshed these characters out and made the ending more meaningful. However we're left with a film that doesn't seem to ever end, masked with good acting, set design and great cinematography. But a film that is messy, long and drawn out only to be shot into a moc 10 speed at the end. Leaving this movie feel completely unnecessary."
My Oxford Year,2025,5.9,"When Anna, an ambitious young American woman, sets out for Oxford University to fulfill a childhood dream, she has her life completely on track until she meets a charming and clever local who profoundly alters both of their lives.","I watched My Oxford Year on Netflix, and honestly, I was pretty disappointed. Sophia Carson's character, Anna, was just so unlikable. She came across as way too full of herself, with this smug ego that made it hard to root for her. It was off-putting enough to make me want to switch it off at times. The storyline felt like a blatant rip-off of Me Before You-same vibes, same predictable script, just not as well done. The acting didn't help either; it was stiff and wooden across the board, like nobody was really connecting with their roles. I wanted to like it, but it just didn't deliver. Maybe it's just me, but I'd give this one a pass."
We Live in Time,2024,7.0,"After an unusual encounter, a talented chef and a recently divorc√©e fall in love and build the home and family they've always dreamed of, until a painful truth puts their love story to the test.","Reviewers say 'We Live in Time' is a heartfelt romantic drama exploring love, loss, and time. Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh deliver strong performances with notable chemistry. The non-linear narrative is ambitious, offering fresh perspectives but occasionally disrupting flow. Emotional depth and poignant moments are frequently praised, though some find the story predictable or pacing uneven. Cinematography and score enhance the emotional core. Despite mixed opinions on structure and predictability, it is generally seen as emotionally resonant."
One of Them Days,2025,6.5,"When best friends and roommates Dreux and Alyssa discover Alyssa's boyfriend has blown their rent money, the duo finds themselves going to extremes in a race against the clock to avoid eviction and keep their friendship intact.","Reviewers say 'One of Them Days' is a relatable buddy comedy featuring Keke Palmer and SZA as roommates facing eviction. Themes of friendship and financial struggles resonate, drawing comparisons to 'Friday'. Palmer and SZA's chemistry and comedic timing are praised, though some find the plot predictable and jokes uninspired. The film's pacing and direction receive mixed reviews, with some finding it engaging and others lacking depth. Overall, it's seen as an enjoyable, though not groundbreaking, comedy."
Cicaverzum,2023,4.8,"30-year-old F√°ni is trapped in a world of her own imagination. Because she pictures the death of each man she finds attractive, she can never fall in love. But everything changes when a talking black cat starts courting her.",
The Darjeeling Limited,2007,7.2,"A year after their father's funeral, three brothers travel across India by train in an attempt to bond with each other.","The Darjeeling Limited is unlike the average comedy. While not being truly laugh out loud funny, the film is clever, well written, with memorable characters and one liners that grow wittier over time. The only type of movie it can be compared to are other films by Wes Anderson, the director of Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and the love it or hate film, The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou. All of his movies are extremely stylized, with slow motion sequences, wide lenses that slightly distort the frame, and privileged, depressed characters with family issues all thrown together in a slightly artificial, timeless, carefully detailed environment. While with The Life Aquatic he may have tried to do too much, The Darjeeling Limited shows Anderson finally perfected his style. He knows when to throw inside jokes to his most loyal of fans, while keeping his stories fresh and personal, without acknowledging the critics who blame Anderson for repeating himself.The film is absolutely engaging from the very start with a hilarious, memorable cameo by Bill Murray, trying to catch the Darjeeling Limited train in slow motion, yet is outrun by Adrien Brody's Peter to the tune of The Kinks' This Time Tomorrow, one of the three Kinks songs in the film (all are accompanied by slow motion sequences). Brody, Jason Schwartzman, and Owen Wilson play the three Whitman brothers, Peter, Jack, and Francis. Wilson's character has organized a spiritual journey through India with his brothers who have not spoken to one other since their father's funeral a year ago. Performance-wise, the standout is Wilson, in what might be his best role yet. Owen Wilson seems to play himself in all of his other movies, with Wes Anderson being the only writer/director to truly know how to use his talents. The characters begin to realize that one cannot force a spiritual journey, no matter how many temples visited and organized rituals performed for brotherly bonding as printed on a laminated itinerary. The bender that results is a ridiculously entertaining blend of comedy and drama successfully aided by Anderson's great choice of music and colorful, dynamic cinematography.Extremely recommended viewing (other than Anderson's previous efforts) before watching this amazing film is Hotel Chevalier, a 13 minute short film directed by Anderson and starring Jason Schwartzman, available for free download online through Itunes. In the film, Schwartzman plays the same character that he plays in The Darjeeling Limited. Also starring is Natalie Portman as Jack's ex-girlfriend, who makes a brief cameo in the feature film as well. The short film helps establish Schwartzman's character, and provides clues on certain details of The Darjeeling Limited. Also, a couple of funny moments in the feature wouldn't make much sense without seeing the short. The emotional, yet blissful experience that is The Darjeeling Limited is Wes Anderson's best film thus far, defeating Rushmore for that top spot."
Summer Camp,2024,4.6,"Follows Nora, Ginny, and Mary, three childhood best friends who used to spend every summer at a sleep away camp together. After years, when the opportunity to get back together for a summer camp reunion presents itself, they all seize it.","Summer Camp (2024) is the latest dreadful film from Diane Keaton. This one is a total mess.Yet another one of the old lady reunions, this time it's a reunion at a summer camp where, 60 years before, three gawky girls became friends. Wow. Over the next century they've grown apart. Wow. They all come back to camp and become friends again. Wow.Keaton plays a PhD head of a research company ... but of course she's still the usual Keaton ditz. Kathy Bates plays a tough self-help guru with no private life, and Alfre Woodard plays a head nurse in a dead marriage. None of this really matters because at camp they flirt with the boys they knew 60 years before and have food fights and obsess about what they're going to wear. Written and directed by a 30-year-old female, these characters are totally stupid and unbelievable.Bates and Woodard try but the material stinks. Keaton is especially irritating with all the same schtick from her Annie Hall days. There's also Eugene Levy and Dennis Haysbert and Beverly D'Angelo. By the book and boring."
Kraven: The Hunter,2024,5.5,"Kraven's complex relationship with his ruthless father, Nikolai Kravinoff, starts him down a path of vengeance with brutal consequences, motivating him to become not only the greatest hunter in the world, but also one of its most feared.","Reviewers say 'Kraven the Hunter' garners mixed reactions, lauding Aaron Taylor-Johnson's captivating performance and Russell Crowe's strong portrayal. The film's darker tone and thrilling action scenes are often praised for refreshing the superhero genre. However, critiques frequently point to script issues, such as rushed plot points and underdeveloped characters, alongside an inconsistent tone. The CGI effects and villains, especially Rhino, are often deemed disappointing. Despite these shortcomings, many find the movie enjoyable, though it doesn't quite excel in the superhero landscape."
My Spy: The Eternal City,2024,5.7,"JJ, a veteran CIA agent, reunites with his prot√©g√© Sophie, in order to prevent a catastrophic nuclear scheme threatening Vatican City, which disrupts a high school choir trip to Italy.","The Eternal City (2024) attempts to blend comedy, action, and espionage in the picturesque setting of Rome, but struggles to recapture the charm of its predecessor. While Dave Bautista delivers his usual mix of gruffness and humor, the film's predictable plot and over-reliance on recycled jokes leave much to be desired.The action sequences are decent, and the Roman backdrop adds some visual appeal, but the story feels formulaic and lacks the emotional core that made the first installment enjoyable. The supporting cast provides some laughs, but the humor often feels forced and uneven.Overall, My Spy: The Eternal City is a passable but forgettable sequel that fails to elevate the franchise."
Sinners,2025,7.6,"Trying to leave their troubled lives behind, twin brothers return to their hometown to start again, only to discover that an even greater evil is waiting to welcome them back.","It feels like The Sinners was directed by two different Cooglers-one responsible for the first half, and another for the second. If I had to rate them separately: the first half is a solid 8, the second a disappointing 4.The film starts off brilliantly. Set in the Deep South during the 1930s, it plunges us into a world of chain gangs, overt racism, and raw human struggle-all wrapped in the soul of music. The characters are distinctive and memorable, the performances are top-notch, and the world-building is rich and atmospheric. It's a western, a drama, and a musical all at once, and somehow it works. For a while.Then comes the second half.This is where things fall apart. The pivot to horror-specifically vampires-feels abrupt and half-hearted. There's barely a story holding it together, and the horror/action sequences barely last 10-15 minutes. They lack any real suspense or memorable set pieces. The execution feels rushed and undercooked, especially after such a powerful setup.The final 5-7 minutes attempt a bold anti-Klan message, and it's likely this moment of violence and symbolism that won over many critics. But for me, it was too little, too late.What's most frustrating is the wasted potential. This could've been a truly unique vampire film-rooted in history, rich in theme, driven by character and song. Instead, it leaves you wondering what could've been if the second half had lived up to the promise of the first."
Thunderbolts*,2025,7.2,"After finding themselves ensnared in a death trap, an unconventional team of antiheroes must go on a dangerous mission that will force them to confront the darkest corners of their pasts.","Okay, so Marvel definitely succeeded to up thier game in this movie. They took it to a completely different category of storytelling. I was certainly impressed with the symbolism and how they portrayed ""depression"" and a human-being's darkness. Beautifully done in terms of tackling mental issues and shedding light into this topic. Also, the cast and assembling the ragtag team of misfits was great and funny. Good team dynamic as they were able to make them click and sync together beautifully. I loved the movie, it made my eyes tear up at some moments that were emotionally deep and genuine. Bravo Marvel Studios, you certainly nailed this one."
